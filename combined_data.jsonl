{"text": "However , while each of these systems have their advantages , they are also characterized by various drawbacks , e.g. , limited capacity for packaging of control PROTEIN , lower efficiency of packaging , complicated system construction , or complicated and time-consuming purification of produced . "}
{"text": "The newest and most advanced plasmid-driven packaging system , the so-called one-plasmid double-expression packaging system , allows construction of GENE with high efficiency and packaging specificity , and allows a maximum length of encapsidated of up to 3,600 CHEMICAL ( nt ) 11 . "}
{"text": "Recently , this packaging system was even used for the construction of GENE carrying a for Zika virus 12 . "}
{"text": "However , this system still does not address a major drawback of current MS2 PLP preparations : the purification procedure . "}
{"text": "Therefore , produced GENE must be purified in a time-consuming and laborious ultracentrifugation step , which does not isolate GENE in the . "}
{"text": "The problem of purification can be solved by the introduction of an affinity tag ( e.g. , polyhistidine-tag ; His-tag ) to the structure of GENE allowing their purification using the CHEMICAL 2+ affinity chromatography method 13,14 . "}

{"text": "Methods : We conducted a simulation in both current and ideal situation for the next month to predict the death rate and examine the reason for the difference in Italy , Iran and South Korea individually . "}
{"text": "If we assume the cultural and political factors and age pyramids distribution are similar across regions , the differences are mainly due either to the heavier health-care burden owing to the larger population or to the medical facilities diversities . "}

{"text": "We also observed that oral administration of GENE significantly increased GENE ' numbers and up-regulated the ratio of GENE + GENE + . "}
{"text": "Furthermore , high titers of specific GENE ( GENE ) revealed satisfactory systemic immune response against DISEASE . "}
{"text": "In summary , our study demonstrated that oral administration of GENE could trigger a high level of local and systemic immune responses and would be a promising candidate vaccine against DISEASE in piglets .

{"text": "Background : The advancements in DNA sequencing technologies have allowed researchers to progress from the analyses of a single organism towards the deep sequencing of a sample of organisms . "}
{"text": "With sufficient sequencing depth , it is now possible to detect subtle variations between members of the same species , or between mixed species with shared biomarkers , such as the GENE . "}

{"text": "Background : Influenza pandemic preparedness plans are currently developed and refined on national and international levels . "}
{"text": "Much attention has been given to the administration of antiviral drugs , but contact reduction can also be an effective part of mitigation strategies and has the advantage to be not limited per se . "}
{"text": "The effectiveness of these interventions depends on various factors which must be explored by sensitivity analyses , based on mathematical models . "}
{"text": "We use the freely available planning tool InfluSim to investigate how pharmaceutical and non-pharmaceutical interventions can mitigate an influenza pandemic . "}

{"text": "Conclusions : PBD-2 could inhibit PRV proliferation in and protect mice from DISEASE , which confirmed the antiviral ability of GENE both in vitro and in vivo . "}
{"text": "The application of GENE in developing anti-viral drugs or disease-resistant animals can be further investigated . "}
{"text": "Background : Fuelled by the advent and subsequent development of next generation sequencing technologies , metagenomics became a powerful tool for the analysis of microbial communities both scientifically and diagnostically . "}
{"text": "The biggest challenge is the extraction of relevant information from the huge sequence datasets generated for metagenomics studies . "}
{"text": "Although a plethora of tools are available , data analysis is still a bottleneck . "}
{"text": "Results : To overcome the bottleneck of data analysis , we developed an automated computational workflow called RIEMS -Reliable Information Extraction from Metagenomic Sequence datasets . "}
{"text": "RIEMS assigns every individual read sequence within a dataset taxonomically by cascading different sequence analyses with decreasing stringency of the assignments using various software applications . "}
{"text": "After completion of the analyses , the results are summarised in a clearly structured result protocol organised taxonomically . "}
{"text": "The high accuracy and performance of RIEMS analyses were proven in comparison with other tools for metagenomics data analysis using simulated sequencing read datasets . "}
{"text": "Conclusions : RIEMS has the potential to fill the gap that still exists with regard to data analysis for metagenomics studies . "}
{"text": "The usefulness and power of RIEMS for the analysis of genuine sequencing datasets was demonstrated with an early version of RIEMS in 2011 when it was used to detect the leading to the discovery of Schmallenberg virus . "}
{"text": "Coronaviruses cause DISEASE in humans that can range from mild to severe . "}
{"text": "However , the pathogenesis of DISEASE is poorly understood . DISEASE ( DISEASE ) is a group 2 coronavirus capable of causing severe morbidity and mortality in highly susceptible C3H/HeJ mice . "}
{"text": "We have previously shown that both GENE play a critical role in mediating DISEASE . "}
{"text": "Here we evaluated the role of ( AM ) in modulating the adaptive immune response and subsequent disease . "}
{"text": "Depletion of AM using CHEMICAL liposomes administered prior to DISEASE was associated with a significant amelioration of MHV-1induced morbidity and mortality . "}
{"text": "AM depletion resulted in a decreased number of GENE in the lung airways . "}
{"text": "In addition , a significant increase in the frequency and total number of Tregs in the lung tissue and lung airways was observed following DISEASE in mice depleted of AM . "}
{"text": "Our results indicate that AM play a critical role in modulating MHV-1-induced morbidity and mortality . "}
