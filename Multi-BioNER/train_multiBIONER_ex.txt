In
recent
years
,
affective
computing
has
been
actively
researched
to
provide
a
higher
level
of
emotion-awareness
.

Numerous
studies
have
been
conducted
to
detect
the
user
's
emotions
from
physiological
data
.

Among
a
myriad
of
target
emotions
,
boredom
,
in
particular
,
has
been
suggested
to
cause
not
only
medical
issues
but
also
challenges
in
various
facets
of
daily
life
.

However
,
to
the
best
of
our
knowledge
,
no
previous
studies
have
used
electroencephalography
(
EEG
)
and
galvanic
skin
response
(
GSR
)
together
for
boredom
classification
,
although
these
data
have
potential
features
for
emotion
classification
.

To
investigate
the
combined
effect
of
these
features
on
boredom
classification
,
we
collected
EEG
and
GSR
data
from
28
participants
using
off-the-shelf
sensors
.

During
data
acquisition
,
we
used
a
set
of
stimuli
comprising
a
video
clip
designed
to
elicit
boredom
and
two
other
video
clips
of
entertaining
content
.

The
collected
samples
were
labeled
based
on
the
participants
'
questionnaire-based
testimonies
on
experienced
boredom
levels
.

Using
the
collected
data
,
we
initially
trained
30
models
with
19
machine
learning
algorithms
and
selected
the
top
three
candidate
classifiers
.

After
tuning
the
hyperparameters
,
we
validated
the
final
models
through
1000
iterations
of
10-fold
cross
validation
to
increase
the
robustness
of
the
test
results
.

Our
results
indicated
that
a
Multilayer
Perceptron
model
performed
the
best
with
a
mean
accuracy
of
79.98
%
(
AUC
:
0.781
)
.

It
also
revealed
the
correlation
between
boredom
and
the
combined
features
of
EEG
and
GSR
.

These
results
can
be
useful
for
building
accurate
affective
computing
systems
and
understanding
the
physiological
properties
of
boredom
.

The
induction
of
immunological
memory
,
which
is
mediated
by
memory
T
and
B
cells
,
is
central
to
adaptive
protective
immunity
to
pathogens
induced
by
previous
infection
and
is
the
cornerstone
of
effective
vaccine
design
.

Recent
studies
in
mice
have
suggested
that
memory
T
cells
that
accumulate
in
tissues
,
termed
tissue-resident
memory
T
(
TRM
)
cells
,
play
a
crucial
role
in
maintaining
long-term
protective
immunity
to
mucosal
pathogens
.

CD4
and
CD8
TRM
cells
can
be
induced
following
infection
at
mucosal
sites
or
the
skin
,
where
they
are
maintained
and
poised
to
respond
rapidly
to
reinfection
with
the
same
pathogen
.

TRM
cells
can
also
be
generated
by
vaccination
,
but
their
induction
is
influenced
by
a
number
of
factors
,
including
the
type
of
vaccine
,
the
adjuvant
,
and
the
route
of
immunization
.

Live
attenuated
vaccines
appear
to
be
more
effective
than
killed
or
subunit
vaccines
at
inducing
TRM
cells
and
mucosal
immunization
,
especially
by
intranasal
route
,
is
more
effective
than
parenteral
delivery
.

However
,
evidence
is
emerging
that
formulation
of
killed
or
subunit
vaccines
with
novel
adjuvants
,
especially
those
that
generate
Th1
and
Th17
responses
,
can
promote
the
induction
of
TRM
cells
.

While
TRM
cells
are
also
present
at
high
number
in
mucosal
tissues
in
humans
,
one
of
the
challenge
will
be
to
develop
methodologies
for
routine
quantification
of
these
cells
in
humans
.

Nevertheless
,
the
identification
of
approaches
for
optimum
induction
of
TRM
cells
in
mice
should
assist
in
the
design
of
more
effective
vaccines
that
sustain
protective
immunity
against
a
range
of
human
pathogens
.

Schistosomiasis
is
one
of
the
most
widely
distributed
parasitic
diseases
in
the
world
.

Schistosoma
japonicum
,
a
zoonotic
parasite
with
a
wide
range
of
mammalian
hosts
,
is
one
of
the
major
pathogens
of
this
disease
.

Although
numerous
studies
on
schistosomiasis
japonica
have
been
performed
using
laboratory
animal
models
,
systematic
comparative
analysis
of
whole-genome
expression
profiles
in
parasites
from
different
laboratory
animals
and
nature
mammalian
hosts
is
lacking
to
date
.

Adult
schistosomes
were
obtained
from
laboratory
animals
BALB/c
mice
,
C57BL/6
mice
,
New
Zealand
white
rabbits
and
the
natural
host
,
water
buffaloes
.

The
gene
expression
profiles
of
schistosomes
from
these
animals
were
obtained
and
compared
by
genome-wide
oligonucleotide
microarray
analysis
.

The
results
revealed
that
the
gene
expression
profiles
of
schistosomes
from
different
laboratory
animals
and
buffaloes
were
highly
consistent
(
r
>
0.98
)
genome-wide
.

Meanwhile
,
a
total
of
450
genes
were
identified
to
be
differentially
expressed
in
schistosomes
which
can
be
clustered
into
six
groups
.

Pathway
analysis
revealed
that
these
genes
were
mainly
involved
in
multiple
signal
transduction
pathways
,
amino
acid
,
energy
,
nucleotide
and
lipid
metabolism
.

We
also
identified
a
group
of
1,540
abundantly
and
stably
expressed
gene
products
in
adult
worms
,
including
a
panel
of
179
Schistosomaor
Platyhelminthes-specific
genes
that
may
be
essential
for
parasitism
and
may
be
regarded
as
novel
potential
anti-parasite
intervention
targets
for
future
research
.

This
study
provides
a
comprehensive
database
of
gene
expression
profiles
of
schistosomes
derived
from
different
laboratory
animals
and
water
buffaloes
.

An
expanded
number
of
genes
potentially
affecting
the
development
of
schistosomes
in
different
animals
were
identified
.

These
findings
lay
the
foundation
for
schistosomiasis
research
in
different
laboratory
animals
and
natural
hosts
at
the
transcriptional
level
and
provide
a
valuable
resource
for
screening
anti-schistosomal
intervention
targets
.

The
zoonotic
parasite
Schistosoma
japonicum
is
one
of
the
major
pathogens
of
schistosomiasis
and
can
parasitize
a
wide
range
of
mammals
.

Although
numerous
schistosome
transcriptional
profiling
studies
have
been
performed
using
laboratory
animal
models
,
the
differences
in
the
global
gene
expression
profiles
of
worms
from
different
laboratory
animals
and
natural
mammalian
hosts
have
not
been
characterized
.

Therefore
,
we
studied
the
gene
expression
profiles
of
adult
worms
from
BALB/c
mice
,
C57BL/6
mice
,
rabbits
and
buffaloes
using
a
transcriptomics
approach
.

Our
results
indicate
that
,
although
the
expression
profiles
of
adult
worms
from
different
mammals
are
generally
similar
,
hundreds
of
genes
are
differentially
expressed
,
which
were
mainly
involved
in
various
signal
transduction
pathways
,
amino
acid
,
energy
,
nucleotide
and
lipid
metabolism
.

Numerous
abundantly
and
stably
expressed
genes
in
adults
were
identified
,
including
some
genes
that
are
only
found
in
blood
flukes
or
expanded
within
the
phylum
Platyhelminthes
and
may
be
important
for
parasitism
.

Our
data
provide
a
basis
for
schistosomiasis
research
in
different
mammalian
hosts
at
the
transcriptional
level
as
well
as
a
valuable
resource
for
the
screening
of
anti-schistosomal
intervention
targets

Public
health
messaging
about
antimicrobial
resistance
(
AMR
)
sometimes
conveys
the
problem
as
an
epidemic
.

We
outline
why
AMR
is
a
serious
endemic
problem
manifested
in
hospital
and
community-acquired
infections
.

AMR
is
not
an
epidemic
condition
,
but
may
complicate
epidemics
,
which
are
characterised
by
sudden
societal
impact
due
to
rapid
rise
in
cases
over
a
short
timescale
.

Influenza
,
which
causes
direct
viral
effects
,
or
secondary
bacterial
complications
is
the
most
likely
cause
of
an
epidemic
or
pandemic
where
AMR
may
be
a
problem
.

We
discuss
other
possible
causes
of
a
pandemic
with
AMR
,
and
present
a
risk
assessment
formula
to
estimate
the
impact
of
AMR
during
a
pandemic
.

Finally
,
we
flag
the
potential
impact
of
genetic
engineering
of
pathogens
on
global
risk
and
how
this
could
radically
change
the
epidemiology
of
AMR
as
we
know
it
.

Understanding
the
epidemiology
of
AMR
is
key
to
successfully
addressing
the
problem
.

AMR
is
an
endemic
condition
but
can
play
a
role
in
epidemics
or
pandemics
,
and
we
present
a

for
assessing
the

Porcine
reproductive
and
respiratory
syndrome
(
PRRS
)
is
a
highly
contagious
disease
in
pigs
caused
by
PRRS
virus
(
PRRSV
)
.

Although
PRRSV
infection-induced
cell
apoptosis
has
been
established
,
the
related
viral
protein
is
still
unknown
.

Here
,
we
reported
that
PRRSV
nonstructural
protein
4
(
nsp4
)
was
a
critical
apoptosis
inducer
.

Nsp4
could
activate
caspase-3
,
-8
,
and
-9
.

Using
truncated
constructs
without
different
domains
in
nsp4
,
we
demonstrated
that
the
full-length
of
nsp4
structure
was
required
for
its
apoptosis-inducing
activity
.

Furthermore
,
using
site-directed
mutagenesis
to
inactivate
the
3C-like
serine
protease
activity
of
nsp4
,
we
showed
that
nsp4-induced
apoptosis
was
dependent
on
its
serine
protease
activity
.

The
ability
of
nsp4
to
induce
apoptosis
was
significantly
impaired
by
His39
,
Asp64
,
and
Ser118
mutations
,
suggesting
that
His39
,
Asp64
,
and
Ser118
were
essential
for
nsp4
to
trigger
apoptosis
.

In
conclusion
,
our
present
work
showed
that
PRRSV
nsp4
could
induce
apoptosis
in
host
cells
and
might
be
partially
responsible
for
the
apoptosis
induced
by
PRRSV
infection
.

PRRSV
3C-like
protease-mediated
apoptosis
represents
the
first
report
in
the
genus
Arterivirus
,
family
Arteriviridae
.

Early
growth
response
gene-1
(
EGR1
)
is
a
multifunctional
transcription
factor
that
is
implicated
in
viral
infection
.

In
this
study
,
we
observed
that
foot-and-mouth
disease
virus
(
FMDV
)
infection
significantly
triggered
EGR1
expression
.

Overexpression
of
EGR1
suppressed
FMDV
replication
in
porcine
cells
,
and
knockdown
of
EGR1
considerably
promoted
FMDV
replication
.

A
previously
reported
FMDV
mutant
virus
(
with
two
amino
acids
mutations
in
SAP
domain
)
that
displays
a
strong
type
I
interferon
(
IFN
)
induction
activity
was
used
in
this
study
.

We
found
that
SAP
mutant
FMDV
infection
induced
a
higher
expression
of
EGR1
than
wildtype
FMDV
infection
,
and
also
triggered
higher
IFNÎ²
and

infection
.

This
implied
a
link
between
EGR1
and
type
I
IFN
signaling
.

Further
study
showed
that
overexpression
of
EGR1
resulted
in
Sendai
virus
(
SeV
)
-induced
IFN-stimulated
response
element
(
ISRE
)
and
NF-ÎºB
promoter
activation
.

In
addition
,
the
SeV-induced
ISGs
expression
was
impaired
in
EGR1
knockdown
cells
.

EGR1
upregulation
promoted
type
I
IFN
signaling
activation
and
suppressed
FMDV
and
Seneca
Valley
virus
replication
.

Suppression
of
the
transcriptional
activity
of
EGR1
did
not
affect
its
antiviral
effect
against
FMDV
.

This
study
reveals
a
new
mechanism
evolved
by
EGR1
to
enhance
type
I
IFN
signaling
and
suppress
FMDV

Without
viral
envelope
proteins
,
viruses
can
not
enter
cells
to
start
infection
.

As
the
major
viral
proteins
present
on
the
surface
of
virions
,
viral
envelope
proteins
are
a
prominent
target
of
the
host
immune
system
in
preventing
and
ultimately
eliminating
viral
infection
.

In
addition
to
the
well-appreciated
adaptive
immunity
that
produces
envelope
protein-specific
antibodies
and
T
cell
responses
,
recent
studies
have
begun
to
unveil
a
rich
layer
of
host
innate
immune
mechanisms
restricting
viral
entry
.

This
review
focuses
on
the
exciting
progress
that
has
been
made
in
this
new
direction
of
research
,
by
discussing
various
known
examples
of
host
restriction
of
viral
entry
,
and
diverse
viral
countering
strategies
,
in
particular
,
the
emerging
role
of
viral
envelope
proteins
in
evading
host
innate
immune
suppression
.

We
will
also
highlight
the
effective
cooperation
between
innate
and
adaptive
immunity
to
achieve
the
synergistic
control
of
viral
infection
by
targeting
viral
envelope
protein
and
checking
viral
escape
.

Given
that
many
of
the
related
findings
were
made
with
HIV-1
,
we
will
use
HIV-1
as
the
model
virus
to
illustrate
the
basic
principles
and
molecular
mechanisms
on
host
restriction
targeting
HIV-1
envelope
protein
.

Background
:
After
renovation
of
the
adult
intensive
care
unit
(
ICU
)
with
installation
of
ten
single
rooms
,
an
enhanced
infection
control
program
was
conducted
to
control
the
spread
of
methicillin-resistant
Staphylococcus
aureus
(
MRSA
)
in
our
hospital
.

Methods
:
Since
the
ICU
renovation
,
all
patients
colonized
or
infected
with
MRSA
were
nursed
in
single
rooms
with
contact
precautions
.

The
incidence
of
MRSA
infection
in
the
ICU
was
monitored
during
3
different
phases
:
the
baseline
period
(
phase
1
)
;
after
ICU
renovation
(
phase
2
)
and
after
implementation
of
a
hand
hygiene
campaign
with
alcohol-based
hand
rub
(
phase
3
)
.

Patients
infected
with
extended
spectrum
beta-lactamase
(
ESBL
)
-producing
Escherichia
coli
and
Klebsiella
species
were
chosen
as
controls
because
they
were
managed
in
open
cubicles
with
standard
precautions
.

Results
:
Without
a
major
change
in
bed
occupancy
rate
,
nursing
workforce
,
or
the
protocol
of
environmental
cleansing
throughout
the
study
period
,
a
stepwise
reduction
in
ICU
onset
nonbacteraemic
MRSA
infection
was
observed
:
from
3.54
(
phase
1
)
to
2.26
(
phase
2
,
p
=
0.042
)
and
1.02
(
phase
3
,
p
=
0.006
)
per
1000-patient-days
.

ICU
onset
bacteraemic
MRSA
infection
was
significantly
reduced
from
1.94
(
phase
1
)
to
0.9
(
phase
2
,
p
=
0.005
)
and
0.28
(
phase
3
,
p
=
0.021
)
per
1000-patient-days
.

Infection
due
to
ESBL-producing
organisms
did
not
show
a
corresponding
reduction
.

The
usage
density
of
broad-spectrum
antibiotics
and
fluoroquinolones
increased
from
phase
1
to
3
.

However
a
significant
trend
improvement
of
ICU
onset
MRSA
infection
by
segmented
regression
analysis
can
only
be
demonstrated
when
comparison
was
made
before
and
after
the
severe
acute
respiratory
syndrome
(
SARS
)
epidemic
.

This
suggests
that
the
deaths
of
fellow
healthcare
workers
from
an
occupational
acquired
infection
had
an
overwhelming
effect
on
their
compliance
with
infection
control
measures
.

Conclusion
:
Provision
of
single
room
isolation
facilities
and
promotion
of
hand
hygiene
practice
are
important
.

However
compliance
with
infection
control
measures
relies
largely
on
a
personal
commitment
,
which
may
increase
when
personal
safety
is
threatened
.

During
lytic
Kaposi
's
sarcoma-associated
herpesvirus
(
KSHV
)
infection
,
the
viral
endonuclease
SOX
promotes
widespread
degradation
of
cytoplasmic
messenger
RNA
(
mRNA
)
.

However
,
select
mRNAs
,
including
the
transcript
encoding
interleukin-6
(
IL-6
)
,
escape
SOX-induced
cleavage
.

IL-6
escape
is
mediated
through
a
3
'
UTR
RNA
regulatory
element
that
overrides
the
SOX
targeting
mechanism
.

Here
,
we
reveal
that
this
protective
RNA
element
functions
to
broadly
restrict
cleavage
by
a
range
of
homologous
and
non-homologous
viral
endonucleases
.

However
,
it
does
not
impede
cleavage
by
cellular
endonucleases
.

The
IL-6
protective
sequence
may
be
representative
of
a
larger
class
of
nuclease
escape
elements
,
as
we
identified
a
similar
protective
element
in
the
GADD45B
mRNA
.

The
IL-6
and
GADD45B-derived
elements
display
similarities
in
their
sequence
,
putative
structure
,
and
several
associated
RNA
binding
proteins
.

However
,
the
overall
composition
of
their
ribonucleoprotein
complexes
appears
distinct
,
leading
to
differences
in
the
breadth
of
nucleases
restricted
.

These
findings
highlight
how
RNA
elements
can
selectively
control
transcript
abundance
in
the
background
of
widespread
virus-induced
mRNA
degradation
.

Tilapia
lake
virus
(
TiLV
)
is
a
negative-sense
single-stranded
RNA
(
-ssRNA
)
icosahedral
virus
classified
to
be
the
only
member
in
the
family
Amnoonviridae
.

Although
TiLV
segment-1
shares
homology
with
the
influenza
C
virus
PB1
and
has
four
conserved
motifs
similar
to
influenza
A
,
B
,
and
C
polymerases
,
it
is
unknown
whether
there
are
other
properties
shared
between
TiLV
and
orthomyxovirus
.

In
the
present
study
,
we
wanted
to
determine
whether
TiLV
agglutinated
avian
and
piscine
erythrocytes
,
and
whether
its
replication
was
inhibited
by
lysosomotropic
agents
,
such
as
ammonium
chloride
(
NH
4
Cl
)
,
as
seen
for
orthomyxoviruses
.

Our
findings
showed
that
influenza
virus
strain
A/Puerto
Rico/8
(
PR8
)
was
able
to
hemagglutinate
turkey
(
Meleagris
gallopavo
)
,
Atlantic
salmon
(
Salmo
salar
L
)
,
and
Nile
tilapia
(
Oreochromis
niloticus
)
red
blood
cells
(
RBCs
)
,
while
infectious
salmon
anemia
virus
(
ISAV
)
only
agglutinated
Atlantic
salmon
,
but
not
turkey
or
tilapia
,
RBCs
.

In
contrast
to
PR8
and
ISAV
,
TiLV
did
not
agglutinate
turkey
,
Atlantic
salmon
,
or
tilapia
RBCs
.

qRT-PCR
analysis
showed
that
30
mM
NH
4
Cl
,
a
basic
lysosomotropic
agent
,
neither
inhibited
nor
enhanced
TiLV
replication
in
E-11
cells
.

There
was
no
difference
in
viral
quantities
in
the
infected
cells
with
or
without
NH
4
Cl
treatment
during
virus
adsorption
or
at
1
,
2
,
and
3
h
post-infection
.

Given
that
hemagglutinin
proteins
that
bind
RBCs
also
serve
as
ligands
that
bind
host
cells
during
virus
entry
leading
to
endocytosis
in
orthomyxoviruses
,
the
data
presented
here
suggest
that
TiLV
may
use
mechanisms
that
are
different
from
orthomyxoviruses
for
entry
and
replication
in
host
cells
.

Therefore
,
future
studies
should
seek
to
elucidate
the
mechanisms
used
by
TiLV
for
entry
into
host
cells
and
to
determine
its
mode
of
replication
in
infected
cells
.

Porcine
deltacoronavirus
(
PDCoV
)
is
a
newly
emerged
swine
enteropathogenic
coronavirus
affecting
pigs
of
all
ages
and
causing
diarrhea
problems
.

Research
findings
indicate
that
PDCoV
has
evolved
strategies
to
escape
innate
immune
response
in
host
cells
,
but
mechanism
of
PDCoV
in
innate

modulation
is
not
well
understood
.

In
this
study
,
we
report
our
findings
on
identifying
the
alterations
of

with

The

results
indicated
that
extensive
gene

signaling
pathways
including
innate
immuneassociated
functions
and
pathways
were
affected
by

,
4
of
5
innate
immune

pathways
,
which
were
primarily
affected
by

,
played
important
roles
in
I-IFN

Additionally
,
16

predicted
as

contributors
to
the

.

Our
research
findings
indicated
that
the
innate
immune-associated
genes
and
signaling
pathways
in
PK-15
cells
could
be
modified
by
the

,
which
provides
a
fundamental
foundation
for
further
studies
to
better

Background
:
RNA
interference
(
RNAi
)
is
a
valuable
tool
in
the
investigation
of
gene
function
.

The
purpose
of
this
study
was
to
examine
the
availability
,
target
cell
types
and
efficiency
of
RNAi
in
the
mouse
seminiferous
epithelium
.

The
experimental
model
was
based
on
transgenic
mice
expressing
EGFP
(
enhanced
green
fluorescent
protein
)
.

RNAi
was
induced
by
in
vivo
transfection
of
plasmid
vectors
encoding
for
short
hairpin
RNAs
(
shRNAs
)
targeting
EGFP
.

shRNAs
were
transfected
in
vivo
by
microinjection
into
the
seminiferous
tubules
via
the
rete
testis
followed
by
square
wave
electroporation
.

As
a
transfection
reporter
,
expression
of
red
fluorescent
protein
(
HcRed
1
)
was
used
.

Cell
types
,
the
efficiency
of
both
transfections
and
RNAi
were
all
evaluated
.

A
reduction
of
about
40
%
in
the
level
of
EGFP
protein
was
detected
in
cells
successfully
transfected
both
in
vivo
and
in
vitro
.

However
,
the
efficiency
of
in
vivo
transfection
was
low
.

In
adult
seminiferous
epithelial
cells
,
in
vivo
post-transcriptional
gene
silencing
mediated
by
RNAi
via
shRNA
is
efficient
in
Sertoli
cells
.

Similar
levels
of
RNAi
were
detected
both
in
vivo
and
in
vitro
.

This
also
indicates
that
Sertoli
cells
have
the
necessary
silencing
machinery
to
repress
the
expression
of
endogenous
genes
via
RNAi
.

Human
metapneumovirus
(
hMPV
)
is
a
widely
distributed
pathogen
responsible
for
acute
upper
and
lower
respiratory
infections
of
varying
severity
.

Previously
,
we
reported
that
Nsulfonated
derivatives
of
poly
(
allylamine
hydrochloride
)
(
NSPAHs
)
efficiently
inhibit
replication
of
the
influenza
virus
in
vitro
and
ex
vivo
.

Here
,
we
show
a
dose
dependent
inhibition
of
hMPV
infection
by
NSPAHs
in
LLC-MK2
cells
.

The
results
showed
strong
antiviral
properties
of
NSPAHs
.

While
the
activity
of
NSPAHs
is
comparable
to
those
of
carrageenans
,
they
show
better
physicochemical
properties
and
may
be
delivered
at
high
concentrations
.

The
functional
assays
showed
that
tested
polymers
block
hMPV
release
from
infected
cells
and
,
consequently
,
constrain
virus
spread
.

Moreover
,
further
studies
on
viruses
utilizing
different
egress
mechanisms
suggest
that
observed
antiviral
effect
depend
on
selective
inhibition
of
viruses
budding
from
the
cell
surface

Background
:
SARS
coronavirus
(
SARS-CoV
)
is
the
etiologic
agent
of
the
severe
acute
respiratory
syndrome
.

SARS-CoV
mainly
infects
tissues
of
non-lymphatic
origin
,
and
the
cytokine
profile
of
those
cells
can
determine
the
course
of
disease
.

Here
,
we
investigated
the
cytokine
response
of
two
human
non-lymphatic
cell
lines
,
Caco-2
and
HEK
293
,
which
are
fully
permissive
for
SARS-CoV
.

A
comparison
with
established
cytokine-inducing
viruses
revealed
that
SARS-CoV
only
weakly
triggered
a
cytokine
response
.

In
particular
,
SARS-CoV
did
not
activate
significant
transcription
of
the
interferons
IFN-Î±
,
IFN-Î²
,
IFN-Î»1
,
IFN-Î»2/3
,
as
well
as
of
the
interferoninduced
antiviral
genes
ISG56
and
MxA
,
the
chemokine
RANTES
and
the
interleukine
IL-6
.

Interestingly
,
however
,
SARS-CoV
strongly
induced
the
chemokines
IP-10
and
IL-8
in
the
colon
carcinoma
cell
line
Caco-2
,
but
not
in
the
embryonic
kidney
cell
line
293
.

Our
data
indicate
that
SARS-CoV
suppresses
the
antiviral
cytokine
system
of
nonimmune
cells
to
a
large
extent
,
thus
buying
time
for
dissemination
in
the
host
.

However
,
synthesis
of
IP-10
and
IL-8
,
which
are
established
markers
for
acute-stage
SARS
,
escapes
the
virus-induced
silencing
at
least
in
some
cell
types
.

Therefore
,
the
progressive
infiltration
of
immune
cells
into
the
infected
lungs
observed
in
SARS
patients
could
be
due
to
the
production
of
these
chemokines
by
the
infected
tissue
cells
.

Epitope
mapping
from
affinity-selected
peptides
has
become
popular
in
epitope
prediction
,
and
correspondingly
many
Web-based
tools
have
been
developed
in
recent
years
.

However
,
the
performance
of
these
tools
varies
in
different
circumstances
.

To
address
this
problem
,
we
employed
an
ensemble
approach
to
incorporate
two
popular
Web
tools
,
MimoPro
and
Pep-3D-Search
,
together
for
taking
advantages
offered
by
both
methods
so
as
to
give
users
more
options
for
their
specific
purposes
of
epitope-peptide
mapping
.

The
combined
operation
of
Union
finds
as
many
associated
peptides
as
possible
from
both
methods
,
which
increases
sensitivity
in
finding
potential
epitopic
regions
on
a
given
antigen
surface
.

The
combined
operation
of
Intersection
achieves
to
some
extent
the
mutual
verification
by
the
two
methods
and
hence
increases
the
likelihood
of
locating
the
genuine
epitopic
region
on
a
given
antigen
in
relation
to
the
interacting
peptides
.

The
Consistency
between
Intersection
and
Union
is
an
indirect
sufficient
condition
to
assess
the
likelihood
of
successful
peptide-epitope
mapping
.

On
average
from
27
tests
,
the
combined
operations
of
PepMapper
outperformed
either
MimoPro
or
Pep-3D-Search
alone
.

Therefore
,
PepMapper
is
another
multipurpose
mapping
tool
for
epitope
prediction
from
affinity-selected
peptides
.

Background
:
Healthcare
workers
(
HCWs
)
will
be
key
players
in
any
response
to
pandemic
influenza
,
and
will
be
in
the
front
line
of
exposure
to
infection
.

Responding
effectively
to
a
pandemic
relies
on
the
majority
of
medical
,
nursing
,
laboratory
and
hotel
services
staff
continuing
to
work
normally
.

Planning
assumes
that
during
a
pandemic
normal
healthcare
service
levels
will
be
provided
,
although
it
anticipates
that
as
caseloads
increase
only
essential
care
will
be
provided
.

The
ability
of
the
NHS
to
provide
expected
service
levels
is
entirely
dependent
upon
HCWs
continuing
to
work
as
normal
.

Methods/design
:
This
study
is
designed
as
a
two-phase
multi-method
study
,
incorporating
focus
groups
and
a
questionnaire
survey
.

In
phase
one
,
qualitative
methods
will
be
used
to
collect
the
views
of
a
purposive
sample
of
HCWs
,
to
determine
the
range
of
factors
associated
with
their
responses
to
the
prospect
of
working
through
pandemic
influenza
.

In
phase
two
,
the
findings
from
the
focus
groups
,
combined
with
the
available
literature
,
will
be
used
to
inform
the
design
of
a
survey
to
determine
the
generalisability
of
these
factors
,
enabling
the
estimation
of
the
likely
proportion
of
HCWs
affected
by
each
factor
,
and
how
likely
it
is
that
they
would
be
willing
and/or
able
to
continue
to
work
during
an
influenza
pandemic
.

There
are
potentially
greater
than
normal
health
risks
for
some
healthcare
workers
working
during
a
pandemic
,
and
these
workers
may
be
concerned
about
infecting
family
members/
friends
.

HCWs
will
be
as
liable
as
other
workers
to
care
for
sick
family
members
and
friends
.

It
is
vital
to
have
information
about
how
motivated
HCWs
will
be
to
continue
to
work
during
such
a
crisis
,
and
what
factors
might
influence
their
decision
to
work/not
to
work
.

Through
the
identification
and
subsequent
management
of
these
factors
it
may
be
possible
to
implement
strategies
that
will
alleviate
the
concerns
and
fears
of
HCWs
and
remove
potential
barriers
to
working
.

Background
:
In
December
2019
,
an
outbreak
of
respiratory
illness
caused
by
a
novel
coronavirus
(
2019-nCoV
)
emerged
in
Wuhan
,
China
and
has
swiftly
spread
to
other
parts
of
China
and
a
number
of
foreign
countries
.

The
2019-nCoV
cases
might
have
been
under-reported
roughly
from
1
to
15
January
2020
,
and
thus
we
estimated
the
number
of
unreported
cases
and
the
basic
reproduction
number
,
R
0
,
of
2019-nCoV
.

Methods
:
We
modelled
the
epidemic
curve
of
2019-nCoV
cases
,
in
mainland
China
from
1
December
2019
to
24
January
2020
through
the
exponential
growth
.

The
number
of
unreported
cases
was
determined
by
the
maximum
likelihood
estimation
.

We
used
the
serial
intervals
(
SI
)
of
infection
caused
by
two
other
well-known
coronaviruses
(
CoV
)
,
Severe
Acute
Respiratory
Syndrome
(
SARS
)
and
Middle
East
Respiratory
Syndrome
(
MERS
)
CoVs
,
as
approximations
of
the
unknown
SI
for
2019-nCoV
to
estimate
R
0
.

Results
:
We
confirmed
that
the
initial
growth
phase
followed
an
exponential
growth
pattern
.

The
under-reporting
was
likely
to
have
resulted
in
469
(
95
%
CI
:
403-540
)
unreported
cases
from
1
to
15
January
2020
.

The
reporting
rate
after
17
January
2020
was
likely
to
have
increased
21-fold
(
95
%
CI
:
18-25
)
in
comparison
to
the
situation
from
1
to
17
January
2020
on
average
.

We
estimated
the
R
0
of
2019-nCoV
at
2.56
(
95
%
CI
:
2.49-2.63
)
.

Conclusion
:
The
under-reporting
was
likely
to
have
occurred
during
the
first
half
of
January
2020
and
should
be
considered
in
future
investigation

Human
apolipoprotein
B
mRNA-editing
enzyme-catalytic
polypeptide-like
3
(
A3
)
proteins
are
a
family
of
cytidine
deaminases
that
catalyze
the
conversion
of
deoxycytidine
(
dC
)
to
deoxyuridine
(
dU
)
in
single-stranded
DNA
(
ssDNA
)
.

A3
proteins
act
in
the
innate
immune
response
to
viral
infection
by
mutating
the
viral
ssDNA
.

One
of
the
most
well-studied
human
A3
family
members
is
A3G
,
which
is
a
potent
inhibitor
of
HIV-1
.

Each
A3
protein
prefers
a
specific
substrate
sequence
for
catalysis-for
example
,
A3G
deaminates
the
third
dC
in
the
CCCA
sequence
motif
.

However
,
the
interaction
between
A3G
and
ssDNA
is
difficult
to
characterize
due
to
poor
solution
behavior
of
the
full-length
protein
and
loss
of
DNA
affinity
of
the
truncated
protein
.

Here
,
we
present
a
novel
DNA-anchoring
fusion
strategy
using
the
protection
of
telomeres
protein
1
(
Pot1
)
which
has
nanomolar
affinity
for
ssDNA
,
with
which
we
captured
an
A3G-ssDNA
interaction
.

We
crystallized
a
non-preferred
adenine
in
the
-1
nucleotide-binding
pocket
of
A3G
.

The
structure
reveals
a
unique
conformation
of
the
catalytic
site
loops
that
sheds
light
onto
how
the
enzyme
scans
substrate
in
the
-1
pocket
.

Furthermore
,
our
biochemistry
and
virology
studies
provide
evidence
that
the
nucleotidebinding
pockets
on
A3G
influence
each
other
in
selecting
the
preferred
DNA
substrate
.

Together
,
the
results
provide
insights
into
the
mechanism
by
which
A3G
selects
and
deaminates
its
preferred
substrates
and
help
define
how
A3
proteins
are
tailored
to
recognize
specific
DNA
sequences
.

This
knowledge
contributes
to
a
better
understanding
of
the
mechanism
of
DNA
substrate
selection
by
A3G
,
as
well
as
A3G
antiviral
activity
against
HIV-1
.

Temperate
phages
are
considered
as
natural
vectors
for
gene
transmission
among
bacteria
due
to
the
ability
to
integrate
their
genomes
into
a
host
chromosome
,
therefore
,
affect
the
fitness
and
phenotype
of
host
bacteria
.

Many
virulence
genes
of
pathogenic
bacteria
were
identified
in
temperate
phage
genomes
,
supporting
the
concept
that
temperate
phages
play
important
roles
in
increasing
the
bacterial
pathogenicity
through
delivery
of
the
virulence
genes
.

However
,
little
is
known
about
the
roles
of
temperate
phages
in
attenuation
of
bacterial
virulence
.

Here
,
we
report
a
novel
Bordetella
bronchiseptica
temperate
phage
,
vB_BbrS_PHB09
(
PHB09
)
,
which
has
a
42,129-bp
dsDNA
genome
with
a
G+C
content
of
62.8
%
.

Phylogenetic
analysis
based
on
large
terminase
subunit
indicated
that
phage
PHB09
represented
a
new
member
of
the
family
Siphoviridae
.

The
genome
of
PHB09
contains
genes
encoding
lysogen-associated
proteins
,
including
integrase
and
cI
protein
.

The
integration
site
of
PHB09
is
specifically
located
within
a
pilin
gene
of
B.
bronchiseptica
.

Importantly
,
we
found
that
the
integration
of
phage
PHB09
significantly
decreased
the
virulence
of
parental
strain
B.
bronchiseptica
Bb01
in
mice
,
most
likely
through
disruption
the
expression
of
pilin
gene
.

Moreover
,
a
single
shot
of
the
prophage
bearing
B.
bronchiseptica
strain
completely
protected
mice
against
lethal
challenge
with
wild-type
virulent
B.
bronchiseptica
,
indicating
the
vaccine
potential
of
lysogenized
strain
.

Our
findings
not
only
indicate
the
complicated
roles
of
temperate
phages
in
bacterial
virulence
other
than
simple
delivery
of
virulent
genes
but
also
provide
a
potential
strategy
for
developing
bacterial
vaccines
.

as
their
binding
receptor
CXCR2
,
which
was
enriched
within
the
spinal
cord
during
chronic
infection
.

Inhibiting
CXCR2
signaling
with
neutralizing
antiserum
significantly
(
p,0.03
)
delayed
clinical
recovery
.

Moreover
,
CXCR2
neutralization
was
associated
with
an
increase
in
the
severity
of
demyelination
that
was
independent
of
viral
recrudescence
or
modulation
of
neuroinflammation
.

Rather
,
blocking
CXCR2
was
associated
with
increased
numbers
of
apoptotic
cells
primarily
within
white
matter
tracts
,
suggesting
that
oligodendrocytes
were
affected
.

JHMV
infection
of
enriched
oligodendrocyte
progenitor
cell
(
OPC
)
cultures
revealed
that
apoptosis
was
associated
with
elevated
expression
of
cleaved
caspase
3
and
muted
Bcl-2
expression
.

Inclusion
of
CXCL1
within
JHMV
infected
cultures
restricted
caspase
3
cleavage
and
increased
Bcl-2
expression
that
was
associated
with
a
significant
(
p,0.001
)
decrease
in
apoptosis
.

CXCR2
deficient
oligodendrocytes
were
refractory
to
CXCL1
mediated
protection
from
JHMV
-induced
apoptosis
,
readily
activating
caspase
3
and
down
regulating
Bcl-2
.

Conclusion/Significance
:
These
findings
highlight
a
previously
unappreciated
role
for
CXCR2
signaling
in
protecting
oligodendrocyte
lineage
cells
from
apoptosis
during
inflammatory
demyelination
initiated
by
viral
infection
of
the
CNS
.

Background
:
Over
the
past
decade
there
has
been
increasing
interest
in
the
use
of
lactic
acid
bacteria
as
mucosal
delivery
vehicles
for
vaccine
antigens
,
microbicides
and
therapeutics
.

We
investigated
the
mechanism
by
which
a
mucosal
vaccine
based
in
recombinant
lactic
acid
bacteria
breaks
the
immunological
tolerance
of
the
gut
in
order
to
elicit
a
protective
immune
response
.

Methodology/Principal
Findings
:
We
analyzed
how
the
lipid
modification
of
OspA
affects
the
localization
of
the
antigen
in
our
delivery
vehicle
using
a
number
of
biochemistry
techniques
.

Furthermore
,
we
examined
how
OspA-expressing
L.
plantarum
breaks
the
oral
tolerance
of
the
gut
by
stimulating
human
intestinal
epithelial
cells
,
peripheral
blood
mononuclear
cells
and
monocyte
derived
dendritic
cells
and
measuring
cytokine
production
.

We
show
that
the
leader
peptide
of
OspA
targets
the
protein
to
the
cell
envelope
of
L.
plantarum
,
and
it
is
responsible
for
protein
export
across
the
membrane
.

Mutation
of
the
lipidation
site
in
OspA
redirects
protein
localization
within
the
cell
envelope
.

Further
,
we
show
that
lipidated-OspA-expressing
L.
plantarum
does
not
induce
secretion
of
the
pro-inflammatory
cytokine
IL-8
by
intestinal
epithelial
cells
.

In
addition
,
it
breaks
oral
tolerance
of
the
gut
via
Th1/Th2
cell
mediated
immunity
,
as
shown
by
the
production
of
pro-and
anti-inflammatory
cytokines
by
human
dendritic
cells
,
and
by
the
production
of
IgG2a
and
IgG1
antibodies
,
respectively
.

Conclusions/Significance
:
Lipid
modification
of
OspA
expressed
in
L.
plantarum
modulates
the
immune
response
to
this
antigen
through
a
Th1/Th2
immune
response
.

The
prevalence
of
preexisting
immunity
to
adenoviruses
in
the
majority
of
the
human
population
might
adversely
impact
the
development
of
adaptive
immune
responses
against
adenovirus
vector-based
vaccines
.

To
address
this
issue
,
we
primed
BALB/c
mice
either
intranasally
(
i.n

)

or
intramuscularly
(

with
varying
doses
of
wild

(

)
human
adenovirus
subtype

(
HAd5
)
.

Following
the
development
of
immunity
against
HAd5
,
we
immunized
animals
via
the
i.n

route
of

with

.

The
immunogenicity
and
protection
results
suggest
that
low
levels
of
vector
immunity
(
,520
virus-neutralization
titer
)
induced
by
priming
mice
with
up
to
10

plaque
forming

(
p.f.u
.
)

of
HAd-WT
did
not
adversely
impact
the
protective
efficacy
of
the
vaccine
.

Furthermore
,
high
levels
of
vector
immunity
(
approximately
1500
virusneutralization
titer
)
induced
by
priming
mice
with
10

p.f.u
.

of
HAd-WT
were
overcome
by
either
increasing
the
vaccine
dose
or
using
alternate
routes
of
vaccination
.

A
further
increase
in
the
priming
dose
to
10
9
p.f.u
.

allowed
only
partial
protection
.

These
results
suggest
possible
strategies
to
overcome
the
variable
levels
of
human
immunity
against
adenoviruses
,
leading
to
better
utilization
of
HAd
vector-based
vaccines

Neonatal
calves
possess
a
very
immature
and
naÃ¯ve
immune
system
and
are
reliant
on
the
intake
of
maternal
colostrum
for
passive
transfer
of
immunoglobulins
.

Variation
in
colostrum
management
of
beef
and
dairy
calves
is
thought
to
affect
early
immune
development
.

Therefore
,
the
objective
of
this
study
was
to
examine
changes
in
gene
expression
and
investigate
molecular
pathways
involved
in
the
immune-competence
development
of
neonatal
Holstein
dairy
calves
and
naturally
suckled
beef
calves
using
next
generation
RNA-sequencing
during
the
first
week
of
life
.

Jugular
whole
blood
samples
were
collected
from
Holstein

)
dairy
calves
(
n
=
8
)
artificially
fed
5
%

colostrum
,
and
from
beef
calves
which
were
the
progenies
of
Charolais-Limousin
(
CL
;
n
=
7
)
and
Limousin-Friesian
beef
suckler
cows
(
LF
;
n
=
7
)
,
for
subsequent
RNA
isolation
.

In
dairy
calves
,
there
was
a
surge
in
pro-inflammatory
cytokine
gene
expression
possibly
due
to
the
stress
of
separation
from
the
dam
.

LF
calves
exhibited
early
signs
of
humoral
immune
development
with
observed
increases
in
the
expression
genes
coding
for
Ig
receptors
,
which
was
not
evident
in
the
other
breeds
by
7
days
of
age
.

Immune
and
health
related
DEGs
identified
as
upregulated
in
beef
calves
are
prospective
contender
genes
for
the
classification
of
biomarkers
for
immune-competence
development
,
and
will
contribute
towards
a
greater
understanding
of
the
development
of
an
immune
response
in
neonatal
calves
.

New-born
calves
are
immunologically
naÃ¯ve
at
birth
,
offering
the
ideal
scenario
to
observe
the
development
of
immunocompetence
through
time
.

The
protection
of
the
womb
environment
during
the
pre-partum
period
,
coupled
with
syndesmochorial
placentation
,
results
in
a
lack
of
experience
to
pathogens
,
meaning
that
calves
are
born
with
an
essentially
non-functional
immune
response
1
.

Development
of
immunocompetence
in
calves
relies
on
successful
absorption
of
maternal
colostrum
derived
immunoglobulins
,
which
in
turn
is
dependent
upon
successful
colostrum
management
.

The
importance
of
colostrum-derived
passive
immunity
,
through
intestinal
absorption
of
colostral
immunoglobulins
,
to
the
mortality
,
morbidity
,
and
subsequent
growth
and
welfare
of
a
newborn
calf
is
recognised
internationally
2-5
.

Consequently
,
colostrum
feeding
management
is
of
critical
importance
to
the
health
and
vitality
of
the
calf
,
in
order
to
confer
protection
from
the
various
septicemic
and
enteric
diseases
that
they
are
susceptible
to
in
early
life
2
.

Failure
of
passive
transfer
of
colostrum
derived
IgGs
(
FPT
,
serum
IgG
<
10
mg/mL
)
markedly
increases
morbidity
and
mortality
in
calves
3-5
.

There
is
tremendous
variation
in
the
passive
immune
status
of
dairy
calves
3,6-8
and
,
generally
passive
immunity
of
dairy
calves
is
much
lower
than
beef
calves
7
.

This
difference
is
primarily
attributed
to
differences
in
colostrum
Ig
levels
,
whereby
dairy
cows
produce
relatively
large
volumes
of
colostrum
with
relatively
low
concentrations
of
Ig
while
beef
cows
produce
the
opposite
3
,
9
,
10
.

In
the
suckled
beef
calf
,
there
are
also
large
differences
in
passive
immunity
between
cow
breed
types
3,8
.

The
use
of
a
systems
approach
such
as
RNA
sequencing
offers
advantages
over
other
molecular
based
techniques
such
as
microarray
,
enabling
unbiased
opportunities
towards
the
profiling
of
developing
immunocompetence
using
a
global
unbiased
view
of
relative
transcriptomic
alterations

Peripheral
whole
blood
samples
are
commonly
used
for
immunological
studies
as
they
are
easily
obtained
and
may
provide
an
insight
into
immune
development
,

when
combined
with
a

,
utilizing
the
whole

,
we
aim
to

the
molecular

in
the
development
of
immunocompetence
,
from

through
the

Understanding
such

would
be
a

towards
integrating

to

,
the
first

Objectives
:
The
main
aim
of
the
current
research
was
to
investigate
the
effects
of
Glycyrrhiza
glabra
(
liquorice
root
)
on
HSV-1
.

One
of
the
objectives
of
the
current
research
was
to
determine
the
efficacy
and
the
effect
of
the
elapsed
incubation
time
of
treating
the
Vero

,
preincubation
of
virus
with
licorice

,
and
the
antiviral
activity
were
assessed
.

Patients
and
Methods
:
Vero
cells
were
incubated
after
adding
different
concentrations
of
aqueous
extracts
of
G.
glabra
.

The
cells
were
incubated
during
various
time
courses

,
determining
the
50

)
,
and
incubation
of
HSV-1
with
licorice

extract
prior
to
viral
infection
were
performed
.

Results
:
Internal
association
among
different
experiment
groups
showed
the
significant
difference
in
the
efficacy
of
the
extract
with
regard
to
incubation
period
between
one

Moreover
,
there
was
a
significant
difference
with
regard
to
efficacy
among
the
pretreatment
of

.

Conclusions
:
G.
glabra
showed
the
characteristics
of
a
novel
antiviral
medication
;
however
,
more
in
vitro
experiments
are
needed
to
determine
the
antiherpetic
activities
of
the
G.
glabra
.

Herpes
simplex

resistance
to
drugs
and
the
side

consumption
have
drawn
the
attention
of
investigators
to
find
new
medicines
;
herbal
plants
such
as
Glycyrrhiza
glabra
may
be
a
novel
choice
for
antiviral
treatment
.

Human
immunodeficiency
virus
(
HIV
)
is
a
global
health
concern

millions
of
individuals
with
a
wide
variety
of
currently
circulating
subtypes
affecting
various
regions
of
the

.

HIV
relies
on
multiple
regulatory

to
modify
the
host
cell
to
promote
replication
in
infected
T

,
and
these
regulatory
proteins
can
have
subtle
phenotypic
differences
between
subtypes
.

One

However
,
the

not
been
explored

TatB
,
from

B
,
was
found
to
be
a
potent
RSS
activator
by
40
%
whereas
TatC
,
from
HIV-1
subtype
C
,
showed
15

RSS
activity
while
subtype
TatC
variants
exhibited
varying
levels
.

A
high
level
of
cell
death
(
50-53
%
)
was
induced
by
subtype
TatB
when
compared
to
subtype
TatC
(
25-28
%
)
and
varying
levels
were
observed
with
subtype
TatC
variants
.

These
differential
activities
could
be
due
to
variations
in
the
functional
domains
of
Tat
.

These
observations

understanding

Cathepsin
L
(
CTSL
)
has
been
proved
to
help
contain
leishmaniasis
and
mycoplasma
infection
in
mice
by
supporting
cellular
immune
responses
,
but
the
regulatory
functions
of
CTSL
on
mucosal
immune
responses
have
n't
been
tested
and
remain
undefined
.

Here
,
we
investigated
the
effects
of
CTSL
on
SIgA
responses
and
invariant
chain
(
Ii
)
degradations
in
the
cocultured
swine
dendritic
cells
(
DCs
)
and
B
cells
system
in

.

When
the
cells
system
were
transfected
with
vector
CTSL-GFP
or
incubated
with
recombinant
CTSL
(
rCTSL
)
before
they
were
infected
with
Mycoplasma
hyopneumoniae
(
M.hp
)
,
SIgA
significantly
increased
and
Ii
chain
was
degraded
into
smaller
intermediates
,
while
SIgA
decreased
when
CTSL
was
knockdown
or
inhibited
with
E64
.

To
confirm
the
SIgA
responses
promoted
by
CTSL
contribute
to
the
resistance
to
mycoplasma
pneumonia
,
pigs
injected
with
rCTSL
before
they
were
challenged
with
M.hp
,
showed
milder
clinical
symptoms
and
histopathological
damage
of
lungs
,
less
mycoplasma
burden
together
with
higher
secretion
of
SIgA
,
percentages
of
CD4
+
T
cells
and
level
of
MHC
II
molecules
comparing
with
the
group
without
rCTSL
.

Collectively
,
these
results
suggested
that
rCTSL
could
provide
effective
protection
for
piglets
against
mycoplasma
pneumonia
by
enhancing
M.hp-specific
mucosal
immune
responses
through
its
role
in
antigen
presentation
by
processing
the
invariant
chain
.

Background
:
Porcine
reproductive
and
respiratory
syndrome
virus
(
PRRSV
)
induces
one
of
most
important
devastating
disease
of
swine
worldwide
,
and
the
current
methods
poorly
control
it
.

Previous
studies
have
indicated
that
the
nonstructural
protein
11
(
nsp11
)
of
PRRSV
may
be
an
important
protein
for
the
immune
escape
of
PRRSV
.

Results
:
Here
,
we
firstly
explored
the
effect
of
over-expression
of
nsp11
on
PRRSV
infection
and
found
that
over-expression
of
nsp11
enhanced
the
PRRSV
titers
while
the
small
interfering
RNA
(
siRNAs
)
specifically
targeting
nsp11
could
reduce
the
PRRSV
titers
in
MARC-145
cells
.

Conclusion
:
In
conclusion
,
PRRSV
nsp11
promotes
PRRSV
infection
in
MARC-145
cells
and
siRNAs
targeting
nsp11
may
be
a
potential
therapeutic
strategy
to
control
PRRSV
in
future

Human
Bocavirus
(
HBoV
)
was
discovered
in
2005
using
a
molecular
virus
screening
technique
.

It
is
often
found
in
respiratory
samples
and
is
a
likely
cause
for
respiratory
diseases
in
children
.

HBoV
is
distributed
worldwide
and
has
been
found
not
only
in
respiratory
samples
,
but
also
in
feces
,
urine
and
serum
.

HBoV
infections
are
mostly
found
in
young
children
and
coinfections
with
other
respiratory
viruses
are
often
found
,
exacerbating
the
efforts
to
link
HBoV
to
specific
symptoms
.

The
purpose
of
this
review
is
to
give
an
overview
of
recent
HBoV
research
,
highlighting
some
recent
findings
.

Programmed
â1
ribosomal
frameshifting
(
PRF
)
and
stop
codon
readthrough
are
two
translational
recoding
mechanisms
utilized
by
some
RNA
viruses
to
express
their
structural
and
enzymatic
proteins
at
a
defined
ratio
.

Efficient
recoding
usually
requires
an
RNA
pseudoknot
located
several
nucleotides
downstream
from
the
recoding
site
.

To
assess
the
strategic
importance
of
the
recoding
pseudoknots
,
we
have
carried
out
a
large
scale
genome-wide
analysis
in
which
we
used
an
in-house
developed
program
to
detect
all
possible
H-type
pseudoknots
within
the
genomic
mRNAs
of
81
animal
viruses
.

Pseudoknots
are
detected
downstream
from
â¼85
%
of
the
recoding
sites
,
including
many
previously
unknown
pseudoknots
.

â¼78
%
of
the
recoding
pseudoknots
are
the
most
stable
pseudoknot
within
the
viral
genomes
.

However
,
they
are
not
as
strong
as
some
designed
pseudoknots
that
exhibit
roadblocking
effect
on
the
translating
ribosome
.

Strong
roadblocking
pseudoknots
are
not
detected
within
the
viral
genomes
.

These
results
indicate
that
the
decoding
pseudoknots
have
evolved
to
possess
optimal
stability
for
efficient
recoding
.

We
also
found
that
the
sequence
at
the
gag-pol
frameshift
junction
of
HIV1
harbors
potential
elaborated
pseudoknots
encompassing
the
frameshift
site
.

A
novel
mechanism
is
proposed
for
possible
involvement
of
the
elaborated
pseudoknots
in
the
HIV1
PRF
event

was
characterized
by

followed
by

assays
.

Pretreatment
of
DGFW
with

abolished
viral
replication
,
indicating
that
DGFW
inhibits
EV71
by
targeting
the
virus
.

GFW
exerts
its
anti-EV71
effects
by
inhibiting
viral
entry
without
producing
cytotoxic
side

thus
provides
a
potential
agent

The

The
sensitivity
of
this

10
2
copies
per
Î¼l
â1
of

.

The
PCLSR
was
conducted
at
65
Â°C
creating
cross-linked
complex
structures
.

The
results
of
PCLSR
were
visualized
using
SYBR

,
gel
electrophoresis
while
the
reaction
progress
was
traced
using

system
that
resulted
in
registration
of
fluorescent

and
melting
peaks
at
85.3
Â°C
.

The
developed
PCLSR
was
examined
using
blood

samples
collected
from
selected
17
ASF
cases
from
infected
wild

.

Further
tests
have
been
also
conducted
using
55
tissue
samples
from
23
outbreaks
and
22
cases
.

These
results
showed
that
PCLSR
might
be
further
used
for
preliminary
and
cost-effective
detection

Cardioviruses
,
including
encephalomyocarditis
virus
(
EMCV
)
and
the
human
Saffold
virus
,
are
small
non-enveloped
viruses
belonging
to
the
Picornaviridae
,
a
large
family
of
positivesense
RNA
[
(
+
)
RNA
]
viruses
.

All
(
+
)
RNA
viruses
remodel
intracellular
membranes
into
unique
structures
for
viral
genome
replication
.

Accumulating
evidence
suggests
that
picornaviruses
from
different
genera
use
different
strategies
to
generate
viral
replication
organelles
(
ROs
)
.

For
instance
,
enteroviruses
(
e.g
.

poliovirus
,
coxsackievirus
,
rhinovirus
)
rely
on
the
Golgi-localized
phosphatidylinositol
4-kinase
III
beta
(
PI4KB
)
,
while
cardioviruses
replicate
independently
of
the
kinase
.

By
which
mechanisms
cardioviruses
develop
their
ROs
is
currently
unknown
.

Here
we
show
that
cardioviruses
manipulate
another
PI4K
,
namely
the
ER-localized
phosphatidylinositol
4-kinase
III
alpha
(
PI4KA
)
,
to
generate
PI4P-enriched
ROs
.

By
siRNA-mediated
knockdown
and
pharmacological
inhibition
,
we
demonstrate
that
PI4KA
is
an
essential
host
factor
for
EMCV
genome
replication
.

We
reveal
that
the
EMCV
nonstructural
protein
3A
interacts
with
and
is
responsible
for
PI4KA
recruitment
to
viral
ROs
.

The
ensuing
phosphatidylinositol
4-phosphate
(
PI4P
)
proved
important
for
the
recruitment
of
oxysterol-binding
protein
(
OSBP
)
,
which
delivers
cholesterol
to
EMCV
ROs
in
a
PI4P-dependent
manner
.

PI4P
lipids
and
cholesterol
are
shown
to
be
required
for
the
global
organization
of
the
ROs
and
for
viral
genome
replication
.

Consistently
,
inhibition
of
OSBP
expression
or
function
efficiently
blocked
EMCV
RNA
replication
.

In
conclusion
,
we
describe
for
the
first
time
a
cellular
pathway
involved
in
the
biogenesis
of
cardiovirus
ROs
.

Remarkably
,
the
same
pathway
was
reported
to
promote

Thus
,
our
results
highlight
the
convergent
recruitment
by
distantly
related
(
+
)
RNA
viruses
of
a
host
lipid-modifying
pathway
underlying
formation
of
viral
replication
sites
.

All

RNA
viruses

)
RNA
viruses
]
replicate
their
viral
genomes
in
tight
association
with
reorganized
membranous
structures
.

Viruses
generate
these
unique
structures
,
often
termed
``
replication
organelles
''
(
ROs
)
,
by
efficiently
manipulating
the
host
lipid
metabolism
.

While
the
molecular
mechanisms
underlying
RO
formation
by
enteroviruses
(
e.g
.

poliovirus
)
of
the
family
Picornaviridae
have
been
extensively
investigated
,
little
is
known
about
other
members
belonging
to
this
large
family
.

This
study
provides
the
first
detailed
insight
into
the
RO
biogenesis
of
encephalomyocarditis
virus
(
EMCV
)
,
a
picornavirus
from
the
genus
Cardiovirus
.

We
reveal
that
EMCV
hijacks
the
lipid
kinase
phosphatidylinositol-4
kinase
IIIÎ±
(
PI4KA
)
to
generate
viral
ROs
enriched
in
phosphatidylinositol
4-phosphate
(
PI4P
)
.

In
EMCV-infected
cells
,
PI4P
lipids
play
an
essential
role
in
virus
replication
by
recruiting
another
cellular
protein
,
oxysterol-binding
protein
(
OSBP
)
,
to
the
ROs
.

OSBP
further
impacts
the
lipid
composition
of
the
RO
membranes
,
by
mediating
the
exchange
of
PI4P
with
cholesterol
.

This
membrane-modification
mechanism
of
EMCV
is
remarkably
similar
to
that
of
the
distantly
related
flavivirus
hepatitis
C
virus
(
HCV
)
,
while
distinct
from
that
of

which
recruit
OSBP
via
another

,
namely

Considerable
interest
has
been
given
to
the
study

viral
protein

which
is
the
key
viral

Despite
intensive
investigation
,
the
role
of
GBF1
in
enterovirus
replication
is
not
yet
elucidated
(
reviewed
in

)
.

Recruitment
of
PI4KB
to
ROs
leads
to
a
significant
local
increase
of
membranes
in
its
enzymatic
product
PI4P
[
15
]
.

This
PI4P-rich
environment
serves
to
further
recruit
other
essential
viral
and
host
factors
to
replication
sites
,
such
as
the
viral
polymerase
3D
pol
,
which
is
able
to
specifically
bind
PI4P
in
vitro
.

Recently
,
we
and
others
revealed
that
PI4P
plays
a
central
role
in
enterovirus
replication
by
recruiting
the
oxysterol-binding
protein
(
OSBP
)
to
ROs
[
17
]
[
18
]
[
19
]
.

In
uninfected
cells
,
OSBP
bridges
the
ER
and
Golgi
membranes
by
binding
to
the
ER
integral
membrane
protein
VAP-A
and
to
PI4P
and
Arf1-GTP
at
the
trans-Golgi
[
20
]
.

Through
its
sterol-binding
domain
,
OSBP
shuttles
cholesterol
from
ER
to
the
Golgi
and
PI4P
from
the
Golgi
to
the
ER
,
thereby
generating
a
lipid
counterflow
at
ER-Golgi
membrane
contact
sites
(
MCSs
)
.

In
enterovirus
infection
,
OSBP
exchanges
PI4P
for
cholesterol
most
likely
at
ER-RO
MCSs
[
18
]
.

The
unique
lipid
and
protein
composition
of
enterovirus
ROs
determines
their
particular
3D
architecture
,
which
consists
of
a
complex
tubulo-vesicular
network
,
as
shown
in
cells
infected
with
PV
and
coxsackievirus
B3
(
CVB3
)
[
21
,
22
]
.

The
lipid
transfer
function
of
OSBP
at
membrane
contact
sites
is
not
only
vital
for
enteroviruses
,
but
also
for
HCV
[

.

HCV
genome
replication
occurs
in
association
with
an
ER-derived
network
of
specialized
membrane
vesicles
called
the
membranous
web
(
MW
)
.

Like
enterovirus
ROs
,
the
HCV
MW
is
enriched
in
PI4P
lipids
and
cholesterol
[

]
[
24
]
[
25
]
.

In
the
case
of
HCV
,
PI4P
are
generated
through
recruitment
and
activation
of
the
ER-localized
enzyme
PI4KA
(
phosphatidylinositol-4-phopshate
kinase
type

isoform
Î±
)
by
the
viral
protein
NS5A
[
24
,

]
.

Thus
far
,
information
regarding
virus-host
interactions
that
govern
the
formation
of
cardiovirus
ROs
remains
scarce
.

In
a
report
by
Zhang
et
al
,
it
was
suggested
that
autophagy
supports
EMCV
replication
[
27
]
.

The
study
showed
that
EMCV
infection
triggered
an
accumulation
of
autophagosome-like
vesicles
in
the
cytoplasm
and
that
EMCV
3A
colocalized
with
the
autophagy
marker
LC3
.

However
,
inhibition
of
autophagy
exerted
only
minor
effects
on
virus
replication
[
27
]
,
which
argues
against
a
strong
implication
of
the
autophagy
pathway
in
cardiovirus
genome
replication
and/or
formation
of
ROs
.

Evidence
for
a
role
of
autophagy
in
virus
replication
also
exists
for
enteroviruses
and
flaviviruses
,
but
rather
related
to
non-lytic
virus
release
or
modulation
of
host
innate
immune
responses
than
viral
genome
replication
[

[

[

.

Based
on
observations
that
cardioviruses
do
not
require
GBF1
or
PI4KB
for
replication
[
32
]
[
33
]
[
34
]
,
it
is
generally
believed
that
cardiovirus
replication
strategies
are
distinct
from
those
of
enteroviruses
.

Here
,
we
set
out
to
elucidate
whether
cardiovirus
replication
depends
on
another
PI4K
isoform
.

By
siRNA-mediated
knockdown
,
we
identified
PI4KA
as
a
key
player
in
the
replication
of
EMCV
.

EMCV
3A
interacts
with
and
recruits
PI4KA
to
ROs
,
which
increases
local
PI4P
synthesis
,
eventually
leading
to
downstream
recruitment
of
OSBP
.

We
show
that
the
cholesterol-PI4P
shuttling
activity
of
OSBP
is
important
for
the
global
distribution
of
the
ROs
and
for
virus
genome
replication
.

Our
data
reveal
that
,
by
exploiting
the
same
cellular
pathway
,
the
cardiovirus
replication
strategy
profoundly
resembles
that
of
the
distantly
related
HCV
and
is
dissimilar
to
those
of
other
characterized
picornaviruses
and
flaviviruses
in
this
critical
aspect
.

Thus
,
the
similarity
between
EMCV
and

is
a
striking
case
of
functional
convergence

also
a
mechanism
of
transcriptional
regulation

.

Considering
the
given
homology
between
eukaryotic

a
similar

Retroviruses
enter
into
host

by
fusion

Retroviral
envelope
glycoprotein

There
are
two
types

Although
entry
of
ecotropic
murine

the
involvement
of
endocytosis
in
cell
fusion
is
unclear

By
fluorescent
microscopic
analysis
of
the
fusion-from-within
,
we
found
that
fragments
of
target
cells
are
internalized
into
Env-expressing
cells
.

Treatment
of
the
Env-expressing
cells
with
an
endocytosis
inhibitor
more
significantly
inhibited
the
cell
fusion
than
that
of
the
target
cells
,
indicating
that
endocytosis
in
Env-expressing
cells
is
required
for
the
cell
fusion
.

The
endocytosis
inhibitor
also
attenuated
the
fusion-from-without
.

Electron

analysis
suggested
that
the
membrane
fusion

in
fusion-from-within
initiates
in
endocytic
membrane
dents
.

This
study
shows
that
two
types
of
the
viral
cell
fusion
both
require
endocytosis
,
and
provides
the
cascade
of
fusion-from-within
.

Insectivorous
bats
are
speculated
to
be
ancestral
hosts
of
Middle-East
respiratory
syndrome
(
MERS
)
coronavirus
(
CoV
)
.

MERS-CoV
causes
disease
in
humans
with
thirty-five
percent
fatality
,
and
has
evolved
proteins
that
counteract
human
antiviral
responses
.

Since
bats
experimentally
infected
with
MERS-CoV
do
not
develop
signs
of
disease
,
we
tested
the
hypothesis
that
MERS-CoV
would
replicate
less
efficiently
in
bat
cells
than
in
human
cells
because
of
its
inability
to
subvert
antiviral
responses
in
bat
cells
.

We
infected
human
and
bat
(
Eptesicus
fuscus
)
cells
with
MERS-CoV
and
observed
that
the
virus
grew
to
higher
titers
in
human
cells
.

MERS-CoV
also
effectively
suppressed
the
antiviral
interferon
beta
(
IFNÎ²
)
response
in
human
cells
,
unlike
in
bat
cells
.

To
determine
if
IRF3
,
a
critical
mediator
of
the
interferon
response
,
also
regulated
the
response
in
bats
,
we
examined
the
response
of
IRF3
to
poly
(
I
:
C
)
,
a
synthetic
analogue
of
viral
double-stranded
RNA
.

We
observed
that
bat
IRF3
responded
to
poly
(
I
:
C
)
by
nuclear
translocation
and
post-translational
modifications
,
hallmarks
of
IRF3
activation
.

Suppression
of
IRF3
by
small-interfering
RNA
(
siRNA
)
demonstrated
that
IRF3
was
critical
for
poly
(
I
:
C
)
and
MERS-CoV
induced
induction
of
IFNÎ²
in
bat
cells
.

Our
study
demonstrates
that
innate
antiviral
signaling
in
E.
fuscus
bat
cells
is
resistant
to
MERS-CoV-mediated
subversion
.

A
new
cell
line
derived
from
the
kidney
of
European
eel
,
Anguilla
anguilla
,
has
been
established
and
characterized
.

This
cell
line
,
designated
as

,
has
been
maintained
in
Leibovitz

supplemented
with
10
%
fetal
bovine
serum
for
over
24
months
,
and
subcultured
more
than
60
times
.

This
cell
line
consists
predominantly
of
fibroblast-like
cells
,
and
can
grow
at
15-37Â°C
under
an
optimum
temperature
of
26Â°C
.

The
origin
of
this
cell
line
was
confirmed
by
polymerase
chain
reaction
(
PCR
)
amplification
and
18s
recombinant
(
r
)
RNA
sequencing
.

The
chromosome
analysis
of
EK
cells
at
passage
58
revealed
an
ananeuploid
karyotype
.

The
EK
cells
were
successfully
transfected
with
the
Pegfp-N1
plasmid
,
suggesting
its
potential
in
genetic
studies
.

The
susceptibility
test
showed
a
significant
cytopathic
effect
(
CPE
)
in
EK
cells
for
Rana
grylio
virus
,
and
the
viral
replication
was
evidenced
with
quantitative
real-time
PCR
(
qRT-PCR
)
assay
.

After
poly
(
I
:
C
)
stimulation
,
the
expression
of
the
immune-related
molecules
including
interferon
regulatory
factor-3
(
irf3
)
,
interferon
regulatory
factor-7
(
irf7
)
and
cytochrome
P450
(
CYP450
)
were
significantly
upregulated
in
EK
cells
,
while
the
expression
of
transforming
growth
factor
(
TGF-Î²
)
was
downregulated
.

These
results
suggested
the
potential
of
EK

as
a
model
in
gene

(
MDG

)
:
to
reduce
under-5-year
mortality
rates
by
two-thirds
by
the
year
2015
.

Unfortunately
,
only
27
of
138
developing
countries
are
expected
to
achieve
MDG

.

The
majority
of
childhood
deaths
in
these
settings
result
from
reversible
causes
,
and
developing
effective
pediatric
emergency
and
critical
care
services
could
substantially
reduce
this
mortality
.

The
Ebola
outbreak
highlighted
the
fragility
of
health
care
systems
in
resource-limited
settings
and
emphasized
the
urgent
need
for
a
paradigm
shift
in
the
global
approach
to
healthcare
delivery
related
to
critical
illness
.

This
review
provides
an
overview
of
pediatric
critical
care
in
resource-limited
settings
and
outlines
strategies
to
address
challenges
specific
to
these
areas
.

Implementation
of
these
tools
has
the
potential
to
move
us
toward
delivery
of
an
adequate
standard
of
critical
care
for
all
children
globally
,
and
ultimately
decrease
global

mortality
in

The
objective
of
this
study
was
to
screen
for
antigens
of
the
hepatitis
C
virus
(
HCV
)
to
establish
a
new
double
antibody
sandwich-lateral
flow
immunoassay
(
DAS-LFIA
)
method
for
testing
the
presence
of
anti-HCV
antibodies
in
human
serum
or
plasma
.

A
series
of
different
recombinant
HCV
proteins
in
Escherichia
coli
cells
were
constructed
,
expressed
,
purified
and
the
new
DAS-LFIA
strip
was
developed
.

The
sensitivity
and
specificity
of
new
the
DAS-LFIA
strip
were
evaluated
by
detecting
23
HCV-positive
sera
,
a
set
of
quality
control
references
for
anti-HCV
detection
that
contain
known
amounts
of
anti-HCV
antibodies
,
and
8
HCV-negative
sera
.

A
total
of
300
clinical
serum
samples
was
examined
by
both
the
new
DAS-LFIA
strip
and
enzyme-linked
immunosorbent
assay
(
ELISA
)
.

Data
were
analyzed
using
SPSS
11.5
software
.

The
sensitivity
and
specificity
of
the
new
DAS-LFIA
strip
were
100
%
.

The
lowest
test
line
of
the
HCV
DAS-LFIA
strips
was
2
NCU/ml
.

Additionally
,
the
concordance
between
the
new
DAS-LFIA
strip
and
ELISA
methods
was
94.33
%
.

In
conclusion
,
our
new
testing
method
is
rapid
,
simple
,
sensitive
and
specifically
detects
the
presence
of
anti-HCV
antibodies
in
human
serum
or
plasma
.

Therefore
,
it
may
be
used
for
monitoring
HCV
.

It
was
only
relatively
recently
discovered
that
nucleic
acids
participate
in
a
variety
of
biological
functions
,
besides
the
storage
and
transmission
of
genetic
information
.

Quite
apart
from
the
nucleotide
sequence
,
it
is
now
clear
that
the
structure
of
a
nucleic
acid
plays
an
essential
role
in
its
functionality
,
enabling
catalysis
and
specific
binding
reactions
.

In
vitro
selection
and
evolution
strategies
have
been
extremely
useful
in
the
analysis
of
functional
RNA
and
DNA
molecules
,
helping
to
expand
our
knowledge
of
their
functional
repertoire
and
to
identify
and
optimize
DNA
and
RNA
molecules
with
potential
therapeutic
and
diagnostic
applications
.

The
great
progress
made
in
this
field
has
prompted
the
development
of
ex
vivo
methods
for
selecting
functional
nucleic
acids
in
the
cellular
environment
.

This
review
summarizes
the
most
important
and
most
recent
applications
of
in
vitro
and
ex
vivo
selection
strategies
aimed
at
exploring
the
therapeutic
potential
of
nucleic
acids
.

Background
:
In
response
to
an
unexpected
long
cold
spell
in
February
1996
which
killed
more
than
100
older
adults
(
mostly
living
alone
)
in
Hong
Kong
,
the
Hong
Kong
Senior
Citizen
Home
Safety
Association
established
a
Personal
Emergency
Link
Service
to
provide
emergency
contact
to
the
older
adults
,
which
uses
a
telephone
system
to
render
emergency
relief
and
total
care
service
around
the
clock
.

To
facilitate
the
dynamic
and
efficient
allocation
of
service
resources
,
it
is
crucial
to
understand
the
factors
linked
with
use
of
the
services
and
number
of
hospital
admissions
arising
from
PE
link
service
.

Methods
:
We
initially
use
the
Poisson
generalized
linear
model
(
GLM
)
with
polynomial
effect
functions
of
relevant
covariates
.

If
the
time
series
of
residuals
from
fitting
the
Poisson
GLM
reveals
significant
serial
correlation
,
a
Poisson
generalized
linear
autoregressive
moving
average
(
GLARMA
)
model
is
refitted
to
the
data
to
account
for
the
auto-correlation
among
the
time
series
of
daily
call
numbers
.

If
the
data
is
overdispersed
relative
to
the
best
fitting
Poisson
GLARMA
model
,
then
the
negative
binomial
GLARMA
model
is
refitted
to
account
for
any
overdispersion
.

In
all
the
models
,
dummy
variables
for
weekdays
and
months
are
included
to
account
for
any
cyclic
trends
due
weekday
effect
or
month
of
the
year
effect
.

The
secular
time
trend
is
modeled
by
a
polynomial
function
of
calendar
time
over
the
study
period
.

Finally
any
critical
temperatures
are
identified
by
visually
inspecting
the
graph
of
the
effect
function
of
temperature
.

Results
:
The
weekday
and
month
effects
are
both
significant
with
Monday
seeing
more
PE
Link
calls
than
Sunday
and
June
seeing
less
than
January
.

Temperature
has
significant
effect
on
the
PE
Link
call
rate
with
the
effect
highly
nonlinear
.

A
critical
temperature
,
below
which
excessive
increase
in
PE
link
calls
that
lead
to
hospital
admissions
,
is
identified
to
be
around
15Â°C
.

Conclusion
:
Identifying
a
threshold
temperature
which
generates
an
excessive
increase
in
the
expected
number
of
PE
Link
calls
would
be
useful
in
service
provision
planning
and
support
for
elderly
in
need
of
hospital
admission
.

Avian
infectious
bronchitis
virus
(
IBV
)
causes
considerable
economic
losses
in
the
poultry
industry
worldwide
,
including
Taiwan
.

IBV
is
among
the
most
important
pathogens
in
chickens
,
and
it
spreads
rapidly
among
flocks
.

In
addition
to
dozens
of
known
serotypes
,
new
viral
variants
have
emerged
due
to
the
viral
evolution
and
antigenic
variation
in
IBVs
.

Therefore
,
the
development
of
a
sensitive
,
specific
,
and
easily
performed
assay
is
crucial
for
the
rapid
detection
and
surveillance
of
IBV
infections
.

A
rapid
and
simple
immunochromatographic
strip
(
ICS
)
was
developed
in
this
study
by
employing
monoclonal
antibodies
against
spike
and
nucleocapsid
proteins
of
IBV
as
the
tracer
and
the
capture
antibody
.

The
ICS
showed
high
specificity
in
detecting
IBV
antigens
,
including
several
IBV
genotypes
and
novel
variants
,
as
opposed
to
three
other
common
avian
respiratory
viruses
.

The
detection
limit
of
the
strip
reached
10
4.4
50
%
embryo-infective
dose
.

Moreover
,
in
the
experimental
chicken
model
,
the
strip
test
demonstrated
consistency
in
detecting
IBV
with
RT-PCR
gene
detection
.

Taken
together
,
this
antigen
detection
strip
has
the
potential
to
serve
as
an
on-farm
rapid
test
for
IBV
;
therefore
,
it
may
facilitate
surveillance
and
control
of
the
disease
.

Background
:
Acute
respiratory
infections
(
ARIs
)
are
common
in
children
and
mostly
caused
by
viruses
,
but
the
significance
of
the
detection
of
multiple
viruses
in
ARIs
is
unclear
.

This
study
investigated
14
respiratory
viruses
in
ARIs
among
children
and
associated
meteorological
factors
in
Shantou
,

China
.

Methods
:
Paired
nasal/throat-flocked

walk-in
clinics
in
a
tertiary
hospital
between
December
2010
and
November
2011
,
were
examined
for

Results
:
We
identified
at
least
one
virus
in
82.3
%
(
884/1,074
)
and
multiple
viruses
in
38.6
%
(
415/1,074
)
of
patients
.

EV
and
HRV
were
the
most
frequently
detected
single
viruses
(
42.3
%
,
374/884
and
39.9
%
,
353/884
respectively
)
and
co-detected
pair
(
23.1
%
,
96/415
)
.

Overlapping
seasonal
trends
of
viruses
were
recorded
over
the
year
,
with
dual
peaks
for
EV
and
single
peaks
for
the
others
.

By
logistic
regression
analysis
,
EV
was
positively
associated
with
the
average
temperature
and
humidity
,
hCoV
,
and
PIV4
,
but
negatively
with
HRV
,
PIV3
,
and
hBoV
.

HRV
was
inversely
associated
with
EV
and
PIV3
.

Conclusions
:
This
study
reports
high
viral
detection
and
co-detection
rates
in
pediatric
ARI
cases
mainly
due
to
EV
and
HRV
.

Many
viruses
circulated
throughout
the

with
similar
seasonal
trends
in
association
with
temperature
,
humidity
,
and
wind
velocity
.

Statistically
significant
associations
were
present
among
the
viruses
.

Understanding
the
polyviral
etiology
and
viral
interactions
in
the
cases
with
multiple
viruses
warrants
further
studies
.

Background
:
Persistent
infection
of
the
Japanese
Encephalitis
Virus
(
JEV
)
has
been
reported
in
clinical
cases
,
experimental
animals
,
and
various
cell
culture
systems
.

We
previously
reported
the
establishment
of
spontaneous
JEV
persistent
infection
,
assisted
by
defective
interfering
particle
accumulation
and/or
attenuated
helper
viruses
,
in
BHK-21
cells
devoid
of
virus-induced
apoptosis
,
cBS6-2
and
cBS6-3
.

However
,
cell-specific
factors
may
play
important
roles
in
controlling
JEV
replication
and
have
never
been
assessed
for
this
specific
phenomenon
.

Recent
evidence
suggests
that
viruses
have
evolved
various
mechanisms
to
cope
with
endoplasmic
reticulum
stress
signaling
pathways
for
their
efficient
amplification
and
transmission
,
including
the
unfolded
protein
response
(
UPR
)
.

Results
:
To
identify
the
host
cell
factors
that
affect
JEV
persistence
,
we
investigated
the
expression
of
essential
UPR
factors
in
cBS6-2
and
cBS6-3
cells
.

Of
the
selected
UPR
factors
tested
,
the
most
noticeable
deviations
from
those
of
the
normal
BHK-21
cells
with
JEV
acute
infection
were
as
follows
:
the
suppression
of
C/EBP
homologous
binding
protein
(
CHOP
)
and
the
constant
up-regulation
of
immunoglobulin
binding
protein
(
BiP
)
expression
in
cBS6-2
and
cBS6-3
cells
.

In
JEV
acute
infection
on
normal
BHK-21
cells
,
silencing
CHOP
expression
through
specific
siRNA
blocked
cell
death
almost
completely
.

Meanwhile
,
depletion
of
BiP
by
specific
siRNA
unlocked
CHOP
expression
in
cBS6-2
and
cBS6-3
cells
,
resulting
in
massive
cell
death
.

Fulminant
apoptotic
cell
death
for
both
cell
clones
on
tunicamycin
treatment
revealed
that
the
JEV
persistently
infected
cells
still
contained
functional
arms
for
cell
fate
decisions
.

Conclusions
:
BHK-21
cells
with
JEV
persistent
infection
strive
against
virus-induced
apoptosis
through
constant
up-regulation
of
BiP
expression
,
resulting
in
the
complete
depletion
of
CHOP
even
with
apparent
virus
amplification
in
the
cells
.

Accordingly
,
the
attenuation
of
virus
replication
as
well
as
the
modifications
to
cell
metabolism
could
be
additional
factors
contributing
to
the
development
of
JEV
persistent
infection
in
mammalian
cells
.

Herpesviruses
are
highly
prevalent
viruses
associated
with
numerous
pathologies
both
in
animal
and
human
populations
.

Until
now
,
most
of
the
strategies
used
to
prevent
or
to
cure
these
infections
have
been
unsuccessful
because
these
viruses
have
developed
numerous
immune
evasion
mechanisms
.

Therefore
,
a
better
understanding
of
their
complex
lifecycle
is
needed
.

In
particular
,
while
the
genome
of
numerous
herpesviruses
has
been
sequenced
,
the
exact
composition
of
virions
remains
unknown
for
most
of
them
.

Mass
spectrometry
has
recently
emerged
as
a
central
method
and
has
permitted
fundamental
discoveries
in
virology
.

Here
,
we
review
mass
spectrometry-based
approaches
that
have
recently
allowed
a
better
understanding
of
the
composition
of
the
herpesvirus
virion
.

In
particular
,
we
describe
strategies
commonly
used
for
proper
sample
preparation
and
fractionation
to
allow
protein
localization
inside
the
particle
but
also
to
avoid
contamination
by
nonstructural
proteins
.

A
collection
of
other
important
data
regarding
post-translational
modifications
or
the
relative
abundance
of
structural
proteins
is
also
described
.

This
review
also
discusses
the
poorly
studied
importance
of
host
proteins
in
herpesvirus
structural
proteins
and
the
necessity
to
develop
a
quantitative
workflow
to
better
understand
the
dynamics
of
the
structural
proteome
.

In
the
future
,
we
hope
that
this
collaborative
effort
will
assist
in
the
development
of
new
strategies
to
fight
these
infections

a
description
of
the

composition
both
in

is
also
of
major
importance
for
a
better
characterization
of
infectious
processes
.

In

characterization
of
the

of
complex
enveloped
viruses
,
such
as
poxviruses
and
herpesviruses
,
is
of
major
importance
to
better
understand
their
life
cycle
.

Knowledge
of
the
composition
of
the
virion
but
also
of
the
distribution
of
proteins
in
the
capsid
,

,
and
envelope
are
essential
to

have
since
been

to
characterize
the
structural

of
the

of
herpesviruses
.

It
has
been
demonstrated
that
knowledge
of
the
composition
of
virions
can
be
highly
useful
for
the

This
review
summarizes
the
different
aspects
of
the
study
of
the
structural
proteome
focusing
on
the
Herpesviridae
family
,
notably
the
different
proteomic
workflow
that
has
been
successfully
used
and
the
importance
of
sample
preparation
.

The
review
also
discusses
the
status
of
host
cellular
proteins
found
in
the
virion
and
the
interest
in
acquiring
quantitative
data
.

Background
:
Avian
infectious
bronchitis
virus
(
IBV
)
is
a
major
respiratory
disease-causing
agent
in
birds
that
leads
to
significant
losses
.

Dendritic
cells
(
DCs
)
are
specialised
cells
responsible
for
sampling
antigens
and
presenting
them
to
T
cells
,
which
also
play
an
essential
role
in
recognising
and
neutralising
viruses
.

Recent
studies
have
suggested
that
non-coding
RNAs
may
regulate
the
functional
program
of
DCs
.

Expression
of
host
non-coding
RNAs
changes
markedly
during
infectious
bronchitis
virus
infection
,
but
their
role
in
regulating
host
immune
function
has
not
been
explored
.

Here
,
microarrays
of
mRNAs
,
miRNAs
,
and
lncRNAs
were
globally
performed
to
analyse
how
avian
DCs
respond
to
IBV
.

Results
:
First
,
we
found
that
IBV
stimulation
did
not
enhance
the
maturation
ability
of
avian
DCs
.

Interestingly
,
inactivated
IBV
was
better
able
than
IBV
to
induce
DC
maturation
and
activate
lymphocytes
.

We
identified
1093
up-regulated
and
845
down-regulated
mRNAs
in
IBV-infected
avian
DCs
.

Gene
Ontology
analysis
suggested
that
cellular
macromolecule
and
protein
location
(
GO-BP
)
and
transcription
factor
binding
(
GO-MF
)
were
abundant
in
IBV-stimulated
avian
DCs
.

Meanwhile
,
pathway
analysis
indicated
that
the
oxidative
phosphorylation
and
leukocyte
transendothelial
migration
signalling
pathways
might
be
activated
in
the
IBV
group
.

Moreover
,
alteration
of
microRNAs
(
miRNAs
)
and
long
non-coding
RNAs
(
lncRNAs
)
was
detected
in
IBV-stimulated
avian
DCs
.

In
total
,
19
significantly
altered
(
7
up
and
12
down
)
miRNAs
and
101
(
75
up
and
26
down
)
lncRNAs
were
identified
in
the
IBV-treated
group
.

Further
analysis
showed
that
the
actin
cytoskeleton
and
MAPK
signal
pathway
were
related
to
the
target
genes
of
IBV-stimulated
miRNAs
.

Finally
,
our
study
identified
2
TF-microRNA
and
53
TF-microRNA-mRNA
interactions
involving
1
TF
,
2
miRNAs
,
and
53
mRNAs
in
IBV-stimulated
avian
DCs
.

Conclusions
:
Our
research
suggests
a
new
mechanism
to
explain
why
IBV
actively
blocks
innate
responses
needed
for
inducing
immune
gene
expression
and
also
provides
insight
into
the
pathogenic
mechanisms
of
avian
IBV
.

Many
natural
product-derived
lectins
such
as
the
red
algal
lectin
griffithsin
(
GRFT
)
have
potent
in
vitro
activity
against
viruses
that
display
dense
clusters
of
oligomannose
N-linked
glycans
(
NLG
)
on
their
surface
envelope
glycoproteins
.

However
,
since
oligomannose
NLG
are
also
found
on
some
host
proteins
it
is
possible
that
treatment
with
antiviral
lectins
may
trigger
undesirable
side
effects
.

For
other
antiviral
lectins
such
as
concanavalin
A
,
banana
lectin
and
cyanovirin-N
(
CV-N
)
,
interactions
between
the
lectin
and
as
yet
undescribed
cellular
moieties
have
been
reported
to
induce
undesirable
side
effects
including
secretion
of
inflammatory
cytokines
and
activation
of
host
T-cells
.

We
show
that
GRFT
,
unlike
CV-N
,
binds
the
surface
of
human
epithelial
and
peripheral
blood
mononuclear
cells
(
PBMC
)
through
an
exclusively
oligosaccharidedependent
interaction
.

In
contrast
to
several
other
antiviral
lectins
however
,
GRFT
treatment
induces
only
minimal
changes
in
secretion
of
inflammatory
cytokines
and
chemokines
by
epithelial
cells
or
human
PBMC
,
has
no
measureable
effect
on
cell
viability
and
does
not
significantly
upregulate
markers
of
T-cell
activation
.

In
addition
,
GRFT
appears
to
retain
antiviral
activity
once
bound
to
the
surface
of
PBMC
.

Finally
,
RNA
microarray
studies
show
that
,
while
CV-N
and
ConA
regulate
expression
of
a
multitude
of
cellular
genes
,
GRFT
treatment
effects
only
minimal
alterations
in
the
gene
expression
profile
of
a
human
ectocervical
cell
line
.

These
studies
indicate
that
GRFT
has
an
outstanding
safety
profile
with
little
evidence
of
induced
toxicity
,
T-cell
activation
or
deleterious
immunological
consequence
,
unique
attributes
for
a

Mutation
of
mevalonate
kinase
(
MVK
)
is
thought
to
account
for
most
cases
of
hyperimmunoglobulinemia
D
syndrome
(
HIDS
)
with
recurrent
fever
.

However
,
its
mechanism
and
the
relationship
between
elevated
serum
immunoglobulin
D
(
IgD
)
and
the
clinical
features
of
HIDS
are
unclear
.

In
this
study
,
we
generated
by
fusion
PCR
a
vector
to
express
high
levels
of
chimeric
secretory
IgD
(
csIgD
)
specifically
in
the
liver
.

We
then
generated
seven
founder
lines
of
transgenic
mice
by
co-microinjection
,
and
verified
them
using
genomic
PCR
and
Southern
blotting
.

We
detected
the
expression
of
csIgD
by
reverse
transcription
PCR
,
quantitative
PCR
,
western
blotting
,
and
enzyme-linked
immunosorbent
assays
.

We
demonstrated
that
csIgD
could
be
specifically
and
stably
expressed
in
the
liver
.

We
used
flow
cytometry
to
show
that
overexpression
of
csIgD
in
the
bone
marrow
and
spleen
cells
had
no
effect
on
B
cell
development
.

Morphologic
and
anatomical
observation
of
the
transgenic
mice
revealed
skin
damage
,
hepatosplenomegaly
,
and
nephromegaly
in
some
transgenic
mice
;
in
these
mice
,
pathological
sections
showed
high
levels
of
cell
necrosis
and
protein-like
sediments
in
the
liver
,

,
and
kidney
.

We
demonstrated
that
the
genomic
insertion
sites
of
the
transgenes
did
not
disrupt
the
MVK
gene

Live
attenuated
influenza
vaccines
(
LAIV
)
have
prevented
morbidity
and
mortality
associated
with
influenza
viral
infections
for
many
years
and
represent
the
best
therapeutic
option
to
protect
against
influenza
viral
infections
in
humans
.

However
,
the
development
of
LAIV
has
traditionally
relied
on
empirical
methods
,
such
as
the
adaptation
of
viruses
to
replicate
at
low
temperatures
.

These
approaches
require
an
extensive
investment
of
time
and
resources
before
identifying
potential
vaccine
candidates
that
can
be
safely
implemented
as
LAIV
to
protect
humans
.

In
addition
,
the
mechanism
of
attenuation
of
these
vaccines
is
poorly
understood
in
some
cases
.

Importantly
,
LAIV
are
more
efficacious
than
inactivated
vaccines
because
their
ability
to
mount
efficient
innate
and
adaptive
humoral
and
cellular
immune
responses
.

Therefore
,
the
design
of
potential
LAIV
based
on
known
properties
of
viral
proteins
appears
to
be
a
highly
appropriate
option
for
the
treatment
of
influenza
viral
infections
.

For
that
,
the
viral
RNA
synthesis
machinery
has
been
a
research
focus
to
identify
key
amino
acid
substitutions
that
can
lead
to
viral
attenuation
and
their
use
in
safe
,
immunogenic
,
and
protective
LAIV
.

In
this
review
,
we
discuss
the
potential
to
manipulate
the
influenza
viral
RNA-dependent
RNA
polymerase
(
RdRp
)
complex
to
generate
attenuated
forms
of
the
virus
that
can
be
used
as
LAIV
for
the
treatment
of
influenza
viral
infections
,
one
of
the
current
and
most
effective
prophylactic
options
for
the
control
of
influenza
in
humans
.

The
remaining
prophylactic
option
is
the
live
attenuated
influenza
vaccine
(
LAIV
)
,
which
is
associated
with
broader
responses
and
protection
by
the
induction
of
both
innate
and
humoral
B-and
T-cell
adaptive
immune
responses
.

In
addition
,
its
administration
mimics
the
usual
route
of
influenza
virus
infection
that
has
been
shown
to
provide
more
efficient
cross-reactive
cellular-mediated
protection
against
heterologous
influenza
viruses
,
important
in
cases
where
the
vaccine
and
circulating
strains
do
not
match

The
advances
in
understanding
complex
networks
have
generated
increasing
interest
in
dynamical
processes
occurring
on
them
.

Pattern
formation
in
activator-inhibitor
systems
has
been
studied
in
networks
,
revealing
differences
from
the
classical
continuous
media
.

Here
we
study
pattern
formation
in
a
new
framework
,
namely
multiplex
networks
.

These
are
systems
where
activator
and
inhibitor
species
occupy
separate
nodes
in
different
layers
.

Species
react
across
layers
but
diffuse
only
within
their
own
layer
of
distinct
network
topology
.

This
multiplicity
generates
heterogeneous
patterns
with
significant
differences
from
those
observed
in
single-layer
networks
.

Remarkably
,
diffusion-induced
instability
can
occur
even
if
the
two
species
have
the
same
mobility
rates
;
condition
which
can
never
destabilize
single-layer
networks
.

The
instability
condition
is
revealed
using
perturbation
theory
and
expressed
by
a
combination
of
degrees
in
the
different
layers
.

Our
theory
demonstrates
that
the
existence
of
such
topology-driven
instabilities
is
generic
in
multiplex
networks
,
providing
a
new
mechanism
of
pattern
formation
.

Distributed
active
media
support
a
variety
of
self-organized
patterns
,
such
as
stationary
and
oscillatory
structures
,
spiral
waves
,
and
turbulence
1-3
.

Such
media
are
often
described
by
reaction-diffusion
systems
and
consist
of
elements
obeying
an
activator-inhibitor
dynamics
with
local
coupling
.

In
his
pioneering
paper
1
,
Turing
showed
that
a
uniform
steady
state
can
be
spontaneously
destabilized
,
leading
to
a
spontaneous
formation
of
a
periodic
spatial
pattern
,
when
reacting
species
diffuse
with
different
mobilities
.

It
was
later
proposed
by
Gierer
and
Meinhardt
4
that
an
activator-inhibitor
chemical
reaction
is
a
typical
example
achieving
Turing
's
scenario
.

Turing
instability
is
a
classical
mechanism
of
self-organization
far
from
equilibrium
,
and
plays
an
important
role
in
biological
morphogenesis
.

It
has
been
extensively
studied
in
biological
4-6
and
chemical
7
systems
,
as
well
as
real
ecosystems
8
,
9
.

The
active
elements
can
also
be
coupled
in
more
complicated
ways
,
forming
complex
networks
10,11
.

Complex
networks
are
ubiquitous
in
nature
12
;
two
typical
examples
are
epidemics
spreading
over
transportation
systems
13
and
ecological
systems
where
distinct
habitats
communicate
through
dispersal
connections

Theoretical
studies
of
reaction-diffusion
processes
on
complex
networks
have
recently
attracted
much
attention
12,18-21
.

Othmer
and
Scriven
22,23
developed
the
general
mathematical
framework
to
describe
Turing
instability
in
networks
,
and
provided
several
examples
of
small
regular
lattices
.

Afterwards
,
Turing
patterns
were
explored
in
small
networks
of
chemical
reactors
24,25
.

More
recent
work
in
this
area
includes
detailed
studies
of
Turing
bifurcation
and
related
hysteresis
phenomena
in
large
complex
networks
26
,
27
,
and
oscillatory
Turing
patterns
in
multi-species
ecological
networks
28
.

In
nature
,
the
active
elements
of
a
system
can
communicate
through
different
types
of
pathways
with
different
architecture
.

Such
a
system
with
multiple
types
of
links
can
be
represented
as
a
special
type
of
complex
network
called
a
multiplex
network
29
.

Recent
theoretical
studies
have
shown
that
the
spectral
properties
of
multiplex
networks
are
significantly
different
from
those
of
single-layer
networks
29-33
,
and
that
these
differences
affect
the
diffusion
processes
occurring
on
the
network
30,31
.

Consequently
,
the
emergent
dynamics
can
exhibit
new
kinds
of
patterns
.

Examples
include
the
breathing
synchronization
of
cross-connected
phase
oscillators
34
and
the
emergence
of
a
metacritical
point
in
epidemic

Autophagy
is
an
evolutionarily
conserved
cellular
process
in
which
intracellular
components
are
eliminated
via
lysosomal
degradation
to
supply
nutrients
for
organelle

and
metabolic
homeostasis
.

Flavivirus
infections
underlie
multiple
human
diseases
and
thus
exert
an
immense
burden
on
public
health
worldwide
.

Mounting
evidence
indicates
that
host
autophagy
is
subverted
to
modulate
the
life
cycles
of
flaviviruses
,
such
as
hepatitis
C
virus
,
dengue
virus
,
Japanese
encephalitis
virus
,
West
Nile
virus
and
Zika
virus
.

The
diverse
interplay
between
autophagy
and
flavivirus
infection
not
only
regulates
viral
growth
in
host
cells
but
also
counteracts
host
stress
responses
induced
by
viral
infection
.

In
this
review
,
we
summarize
the
current
knowledge
on
the
role
of
autophagy
in
the
flavivirus
life
cycle
.

We
also
discuss
the
impacts
of
virus-induced
autophagy
on
the
pathogeneses
of
flavivirus-associated
diseases
and
the
potential
use
of
autophagy
as
a
therapeutic
target
for
curing
flavivirus
infections
and
related
human
diseases

Models
of
host-microbe
dynamics
typically
assume
a
single-host
population
infected
by
a
single
pathogen
.

In
reality
,
many
hosts
form
multi-species
aggregations
and
may
be
infected
with
an
assemblage
of
pathogens
.

We
used
a
meta-transcriptomic
approach
to
characterize
the
viromes
of
nine
avian
species
in
the
Anseriformes
(
ducks
)
and
Charadriiformes
(
shorebirds
)
.

This
revealed
the
presence
of
27
viral
species
,
of
which
24
were
novel
,
including
double-stranded
RNA
viruses
(
Picobirnaviridae
and
Reoviridae
)
,
single-stranded

,

,
a

DNA
virus
(
Hepadnaviridae
)
,
and
a
single-stranded
DNA
virus
(
Parvoviridae
)
.

These
viruses
comprise
multihost
generalist
viruses
and
those
that
are
host-specific
,
indicative
of
both
virome
connectivity
(
host
sharing
)
and
heterogeneity
(
host
specificity
)
.

Virome
connectivity
was
apparent
in
two
well
described
multi-host
virus
species
-avian
coronavirus
and
influenza
A
virus-and
a
novel
Rotavirus
species
that
were
shared
among
some
Anseriform
species
,
while
virome
heterogeneity
was
reflected
in
the
absence
of
viruses
shared
between
Anseriformes
and
Charadriiformes
,
as
well
as
differences
in
viral
abundance
and
alpha
diversity
among
species
.

Overall
,
we
demonstrate
complex
virome
structures
across
host
species
that
co-exist
in
multi-species
aggregations
.

Formal
,
quantitative
approaches
are

about
the

disease
outbreak
,
how
the
disease
will
spread
,
and
how
to
control
it
.

Several
wellestablished
methodologies
are
available
,
including
risk

analysis
,

Even
so
,
predictive

is
very
much
the

drive
research

may
be
at

epidemiology
and
control
of
human
and
animal
diseases
such
as
AIDS
,
influenza
,
foot-and-mouth
disease
and
BSE
,
attention
needs
to
be
paid
to
developing
a
more
holistic
framework
that
captures
the
role
of
the
underlying
drivers
of
disease
risks
,
from
demography
and
behaviour
to
land
use
and
climate
change
.

At
the
same
time
,
there
is
still
considerable
room
for
improvement
in
how
quantitative
analyses
and
their
outputs
are
communicated
to
policy
makers
and
other
stakeholders
.

A
starting
point
would
be
generally
accepted
guidelines
for
'good
practice
'
for
the
development
and
the
use
of
predictive
models
.

Background
:
2'-5
'
oligoadenylate
synthetases
(
OAS
)
are
interferon
inducible
enzymes
that
polymerizes
ATP
to
2'-5'-linked
oligomers
of
adenylate
(
2-5As
)
.

As
part
of
the
innate
immune
response
,
these
enzymes
are
activated
by
viral
double
stranded
RNA
or
mRNAs
with
significant
double
stranded
structure
.

The
2-5As
in
turn
activate
RNaseL
that
degrade
single
stranded
RNAs
.

Three
distinct
forms
of
OAS
exist
in
human
cells
(
OAS1
,
2
and
3
)
with
each
form
having
multiple
spliced
variants
.

The
OAS
enzymes
and
their
spliced
variants
have
different
enzyme
activities
.

OAS
enzymes
also
play
a
significant
role
in
regulating
multiple
cellular
processes
such
as
proliferation
and
apoptosis
.

Moreover
,
Single
nucleotide
polymorphisms
that
alter
OAS
activity
are
also
associated
with
viral
infection
,
diabetes
and
cancer
.

Thus
detection
of
OAS
enzyme
activity
with
a
simple
spectrophotometric
method
in
cells
will
be
important
in
clinical
research
.

Results
:
Here
we
propose
a
modified
coupled
spectrophotometric
assay
to
detect
2-5
oligoadenylate
synthetase
(
OAS
)
enzyme
activity
in
prostate
cell
lines
as
a
model
system
.

The
OAS
enzyme
from
prostate
cancer
cell
lysates
was
purified
using
Polyinosinic
:
polycytidylic
acid
(
poly
I
:
C
)
bound
activated
sepharose
beads
.

The
activated
OAS
enzyme
eluted
from
Sepharose
beads
showed
expression
of
p46
isoform
of
OAS1
,
generally
considered
the
most
abundant
OAS
isoform
in
elutes
from
DU14
cell
line
but
not
in
other
prostate
cell
line
.

In
this
assay
the
phosphates
generated
by
the
OAS
enzymatic
reaction
is
coupled
with
conversion
of
the
substrate
2-amino-6mercapto-7-methylpurine
ribonucleoside
(
methylthioguanosine
,
a
guanosine
analogue
;
MESG
)
to
a
purine
base
product
,
2-amino-6-mercapto-7-methylpurine
and
ribose1-phosphate
via
a
catalyst
purine
nucleoside
phosphorylase
(
phosphorylase
)
using
a
commercially
available
pyrophosphate
kit
.

The
absorbance
of
the
purine
base
product
is
measured
at
360
nm
.

The
higher
levels
of
phosphates
detected
in
DU145
cell
line
indicates
more
activity
of
OAS
in
this
prostate
cancer
cell
line
.

Conclusion
:
The
modified
simple
method
detected
OAS
enzyme
activity
with
sensitivity
and
specificity
,
which
could
help
in
detection
of
OAS
enzymes
avoiding
the
laborious
and
radioactive
methods
.

Background
:
Despite
the
long-anticipated
possibility
of
putting
sequence
alignment
on
the
same
footing
as
statistical
phylogenetics
,
theorists
have
struggled
to
develop
time-dependent
evolutionary
models
for
indels
that
are
as
tractable
as
the
analogous
models
for
substitution
events
.

on
the
calculation
of
time-dependent

,
and
current
approaches
for
extending
these
approaches
from
ancestor-descendant
pairs
to
phylogenetic
trees
.

Conclusions
:
While
approximations
that
use
finite-state
machines
(
Pair
HMMs
and
transducers
)
currently
represent
the
most
practical
approach
to
problems
such
as
sequence
alignment
and
phylogeny
,
more
rigorous
approaches
that
work
directly
with
the
matrix
exponential
of
the
underlying
continuous-time
Markov
chain
also
show
promise
,
especially
in
view
of
recent
advances
.

In
the
postgenomic
era
,
high
throughput
protein
expression
and
protein
microarray
technologies
have
progressed
markedly
permitting
screening
of
therapeutic
reagents
and
discovery
of
novel
protein
functions
.

Hexa-histidine
is
one
of
the
most
commonly
used
fusion
tags
for
protein
expression
due
to
its
small
size
and
convenient
purification
via
immobilized
metal
ion
affinity
chromatography
(
IMAC
)
.

This
purification
process
has
been
adapted
to
the
protein
microarray
format
,
but
the
quality
of
in
situ
His-tagged
protein
purification
on
slides
has
not
been
systematically
evaluated
.

We
established
methods
to
determine
the
level
of
purification
of
such
proteins
on
metal
chelate-modified
slide
surfaces
.

Optimized
in
situ
purification
of
His-tagged
recombinant
proteins
has
the
potential
to
become
the
new
gold
standard
for
cost-effective
generation
of
high-quality
and
high-density
protein
microarrays
.

Results
:
Two
slide
surfaces
were
examined
,
chelated
Cu
2+

suspended
on
a
polyethylene

(
PEG
)
coating
and
chelated
Ni
2+
slides
immobilized
on
a
support
without
PEG
coating
.

Using
PEG-coated
chelated
Cu
2+
slides
,
consistently
higher
purities
of
recombinant
proteins
were
measured
.

Using

Streptococcus

,
73
proteins
were
successfully
immobilized
,
and
66
proteins
were
in

purified
with
greater
than
90

purity
.

We
identified
several
antigens
among
the
in

proteins
via
assays
with
anti-S.

The
methodology
is
compatible
with
higher
throughput
formats
of
in

protein
expression
,
eliminates
the
need
for
resin-based
purification
and
circumvents
protein
solubility
and
denaturation
problems
caused
by
buffer
exchange
steps
and
freeze-thaw
cycles
,
which
are
associated
with
resin-based
purification
,
intermittent
protein
storage
and
deposition
on
microarrays
.

Conclusion
:
An
optimized
platform
for
in
situ
protein
purification
on
microarray
slides
using
Histagged
recombinant
proteins
is
a
desirable
tool
for
the
screening
of
novel
protein
functions
and
protein-protein
interactions
.

In
the
context
of
immunoproteomics
,
such
protein
microarrays
are
complimentary
to
approaches
using
non-recombinant

Lianhua-Qingwen
capsule
(
LQC
)
is
a
commonly
used
Chinese
medical
preparation
to
treat
viral
influenza
and
especially
played
a
very
important
role
in
the
fight
against
severe
acute
respiratory
syndrome
(
SARS
)
in
2002-2003
in
China
.

In
this
paper
,
a
rapid
ultraperformance
liquid
chromatography
coupled
with
diode-array
detector
and
quadrupole
time-of-flight
mass
spectrometry
(
UPLC-DAD-QTOF-MS
)
method
was
established
for
qualitative
and
quantitative
analysis
of
the
major
constituents
of
LQC
.

A
total
of
61
compounds
including
flavonoids
,
phenylpropanoids
,
anthraquinones
,
triterpenoids
,
iridoids
,
and
other
types
of
compounds
were
unambiguously
or
tentatively
identified
by
comparing
the
retention
times
and
accurate
mass
measurement
with
reference
compounds
or
literature
data
.

Among
them
,
twelve
representative
compounds
were
further
quantified
as
chemical
markers
in
quantitative
analysis
,
including
salidroside
,
chlorogenic
acid
,
forsythoside
E
,
cryptochlorogenic
acid
,
amygdalin
,
sweroside
,
hyperin
,
rutin
,
forsythoside
A
,
phillyrin
,
rhein
,
and
glycyrrhizic
acid
.

The
UPLC-DAD
method
was
evaluated
with
linearity
,
limit
of
detection
(
LOD
)
,
limit
of
quantification
(
LOQ
)
,
precision
,
stability
,
repeatability
,
and
recovery
tests
.

The
results
showed
that
the
developed
quantitative
method
was
linear
,
sensitive
,
and
precise
for
the
quality
control
of
LQC
.

The
appearance
of
Cryptococcus
gattii
in
the
North
American
Pacific
Northwest
(
PNW
)
in
1999
was
an
unexpected
and
is
still
an
unexplained
event
.

Recent
phylogenomic
analyses
strongly
suggest
that
this
pathogenic
fungus
arrived
in
the
PNW
approximately
7
to
9
decades
ago
.

In
this
paper
,
we
theorize
that
the
ancestors
of
the
PNW
C.
gattii
clones
arrived
in
the
area
by
shipborne
transport
,
possibly
in
contaminated
ballast
,
and
established
themselves
in
coastal
waters
early
in
the
20th
century
.

In
1964
,
a
tsunami
flooded
local
coastal
regions
,
transporting
C.
gattii
to
land
.

The
occurrence
of
cryptococcosis
in
animals
and
humans
3
decades
later
suggests
that
adaptation
to
local
environs
took
time
,
possibly
requiring
an
increase
in
virulence
and
further
dispersal
.

Tsunamis
as
a
mechanism
for
the
seeding
of
land
with
pathogenic
waterborne
microbes
may
have
important
implications
for
our
understanding
of
how
infectious
diseases
emerge
in
certain
regions
.

This
hypothesis
suggests
experimental
work
for
its
validation
or
refutation
.

RNA
viruses
are
capable
of
rapid
spread
and
severe
or
potentially
lethal
disease
in
both
animals
and
humans
.

The
development
of
reverse
genetics
systems
for
manipulation
and
study
of
RNA
virus
genomes
has
provided
platforms
for
designing
and
optimizing
viral
mutants
for
vaccine
development
.

Here
,
we
review
the
impact
of
RNA
virus
reverse
genetics
systems
on
past
and
current
efforts
to
design
effective

Background
.

Zika
virus
(
ZIKV
)
transmission
has
been
reported
in
67
countries/territories
in
the
Oceania
region
and
the
Americas
since
2015
,
prompting
the
World
Health
Organization
(
WHO
)
to
declare
ZIKV
as
a
Public
Health
Emergency
of
International
Concern
in
February
2016
,
due
to
its
strong
association
with
medical
complications
such
as
microcephaly
and
Guillain-BarrÃ©
Syndrome
(
GBS
)
.

However
,
a
substantial
gap
in
knowledge
still
exists
regarding
differing
temporal
pattern
and
potential
of
transmission
of
ZIKV
in
different
regions
of
the
world
.

Methods
.

We
use
a
phenomenological
model
to
ascertain
the
temporal
patterns
and
transmission
potential
of
ZIKV
in
various
countries/territories
,
by
fitting
the
model
to
Zika
case
data
from
Yap
Island
and
French
Polynesia
in
the
Oceania
region
and
11
countries/territories
with
confirmed
case
data
,
namely
,
Colombia
,
Ecuador
,
French
Guiana
,
Guadeloupe
,
Guatemala
,
Mexico
,
Nicaragua
,
Panama
,
Puerto
Rico
,
Saint
Martin
,
and
Suriname
,
to
pinpoint
the
waves
of
infections
in
each
country/territory
and
to
estimate
the
respective
basic
reproduction
number
R
0
.

Results
.

Six
of
these
time
series
datasets
resulted
in
statistically
significant
model
fit
of
at
least
one
wave
of
reported
cases
,
namely
that
of
French
Polynesia
,
Colombia
,
Puerto
Rico
,
Guatemala
,
Suriname
and
Saint
Martin
.

However
,
only
Colombia
and
Guatemala
exhibited
two
waves
of
cases
while
the
others
had
only
one
wave
.

Temporal
patterns
of
the
second
wave
in
Colombia
and
the
single
wave
in
Suriname
are
very
similar
,
with
the
respective
turning
points
separated
by
merely
a
week
.

Moreover
,
the
mean
estimates
of
R
0
for
Colombia
,
Guatemala
and
Suriname
,
all
land-based
populations
,
range
between
1.05
and
1.75
,
while
the
corresponding
mean
estimates
for
R
0
of
island
populations
in
French
Polynesia
,
Puerto
Rico
and
Saint
Martin
are
significantly
lower
with
a
range
of
5.70-6.89
.

We
also
fit
the
Richards
model
to
Zika
case
data
from
six
main
archipelagos
in
French
Polynesia
,
suggesting
the
outbreak
in
all
six
island
populations
occurred
during
the
same
time
,
albeit
with
different
peak
time
,
with
mean
R
0
range
of
3.09-5.05
.

Discussion
.

Using
the
same
modeling
methodology
,
in
this
study
we
found
a
significant
difference
between
transmissibility
(
as
quantified
by
R
0
)
in
island
populations
as
opposed
to
land-based
countries/territories
,
possibly
suggesting
an
important
role
of
geographic
heterogeneity
in
the
spread
of
vector-borne
diseases
and
its
future
course
,
which
requires
further
monitoring
.

Our
result
has
potential
implications
for
planning
respective
intervention
and
control
policies
targeted
for
island
and
land-based
populations

JEV
NS1-specific
antibody
responses
could
be
a
target
in
the
differential
diagnosis
of
different
flavivirus
infections
.

However
,
the
epitopes
on
JEV
NS1
are
poorly
characterized
.

The
present
study
describes
the
full
mapping
of
linear
B-cell
epitopes
in
JEV
NS1
.

We
generated
eleven
NS1-specific
monoclonal
antibodies
from
mice
immunized
with
recombinant
NS1
.

For
epitope
mapping
of
monoclonal
antibodies
,
a
set
of
51
partially-overlapping
peptides
covering
the
entire
NS1
protein
were
expressed
with
a
GST-tag
and
then
screened
using
monoclonal
antibodies
.

Through
enzyme-linked
immunosorbent
assay
(
ELISA
)
,
five
linear
epitope-containing
peptides
were
identified
.

By
sequentially
removing
amino
acid
residues
from
the
carboxy
and
amino
terminal
of
peptides
,
the
minimal
units
of
the
five
linear
epitopes
were
identified
and
confirmed
using
monoclonal
antibodies
.

Five

.

Furthermore
,
it
was
found
that
the
epitopes
are
highly
conserved
among
JEV
strains
through
sequence
alignment
.

Notably
,
none
of
the
homologous
regions
on
NS1
proteins
from
other
flaviviruses
reacted
with
the
MAbs
when
they
were
tested
for
cross-reactivity
,
and
all
five
epitope
peptides
were
not
recognized
by
sera
against
West
Nile
virus
or
Dengue
virus
.

These
novel
virus-specific
linear
B-cell
epitopes
of
JEV
NS1
would
benefit
the
development
of
new
vaccines
and
diagnostic
assays
.

Melanoma
,
a
potentially
lethal
skin
cancer
,
is
widely
thought
to
be
immunogenic
in
nature
.

While
there
has
been
much
focus
on
T
cell-mediated
immune
responses
,
limited
knowledge
exists
on
the
role
of
mature
B
cells
.

We
describe
an
approach
,
including
a
cell-based
ELISA
,
to
evaluate
mature
IgG
antibody
responses
to
melanoma
from
human
peripheral
blood
B
cells
.

We
observed
a
significant
increase
in
antibody
responses
from
melanoma
patients
(
n
=
10
)
to
primary
and
metastatic
melanoma
cells
compared
to
healthy
volunteers
(
n
=
10
)
(
P,0.0001
)
.

Interestingly
,
we
detected
a
significant
reduction
in
antibody
responses
to
melanoma
with
advancing
disease
stage
in
our
patient
cohort
(
n
=
21
)
(
P,0.0001
)
.

Overall
,
28
%
of
melanoma
patient-derived
B
cell
cultures
(
n
=
1,800
)
compared
to
2
%
of
cultures
from
healthy
controls
(
n
=
600
)
produced
antibodies
that
recognized
melanoma
cells
.

Lastly
,
a
patient-derived
melanoma-specific
monoclonal
antibody
was
selected
for
further
study
.

This
antibody
effectively
killed
melanoma
cells
in
vitro
via
antibody-mediated
cellular
cytotoxicity
.

These
data
demonstrate
the
presence
of
a
mature
systemic
B
cell
response
in
melanoma
patients
,
which
is
reduced
with
disease
progression
,
adding
to
previous
reports
of
tumor-reactive
antibodies
in
patient
sera
,
and
suggesting
the
merit
of
future
work
to
elucidate
the
clinical
relevance
of
activating
humoral
immune
responses
to
cancer
.

been
proven
to
be
the

.

There
are
mouse

that
can
passively
protect

there
are
no
anti-Yersinia
pestis
monoclonal
antibodies
available
for
prophylactic
or

treatment
in

.

We
identified
one
anti-F1-specific

mAb
(

)
and
two
anti-V-specific

.

The
Fabs
were
converted
to
IgG1s
and
their
binding
and
protective
activities
were
evaluated
.

M252
bound
weakly
to
peptides
located
at
the
F1
N-terminus
where
a
protective
mouse
anti-F1

also
binds
.

M253
bound
strongly
to
a

peptide
indicating
a

;
m254
did
not
bind
to
any
peptide
from
a
panel
of
53
peptides
suggesting
that
its
epitope
may
be

M252
showed
better
protection
than
m253
and
m254
against
a

.

In
the
United

,
more
than
3,00,000

are
admitted

about
20,000

Traditional
diagnostic
assays
often
lack
sensitivity
and
can
be
difficult
to
multiplex
across
many
pathogens
.

Next-generation
sequencing
(
NGS
)
can
overcome
some
of
these
problems
but
has
limited
application
in
the
detection
of
low-copynumber
pathogens
in
complex
samples
.

Targeted
genome
capture
(
TGC
)
utilizes
oligonucleotide
probes
to
enrich
specific
nucleic
acids
in
heterogeneous
extracts
and
can
therefore
increase
the
proportion
of
NGS
reads
for
low-abundance
targets
.

While
earlier
studies
have
demonstrated
the
utility
of
this
technology
for
detection
of
novel
pathogens
in
human
clinical
samples
,
the
capacity
and
practicality
of
TGC-NGS
in
a
veterinary
diagnostic
setting
have
not
yet
been
evaluated
.

Here
we
report
the
use
of
TGC-NGS
assays
for
the
detection
and
characterization
of
diverse
feline
pathogen
taxa
.

We
detected
31
pathogens
comprising
nine
pathogen
taxa
in
28
felid
samples
analyzed
.

This
included
20
pathogens
detected
via
traditional
PCR
and
11
additional
pathogens
that
had
not
been
previously
detected
in
the
same
samples
.

Most
of
the
pathogens
detected
were
sequenced
at
sufficient
breadth
and
depth
to
confidently
classify
them
at
the
species
or
subspecies
level
.

Target
nucleic
acids
were
enriched
from
a
low
of
58-fold
to
56
million-fold
relative
to
host
nucleic
acids
.

Despite
the
promising
performance
of
these
assays
,
a
number
of
pathogens
detected
by
conventional
PCR
or
serology
were
not
isolated
by
TGC-NGS
,
suggesting
that
further
validation
is
required
before
this
technology
can
be
used
in
lieu
of
quality-controlled
standard
assays
.

We
conclude
that
TGC-NGS
offers
great
potential
as
a
broad
multiplex
pathogen
characterization
assay
in
veterinary
diagnostic
and
research
settings
.

Since
the
emergence
of
the
first
cases
in
Wuhan
,
China
,
the
novel
coronavirus
(
2019-nCoV
)
infection
has
been
quickly
spreading
out
to
other
provinces
and
neighboring
countries
.

Estimation
of
the
basic
reproduction
number
by
means
of
mathematical
modeling
can
be
helpful
for
determining
the
potential
and
severity
of
an
outbreak
and
providing
critical
information
for
identifying
the
type
of
disease
interventions
and
intensity
.

A
deterministic
compartmental
model
was
devised
based
on
the
clinical
progression
of
the
disease
,
epidemiological
status
of
the
individuals
,
and
intervention
measures
.

The
estimations
based
on
likelihood
and
model
analysis
show
that
the
control
reproduction
number
may
be
as
high
as
6.47
(
95
%
CI
5.71-7.23
)
.

Sensitivity
analyses
show
that
interventions
,
such
as
intensive
contact
tracing
followed
by
quarantine
and
isolation
,
can
effectively
reduce
the
control
reproduction
number
and
transmission
risk
,
with
the
effect
of
travel
restriction
adopted
by
Wuhan
on
2019-nCoV
infection
in
Beijing
being
almost
equivalent
to
increasing
quarantine
by
a
100
thousand
baseline
value
.

It
is
essential
to
assess
how
the
expensive
,
resource-intensive
measures
implemented
by
the
Chinese
authorities
can
contribute
to
the
prevention
and
control
of
the
2019-nCoV
infection
,
and
how
long
they
should
be
maintained
.

Under
the
most
restrictive
measures
,
the
outbreak
is
expected
to
peak
within
two
weeks
(
since
23
January
2020
)
with
a
significant
low
peak
value
.

With
travel
restriction
(
no
imported
exposed
individuals
to
Beijing
)
,
the
number
of
infected
individuals
in
seven
days
will
decrease
by
91.14
%
in
Beijing
,
compared
with
the
scenario
of
no
travel
restriction
.

The
number
of
pneumonia
patients
increased
suddenly
in
Korean
military
hospitals
in
late
December
2014
,
indicating
the
urgent
need
for
an
epidemic
outbreak
investigation
.

We
conducted
a
prospective
study
of
pneumonia
etiology
among
immunocompetent
young
adults
admitted
to
Daejeon
Armed
Forces
hospital
.

Patient
blood
and
sputum
samples
were
subjected
to
conventional
culture
,
serology
,
and
polymerase
chain
reaction
tests
for
respiratory
viruses
and
atypical
pathogens
.

From
January
to
May
2015
,
we
enrolled
191
(
189
male
)
adults
with
pneumonia
;
the
mean

was
20.1
Â±
1.3
years
.

Five
patients
had
severe
pneumonia
,
and
one
died
.

Pathogenic
human
adenoviruses
were
most
common
(
HAdV
,
153/191
[
80.1
%
]
)
,
indicating
a
HAdV
pneumonia
outbreak
.

Genotyping
of
35
isolates
indicated
that
34
matched
HAdV-55
and
one
matched

Background
:
It
is
a
commonly
accepted
belief
that
cancer
cells
modify
their
transcriptional
state
during
the
progression
of
the
disease
.

We
propose
that
the
progression
of
cancer
cells
towards
malignant
phenotypes
can
be
efficiently
tracked
using
high-throughput
technologies
that
follow
the
gradual
changes
observed
in
the
gene
expression
profiles
by
employing
Shannon
's
mathematical
theory
of
communication
.

Methods
based
on
Information
Theory
can
then
quantify
the
divergence
of
cancer
cells
'
transcriptional
profiles
from
those
of
normally
appearing
cells
of
the
originating
tissues
.

The
relevance
of
the
proposed
methods
can
be
evaluated
using
microarray
datasets
available
in
the
public
domain
but
the
method
is
in
principle
applicable
to
other
high-throughput
methods
.

Methodology/Principal
Findings
:
Using
melanoma
and
prostate
cancer
datasets
we
illustrate
how
it
is
possible
to
employ
Shannon
Entropy
and
the
Jensen-Shannon
divergence
to
trace
the
transcriptional
changes
progression
of
the
disease
.

We
establish
how
the
variations
of
these
two
measures
correlate
with
established
biomarkers
of
cancer
progression
.

The
Information
Theory
measures
allow
us
to
identify
novel
biomarkers
for
both
progressive
and
relatively
more
sudden
transcriptional
changes
leading
to
malignant
phenotypes
.

At
the
same
time
,
the
methodology
was
able
to
validate
a
large
number
of
genes
and
processes
that
seem
to
be
implicated
in
the
progression
of
melanoma
and
prostate
cancer
.

Conclusions/Significance
:
We
thus
present
a
quantitative
guiding
rule
,
a
new
unifying
hallmark
of
cancer
:
the
cancer
cell
's
transcriptome
changes
lead
to
measurable
observed
transitions
of
Normalized
Shannon
Entropy
values
(
as
measured
by
high-througput
technologies
)
.

At
the
same
time
,
tumor
cells
increment
their
divergence
from
the
normal
tissue
profile
increasing
their
disorder
via
creation
of
states
that
we
might
not
directly
measure
.

This
unifying
hallmark
allows
,
via
the
the
Jensen-Shannon
divergence
,
to
identify
the
arrow
of
time
of
the
processes
from
the
gene
expression
profiles
,
and
helps
to
map
the
phenotypical
and
molecular
hallmarks
of
specific
cancer
subtypes
.

The
deep
mathematical
basis
of
the
approach
allows
us
to
suggest
that
this
principle
is
,
hopefully
,
of
general
applicability
for
other
diseases

We
have
seen
in

that
the

and
the
MPR-Statistical
Complexity
differentiate
the

,
but
that
these
two
measures
can
not
help
to
discriminate
the
primary
tumors
from
the
normals
.

We
show
here
the
results
of
two
statistical
complexity
measures
which
are
in
some
sense
supervised
(
i.e
.

dependent
on
the
dataset
being
interrogated
)
.

We
call
these
two
stastical
mesured
M-Normal
and
M-Metastases
.

They
have
the
same
functional
form
of
the
MPR-Statistical
Complexity
,
but
they
use
the
average
normal
and
average
metastatic
profile
as
probability
distribution
functions
of
reference
.

As
a
consequence
,
the
M-normal
and
M-metastases
are
directly
proportional
to
the
Jensen-Shannon
divergences
with
the
normal
(
and
respectively
with
the
metastatic
)
gene
expression
profile
.

It
is
remarkable
that
,
although
we
are
using
these
end
processes
only
(
from
Lapointe
et
al
's
,
dataset
of
5,153
probes6112
samples
)
,
most
of
the
primary
tumor
samples
appear
as
a
transitional
state
between
the
normal
and
metastatic
group
.

This
is
remarkable
since
the
primary
tumor
samples
were
not
used
to
define
the
M-normal
and
M-metastases
measures
and
,
in
principle
,
the
samples
could
have
been
located
anywhere
in
the
(
M-normal
,
M-metastases
)
-plane
.

Computation

help
us

(
MERS-CoV
)
is
a
virus
that
causes
severe
viral
pneumonia
in
humans
,
known
to
have
a
high
mortality
rate
and
a
similarity
in
clinical
symptoms
with
severe
acute
respiratory

coronavirus
.

It
was
first
isolated
in
Kingdom
of
Saudi
Arabia
(

)
in
2012
and
after
that
,
MERS-CoV
exhibited
outbreaks
in
several
regions
of
the
world
.

This
study
aimed
to
assess
the
characteristics
of

day
in
order
to
avoid
the
possible
bias
came
from
update
on
the
database
because
the
metrics
are
changing
over
time
.

All
publication

were
considered
;
however
publications

Results
:
A
total
of
883
MERS-CoV
research
publications
were
published
across
the
world
.

The
MERS-CoV-associated
publications
were
originated
from
92
countries/territories
,
indicating
the
international
spread
of
MERS-CoV

.

The
USA
was
the
largest
contributor
,
with
319
articles
published
over
4
years
,
followed
by
KSA
(
113

)
.

The
total
number

.

The
h-index
for
MERS-CoV-associated

was
48
.

The
USA
also
have
the
highest

,
followed
by
KSA
(

.

Netherland
produced
the
greatest

Conclusions
:
There
is
a
rapid
increase
in
research
activities
related
to
MERS-CoV
from
2012
to
2015
.

This
study
demonstrates
that
the
MERS-CoV
related
literature
has
grown
to
be
more
extensive
and
global
over
the
past
4
years
.

The
bulk
of
publications
in
the
field
of
MERS-CoV
research
are
published
by
high-income
countries
such
as
the
USA
.

Furthermore
,
the
USA
,
the
UK
and

may
have
higher
quality
of

The
family
of
type
I
interferons
(
IFN
)
,
which
consists
of
several
IFN-a
and
one
IFN-b
,
are
produced
not
only
after
stimulation
by
viruses
,
but
also
after
infection
with
non-viral
pathogens
.

In
the
course
of
bacterial
infections
,
these
cytokines
could
be
beneficial
or
detrimental
.

IFN-b
is
the
primary
member
of
type
I
IFN
that
initiates
a
cascade
of
IFN-a
production
.

Here
we
addressed
the
question
which
cells
are
responsible
for
IFN-b
expression
after
infection
with
the
intracellular
pathogen
Listeria
monocytogenes
by
using
a
genetic
approach
.

By
means
of
newly
established
reporter
mice
,
maximum
of
IFN-b
expression
was
observed
at
24
hours
post
infection
in
spleen
and
,
surprisingly
,
48
hours
post
infection
in
colonized
cervical
and
inguinal
lymph
nodes
.

Colonization
of
lymph
nodes
was
independent
of
the
type
I
IFN
signaling
,
as
well
as
bacterial
dose
and
strain
.

Using
cell
specific
reporter
function
and
conditional
deletions
we
could
define
cells
expressing
LysM
as
the
major
IFN-b
producers
,
with
cells
formerly
defined
as
Tip-DCs
being
the
highest
.

Neutrophilic
granulocytes
,
dendritic
cells
and
plasmacytoid
dendritic
cells
did
not
significantly
contribute
to
type
I
IFN
production

(
MERS-CoV
)
,
severe
acute
respiratory
syndrome
coronavirus
(
SARS-CoV
)
,
Zika
virus
,
and
Dengue
virus
.

In
particular
,
avian
influenza
virus
(
AIV
)
is
highly
infectious
and
causes
economic
,
health
,
ethnical
,
and
social
problems
to
human
beings
,
which
has
necessitated
the
development
of
an
ultrasensitive
and
selective
rapid-detection
system
of
AIV
.

To
prevent
the
damage
associated
with
the
spread
of
AIV
,
early
detection
and
adequate
treatment
of
AIV
is
key
.

There
are
traditional
techniques
that
have
been
used
to
detect
AIV
in
chickens
,
ducks
,
humans
,
and
other
living
organisms
.

However
,
the
development
of
a
technique
that
allows
for
the
more
rapid
diagnosis
of
AIV
is
still
necessary
.

To
achieve
this
goal
,
the
present
article
reviews
the
use
of
an
AIV
biosensor
employing
nanobio
hybrid
materials
to
enhance
the
sensitivity
and
selectivity
of
the
technique
while
also
reducing
the
detection
time
and
high-throughput
process
time
.

This
review
mainly
focused
on
four
techniques
:
the
electrochemical
detection
system
,
electrical
detection
method
,
optical
detection
methods
based
on
localized
surface
plasmon
resonance
,
and
fluorescence
.

Bats
are
associated
with
several
important
zoonotic
viruses
from
different
families
.

One
example
includes
adeno-associated
viruses
(
AAVs
)
,
that
are
extensively
detected
in
several
animals
,
especially
primates
.

To
understand
AAVs
distribution
and
genetic
diversity
in
the
coastal
areas
of
Southeast
China
,
a
total
of
415
intestine
samples
were
mostly
collected
from
two
provinces
of
southeast
China
,
i.e.
,
Zhejiang
and
Fujian
province
.

Intestine
samples
from
five
bat
species
were
collected
for
AAVs
detection
.

The
average
prevalence
rate
for
AAV
detection
among
these
samples
was
18.6
%
(
77
positives
out
of
415
samples
)
and
ranged
from
11.8
to
28.9
%
between
the
five
bat
species
.

This
suggests
that
AAVs
are
widely
distributed
in
diverse
bat
populations
in
southeast
coastal
areas
of
China
.

Based
on
the
genome
sequence
of
bat
adeno-associated
virus-CXC1
(
BtAAV-CXC1
)
from
one
AAV-positive
sample
,
the
genetic
diversity
of
the
detected
AAVs
were
assessed
and
analyzed
.

Phylogenetic
analysis
revealed
that
BtAAV-CXC1
was
comparatively
distant
to
other
major
AAVs
from
mammals
and
non-mammals
,
with
only
a
52.9~64.7
%
nucleotide
identity
.

However
,
they
were
phylogenetically
closer
to
Rhinolophus
sinicus
bat
adeno-associated
virus
(
Rs-BtAAV1
)
,
with
a
74.5
%
nt
similarity
.

Partial
analysis
of
the
rep
and
cap
overlapping
open
reading
frame
(
ORF
)
sequences
from
bat
AAV
samples
revealed
48
partial
rep
sequences
and
23
partial
cap
sequences
from
positive
samples
shared
86.9
to
100
%
and
72.3
to
98.8
%
nucleotide
identities
among
themselves
,
respectively
.

This
suggests
that
the
detected
AAVs
had
a
distinctly
high
genetic
diversity
.

These
findings
led
us
to
conclude
that
diverse
AAVs
may
be
widely
distributed
in
bat
populations
from
the
southeast
regions
of
China
.

Background
.

Human
rhinoviruses
(
HRVs
)
are
the
most
prevalent
human
pathogens
,
and
consist
of
101
serotypes
that
are
classified
into
groups
A
and
B
according
to
sequence
variations
.

HRV
infections
cause
a
wide
spectrum
of
clinical
outcomes
ranging
from
asymptomatic
infection
to
severe
lower
respiratory
symptoms
.

Defining
the
role
of
specific
strains
in
various
HRV
illnesses
has
been
difficult
because
traditional
serology
,
which
requires
viral
culture
and
neutralization
tests
using
101
serotype-specific
antisera
,
is
insensitive
and
laborious
.

Methods
and
Findings
.

To
directly
type
HRVs
in
nasal
secretions
of
infants
with
frequent
respiratory
illnesses
,
we
developed
a
sensitive
molecular
typing
assay
based
on
phylogenetic
comparisons
of
a
260-bp
variable
sequence
in
the
5
'
noncoding
region
with
homologous
sequences
of
the
101
known
serotypes
.

Nasal
samples
from
26
infants
were
first
tested
with
a
multiplex
PCR
assay
for
respiratory
viruses
,
and
HRV
was
the
most
common
virus
found
(
108
of
181
samples
)
.

Typing
was
completed
for
101
samples
and
103
HRVs
were
identified
.

Surprisingly
,
54
(
52.4
%
)
HRVs
did
not
match
any
of
the
known
serotypes
and
had
12-35
%
nucleotide
divergence
from
the
nearest
reference
HRVs
.

Of
these
novel
viruses
,
9
strains
(
17
HRVs
)
segregated
from
HRVA
,
HRVB
and
human
enterovirus
into
a
distinct
genetic
group
(
``
C
''
)
.

None
of
these
new
strains
could
be
cultured
in
traditional
cell
lines
.

Conclusions
.

By
molecular
analysis
,
over
50
%
of
HRV
detected
in
sick
infants
were
previously
unrecognized
strains
,
including
9
strains
that
may
represent
a
new
HRV
group
.

These
findings
indicate
that
the
number
of
HRV
strains
is
considerably
larger
than
the
101
serotypes
identified
with
traditional
diagnostic
techniques
,
and
provide
evidence
of
a
new
HRV
group
.

Background
.

Atherosclerosis
is
a
chronic
inflammatory
disease
and
the
acute
clinical
manifestations
represent
acute
on
chronic
inflammation
.

Neutrophil
gelatinase-associated
lipocalin
(
NGAL
)
is
found
in
the
granules
of
human
neutrophils
,
with
many
diverse
functions
.

The
aim
of
this
study
was
to
evaluate
the
hypothesis
that
levels
NGAL
in
blood
may
reflect
the
inflammatory
process
in
various
stages
of
coronary
artery
disease
.

Methods
.

We
studied
140
patients
,
with
SA
40
,
UA
35
,
NSTEMI
40
,
and
STEMI
25
,
and
20
healthy
controls
.

Serum
NGAL
was
measured
upon
admission
and
before
coronary
angiography
.

Results
.

Significant
differences
were
observed
in
median
serum-NGAL
(
ng/mL
)
between
patients
with

)
with
significant
incremental
value
from
SA
to
STEMI
.

We
observed
a
positive
and
significant
correlation
between
serum-NGAL
and
hs-CRP
(
spearman
coefficient
rho
=
0.685
,
P

well
as
with
neutrophil
counts
(
r
=
0.511
,
P
<

)
.

Conclusions
.

In
patients
with
coronary
artery
disease
serum
levels
of
NGAL
increase
and
reflect
the
degree
of
inflammatory
process
.

In
patients
with
acute
coronary
syndromes
,
serum
levels
of
NGAL
have
high
negative
predictive
value
and
reflecting
the
inflammatory
status
could
show
the
severity
of
coronary
clinical
syndrome
.

Background
:
Non-pharmaceutical
interventions
(
NPIs
)
constituted
the
principal
public
health
response
to
the
previous
influenza
A
(
H1N1
)
2009
pandemic
and
are
one
key
area
of
ongoing
preparation
for
future
pandemics
.

Thailand
is
an
important
point
of
focus
in
terms
of
global
pandemic
preparedness
and
response
due
to
its
role
as
the
major
transportation
hub
for
Southeast
Asia
,
the
endemic
presence
of
multiple
types
of
influenza
,
and
its
role
as
a
major
receiving
country
for
migrants
.

Our
aim
was
to
collect
information
about
vulnerable
migrants
'
perceptions
of
and
ability
to
implement
NPIs
proposed
by
the
WHO
.

We
hope
that
this
information
will
help
us
to
gauge
the
capacity
of
this
population
to
engage
in
pandemic
preparedness
and
response
efforts
,
and
to
identify
potential
barriers
to
NPI
effectiveness
.

Methods
:
A
cross-sectional
survey
was
performed
.

The
study
was
conducted
during
the
influenza
H1N1
2009
pandemic
and
included
801
migrant
participants
living
in
border
areas
thought
to
be
high
risk
by
the
Thailand
Ministry
of
Public
Health
.

Data
were
collected
by
Migrant
Community
Health
Workers
using
a
201-item
interviewer-assisted
questionnaire
.

Univariate
descriptive
analyses
were
conducted
.

Results
:
With
the
exception
of
border
measures
,
to
which
nearly
all
participants
reported
they
would
be
adherent
,
attitudes
towards
recommended
NPIs
were
generally
negative
or
uncertain
.

Other
potential
barriers
to
NPI
implementation
include
limited
experience
applying
these
interventions
(
e.g.
,
using
a
thermometer
,
wearing
a
face
mask
)
and
inadequate
hand
washing
and
household
disinfection
practices
.

Conclusions
:
Negative
or
ambivalent
attitudes
towards
NPIs
combined
with
other
barriers
identified
suggest
that
vulnerable
migrants
in
Thailand
have
a
limited
capacity
to
participate
in
pandemic
preparedness
efforts
.

This
limited
capacity
likely
puts
migrants
at
risk
of
propagating
the
spread
of
a
pandemic
virus
.

Coordinated
risk
communication
and
public
education
are
potential
strategies
that
may
reduce
barriers
to
individual
NPI
implementation
.

The
enteric
disease
of
swine
recognized
in
the
early
1970s
in
Europe
was
initially
described
as
``
epidemic
viral
diarrhea
''
and
is
now
termed
``
porcine
epidemic
diarrhea
(
PED
)
''
.

The
coronavirus
referred
to
as
PED
virus
(
PEDV
)
was
determined
to
be
the
etiologic
agent
of
this
disease
in
the
late
1970s
.

Since
then
the
disease
has
been
reported
in
Europe
and
Asia
,
but
the
most
severe
outbreaks
have
occurred
predominantly
in
Asian
swine-producing
countries
.

Most
recently
,
PED
first
emerged
in
early
2013
in
the
United
States
that
caused
high
morbidity
and
mortality
associated
with
PED
,
remarkably
affecting
US
pig
production
,
and
spread
further
to
Canada
and
Mexico
.

Soon
thereafter
,
large-scale
PED
epidemics
recurred
through
the
pork
industry
in
South
Korea
,
Japan
,
and
Taiwan
.

These
recent
outbreaks
and
global
re-emergence
of
PED
require
urgent
attention
and
deeper
understanding
of
PEDV
biology
and
pathogenic
mechanisms
.

This
paper
highlights
the
current
knowledge
of
molecular
epidemiology
,
diagnosis
,
and
pathogenesis
of
PEDV
,
as
well
as
prevention
and
control
measures
against
PEDV
infection
.

More
information
about
the
virus
and
the
disease
is
still
necessary
for
the
development
of
effective
vaccines
and
control
strategies
.

It
is
hoped
that
this
review
will
stimulate
further
basic
and
applied
studies
and
encourage
collaboration
among
producers
,
researchers
,
and
swine
veterinarians
to
provide
answers
that
improve
our
understanding
of
PEDV
and
PED
in
an
effort
to
eliminate
this
economically
significant
viral
disease
,
which
emerged
or
re-emerged
worldwide
.

Multipartitism
counts
amongst
the
weirdest
lifestyles
found
in
the
virosphere
.

Multipartite
viruses
have
genomes
segmented
in
pieces
enclosed
in
different
capsids
that
are
independently
transmitted
.

Since
all
segments
have
to
meet
in
the
host
for
complementation
and
completion
of
the
viral
cycle
,
multipartite
viruses
are
bound
to
fight
the
loss
of
genomic
information
.

While
this
is
an
obvious
disadvantage
of
this
strategy
,
no
consensus
on
its
actual
advantages
has
been
reached
.

In
this
review
we
present
an
exhaustive
summary
of
all
multipartite
viruses
described
to
date
.

Based
on
evidence
,
we
discuss
possible
mechanistic
and
evolutionary
origins
of
different
groups
,
as
well
as
their
mutual
relationships
.

We
argue
that
the
ubiquitous
interactions
of
viruses
with
other
unrelated
viruses
and
with
subviral
elements
might
be
regarded
as
a
plausible
first
step
towards
multipartitism
.

In
agreement
with
the
view
of
the
Virosphere
as
a
deeply
entangled
network
of
gene
sharing
,
we
contend
that
the
power
of
multipartitism
relies
on
its
dynamical
and
opportunistic
nature
,
because
it
enables
immediate
adaptive
responses
to
environmental
changes
.

As
such
,
perhaps
the
reasons
for
its
success
should
be
shought
in
multipartitism
itself
as
an
adaptive
mechanism
,
to
which
its
evolutionarily
short-lived
products
(
that
is
,
the
extant
ensemble
of
multipartite
viral
species
)
are
subordinated
.

We
close
by
discussing
how
our
understanding
of
multipartitism
would
improve
by
using
concepts
and
tools
from
systems
biology
.

Diagnostic

be

We
identified
57
primary

and
49
systematic

.

Fifty-six
percent
of
primary
studies
and
53

of
systematic

used
graphical
displays
to

Dot-plot

boxand-whisker
plots
were
the
most

in
primary
studies
and
were
included
in
22

ROC
plots
were
the
most

included
in
systematic

One
primary

Graphical

Diagnostic

need
to
include
multiple

graphic
in

to
provide
both
a
detailed
overview
of
the
results

and
to
communicate
information

Work
is
required
to
improve
graphical
displays
,
to
better
communicate
the
utility
of
a
test
in
clinical
practice
and
the
implications
of
test
results
for
individual
patients
.

Family-wide
molecular
diagnostic
assays
are
valuable
tools
for
initial
identification
of
viruses
during
outbreaks
and
to
limit
costs
of
surveillance
studies
.

Recent
discoveries
of
paramyxoviruses
have
called
for
such
assay
that
is
able
to
detect
all
known
and
unknown
paramyxoviruses
in
one
round
of
PCR
amplification
.

We
have
developed
a
RT-PCR
assay
consisting
of
a
single
degenerate
primer
set
,
able
to
detect
all
members
of
the
Paramyxoviridae
family
including
all
virus
genera
within
the
subfamilies
Paramyxovirinae
and
Pneumovirinae
.

Primers
anneal
to
domain
III
of
the
polymerase
gene
,
with
the
39
end
of
the
reverse
primer
annealing
to
the
conserved
motif
GDNQ
,
which
is
proposed
to
be
the
active
site
for
nucleotide
polymerization
.

The
assay
was
fully
optimized
and
was
shown
to
indeed
detect
all
available
paramyxoviruses
tested
.

Clinical
specimens
from
hospitalized
patients
that
tested
positive
for
known
paramyxoviruses
in
conventional
assays
were
also
detected
with
the
novel
family-wide
test
.

A
high-throughput
fluorescence-based
RT-PCR
version
of
the
assay
was
developed
for
screening
large
numbers
of
specimens
.

A
large
number
of
samples
collected
from
wild
birds
was
tested
,
resulting
in
the
detection
of
avian
paramyxoviruses
type
1
in
both
barnacle
and
white-fronted
geese
,
and
type
8
in
barnacle
geese
.

Avian
metapneumovirus
type
C
was
found
for
the
first
time
in
Europe
in
mallards
,
greylag
geese
and
common
gulls
.

The
single
round
family-wide
RT-PCR
assay
described
here
is
a
useful
tool
for
the
detection
of
known
and
unknown
paramyxoviruses
,
and
screening
of
large
sample
collections
from
humans
and
animals

A
disease
with
a
sudden
drop
in
egg
production
and
shell-less
eggs
called
,
shell-less
egg
syndrome
(
SES
)
has
been
observed
in
Western
Canada
egg
layer
flocks
since
2010
.

The
etiology
of
this
disease
is
not
known
.

We
hypothesize
that
SES
is
caused
by
an
infectious
bronchitis
virus
(
IBV
)
strain
since
it
is
known
that
IBV
replicates
in
the
shell
gland
causing
various
eggshell
abnormalities
.

In
this
study
,
we
screened
egg
layer
flocks
,
in
the
provinces
of
Alberta
(
AB
)
and
Saskatchewan
(
SK
)
,
with
and
without
a
history
of
SES
for
the
presence
of
IBV
infection
.

During
2015-2016
,
a
total
of
27
egg
layer
flocks
were
screened
in
AB
(
n
=
7
)
and
SK
(
n
=
20
)
.

Eighty-one
percent
of
the
screened
flocks
(
n
=
22
)
were
positive
for
IBV
infection
.

Thirty
of
these
isolates
were
successfully
characterized
using
molecular
tools
targeting
the
most
variable
spike
(
S
)
1
gene
.

IBV
isolates
from
this
study
clustered
into
three
genotypes
based
on
partial
S1
gene
variability
.

The
majority
of
the
IBV
isolates
(
70
%
)
were
Massachusetts
(
Mass
)
type
,
and
the
rest
were
either
Connecticut
(
Conn
)
type
or
an
uncharacterized
genotype
with
genetic
characteristics
of
Mass
and
Conn
types
.

Since
the
majority
of
the
IBV
isolates
included
within
the
Mass
type
,
we
used
a
Mass
type
IBV
isolate
to
reproduce
SES
in
specific
pathogen
free
(
SPF
)
white
leghorn
chickens
in
lay
.

Further
studies
are
warranted
to
investigate
whether
other
IBV
isolates
can
cause
SES
,
to
clarify
the
pathogenesis
of
SES
and
to
develop
a
vaccine
in
order
to
prevent
SES
as
observed
in
Western
Canadian
layer
flocks
.
