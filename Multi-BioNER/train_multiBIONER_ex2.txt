Background
:
Canine
rabies
causes
many
thousands
of
human
deaths
every
year
in
Africa
,
and
continues
to
increase
throughout
much
of
the
continent
.
Methodology/Principal
Findings
:
This
paper
identifies
four
common
reasons
given
for
the
lack
of
effective
canine
rabies
control
in
Africa
:
(
a
)
a
low
priority
given
for
disease
control
as
a
result
of
lack
of
awareness
of
the
rabies
burden
;
(
b
)
epidemiological
constraints
such
as
uncertainties
about
the
required
levels
of
vaccination
coverage
and
the
possibility
of
sustained
cycles
of
infection
in
wildlife
;
(
c
)
operational
constraints
including
accessibility
of
dogs
for
vaccination
and
insufficient
knowledge
of
dog
population
sizes
for
planning
of
vaccination
campaigns
;
and
(
d
)
limited
resources
for
implementation
of
rabies
surveillance
and
control
.
We
address
each
of
these
issues
in
turn
,
presenting
data
from
field
studies
and
modelling
approaches
used
in
Tanzania
,
including
burden
of
disease
evaluations
,
detailed
epidemiological
studies
,
operational
data
from
vaccination
campaigns
in
different
demographic
and
ecological
settings
,
and
economic
analyses
of
the
cost-effectiveness
of
dog
vaccination
for
human
rabies
prevention
.
Conclusions/Significance
:
We
conclude
that
there
are
no
insurmountable
problems
to
canine
rabies
control
in
most
of
Africa
;
that
elimination
of
canine
rabies
is
epidemiologically
and
practically
feasible
through
mass
vaccination
of
domestic
dogs
;
and
that
domestic
dog
vaccination
provides
a
cost-effective
approach
to
the
prevention
and
elimination
of
human
rabies
deaths
.
Together
with
the
Gag
protein
,
the
Env
glycoprotein
is
a
major
retroviral
structural
protein
and
is
essential
for
forming
infectious
virus
particles
.
Env
is
synthesized
,
processed
,
and
transported
to
certain
microdomains
at
the
plasma
membrane
and
takes
advantage
of
the
same
host
machinery
for
its
trafficking
as
that
used
by
cellular
glycoproteins
.
Incorporation
of
Env
into
progeny
virions
is
probably
mediated
by
the
interaction
between
Env
and
Gag
,
in
some
cases
with
the
additional
involvement
of
certain
host
factors
.
Although
several
general
models
have
been
proposed
to
explain
the
incorporation
of
retroviral
Env
glycoproteins
into
virions
,
the
actual
mechanism
for
this
process
is
still
unclear
,
partly
because
structural
data
on
the
Env
protein
cytoplasmic
tail
is
lacking
.
This
paper
presents
the
current
understanding
of
the
synthesis
,
trafficking
,
and
virion
incorporation
of
retroviral
Env
proteins
.
Since
COVID-19
transmission
started
in
late
January
,
mathematical
modelling
has
been
at
the
forefront
of
shaping
the
decisions
around
different
non-pharmaceutical
interventions
to
confine
its
'
spread
in
the
UK
and
worldwide
.
This
Editorial
discusses
the
importance
of
modelling
in
understanding
Covid-19
spread
,
highlights
different
modelling
approaches
and
suggests
that
while
modelling
is
important
,
no
one
model
can
give
all
the
answers
.
The
drastic
increase
in
the
number
of
coronaviruses
discovered
and
coronavirus
genomes
being
sequenced
have
given
us
an
unprecedented
opportunity
to
perform
genomics
and
bioinformatics
analysis
on
this
family
of
viruses
.
Coronaviruses
possess
the
largest
genomes
(
26.4
to
31.7
kb
)
among
all
known
RNA
viruses
,
with
G
+
C
contents
varying
from
32
%
to
43
%
.
Variable
numbers
of
small
ORFs
are
present
between
the
various
conserved
genes
(
ORF1ab
,
spike
,
envelope
,
membrane
and
nucleocapsid
)
and
downstream
to
nucleocapsid
gene
in
different
coronavirus
lineages
.
Phylogenetically
,
three
genera
,
Alphacoronavirus
,
Betacoronavirus
and
Gammacoronavirus
,
with
Betacoronavirus
consisting
of
subgroups
A
,
B
,
C
and
D
,
exist
.
A
fourth
genus
,
Deltacoronavirus
,
which
includes
bulbul
coronavirus
HKU11
,
thrush
coronavirus
HKU12
and
munia
coronavirus
HKU13
,
is
emerging
.
Molecular
clock
analysis
using
various
gene
loci
revealed
that
the
time
of
most
recent
common
ancestor
of
human/civet
SARS
related
coronavirus
to
be
1999-2002
,
with
estimated
substitution
rate
of
410
-4
to
210
-2
substitutions
per
site
per
year
.
Recombination
in
coronaviruses
was
most
notable
between
different
strains
of
murine
hepatitis
virus
(
MHV
)
,
between
different
strains
of
infectious
bronchitis
virus
,
between
MHV
and
bovine
coronavirus
,
between
feline
coronavirus
(
FCoV
)
type
I
and
canine
coronavirus
generating
FCoV
type

HKU1
(
HCoV-HKU1
)
.
Codon
usage
bias
in
coronaviruses
were
observed
,
with
HCoV-HKU1
showing
the
most
extreme
bias
,
and
cytosine
deamination
and
selection
of
CpG
suppressed
clones
are
the
two
major
independent
biological
forces
that
shape
such
codon
usage
bias
in
coronaviruses
.
Background
:
Severe
acute
respiratory
syndrome
(
SARS
)
caused
a
large
outbreak
of
pneumonia
in
Beijing
,
China
,
in
2003
.
Reverse
transcriptase
polymerase
chain
reaction
(
RT-PCR
)
was
used
to
detect
and
quantify
SARS-CoV
in
934
sera
and
self-collected
throat
washes
and
fecal
samples
from
271
patients
with
laboratory-confirmed
SARS
managed
at
a
single
institution
.
Results
:
SARS-CoV
detection
rates
in
sera
were
highest
in
the
first
9
days
of
illness
,
whereas
detection
was
highest
in
throat
washes
5-14
days
after
onset
of
symptoms
.
The
highest
SARS-CoV
RT-PCR
rates
(
70.4-86.3
%
)
and
viral
loads
(
log
10
4.5-6.1
)
were
seen
in
fecal
samples
collected
2-4
weeks
after
the
onset
of
clinical
illness
.
Fecal
samples
were
frequently
SARS-CoV
RT-PCR
positive
beyond
40
days
,
and
occasional
sera
still
had
SARS-CoV
detected
after
3
weeks
of
illness
.
In
the
context
of
an
extensive
outbreak
with
major
pressure
on
hospital
resources
,
patient
self-collected
samples
are
an
alternative
to
nasopharyngeal
aspirates
for
laboratory
confirmation
of
SARS-CoV
infection
.
While
novel
picornaviruses
are
being
discovered
in
rodents
,
their
host
range
and
pathogenicity
are
largely
unknown
.
We
identified
two
novel
picornaviruses
,
rosavirus
B
from
the
street
rat
,
Norway
rat
,
and
rosavirus
C
from
five
different
wild
rat
species
(
chestnut
spiny
rat
,
greater
bandicoot
rat
,
Indochinese
forest
rat
,
roof
rat
and
Coxing
's
white-bellied
rat
)
in
China
.
Analysis
of
13
complete
genome
sequences
showed
that
``
Rosavirus
B
''
and
``
Rosavirus
C
''
represent
two
potentially
novel
picornavirus
species
infecting
different
rodents
.
Though
being
most
closely
related
to
rosavirus
A
,
rosavirus
B
and
C
possessed
distinct
protease
cleavage
sites
and
variations
in
Yn-Xm-AUG
sequence
in
5'UTR
and
myristylation
site
in
VP4
.
Anti-rosavirus
B
VP1
antibodies
were
detected
in
Norway
rats
,
whereas
anti-rosavirus
C
VP1
and
neutralizing
antibodies
were
detected
in
Indochinese
forest
rats
and
Coxing
's
white-bellied
rats
.
While
the
highest
prevalence
was
observed
in
Coxing
's
white-bellied
rats
by
RT-PCR
,
the
detection
of
rosavirus
C
from
different
rat
species
suggests
potential
interspecies
transmission
.
Rosavirus
C
isolated
from
3T3
cells
causes
multisystemic
diseases
in
a
mouse
model
,
with
high
viral
loads
and
positive
viral
antigen
expression
in
organs
of
infected
mice
after
oral
or
intracerebral
inoculation
.
Histological
examination
revealed
alveolar
fluid
exudation
,
interstitial
infiltration
,
alveolar
fluid
exudate
and
wall
thickening
in
lungs
,
and
hepatocyte
degeneration
and
lymphocytic/monocytic
inflammatory
infiltrates
with
giant
cell
formation
in
liver
sections
of
sacrificed
mice
.
Since
rosavirus
A2
has
been
detected
in
fecal
samples
of
children
,
further
studies
should
elucidate
the
pathogenicity
and
emergence
potential
of
different
rosaviruses
.
We
identified
two
novel
picornaviruses
,
rosavirus
B
and
C
,
infecting
street
and
wild
rats
respectively
in
China
.
While
rosavirus
B
was
detected
from
Norway
rats
,
rosavirus
C
was
detected
from
five
different
wild
rat
species
(
chestnut
spiny
rat
,
greater
bandicoot
rat
,
Indochinese
forest
rat
,
roof
rat
and
Coxing
's
white-bellied
rat
)
by
RT-PCR
.
Anti-rosavirus
B
antibodies
were
detected
in
Norway
rats
,
whereas
anti-rosavirus
C
antibodies
were
detected
in
Indochinese
forest
rats
and
Coxing
's
white-bellied
rats
,
supporting
potential
interspecies
transmission
of
rosavirus
C.
Genome
analysis
supported
the
classification
of
rosavirus
B
and
C
as
two
novel
picornavirus
species
,
with
genome
features
distinct
from
rosavirus
A.
Rosavirus
C
isolated
from
3T3
cells
causes
multisystemic
diseases
in
a
mouse
model
,
with
viruses
and
pathologies
detected
in
various
organs
of
infected
mice
after
oral
or
intracerebral
inoculation
.
Our
results
extend
our
knowledge
on
the
host
range
and
pathogenicity
of
rodent
picornaviruses
.
Novel
Rosavirus
in
Rodents
A
total
of
2450
respiratory
and
alimentary
samples
from
1232
rodents
of
six
different
species
were
obtained
(
Table

)
.
Initial
screening
by
RT-PCR
for
a
159-bp
fragment
of
3D
pol
gene
of
picornaviruses
was
positive
in
18
respiratory
and
24
alimentary
samples
from
37
rodents
of
six
different

.
The
sequences
from
these
positive

had
<
84
%
aa
identities
to
the
corresponding
segments
of
3D
pol
genes
of
known
picornaviruses
,
suggesting
the
presence
of
potential
novel
picornaviruses
.
Subsequent
RT-PCR
using
specific
primers
targeting
these
potential
novel
picornaviruses
on
the
2450
samples
was
positive
in
62
respiratory
and
70
alimentary
samples
from
92
rodents
.
The
sequences
from
these
132
samples
had
<
86
%
aa
identities
to
the
corresponding
segments
of
3D
pol
genes
of
known
picornaviruses
,
being
most
closely
related
to
Rosavirus
A
.
Moreover
,
these
sequences
fell
into
two
distinct
clusters
,
one
formed
by
sequences
from
wild
rodents
of
five
different

from
Hong
Kong
(

)
(

.
This
suggested
the
presence
of
two
potentially
novel
picornavirus
species
,
``
Rosavirus
B
''
and
``

``
Viral

were
only
detected
from
the

Editorial
Background
:
The
public
health
workforce
(
PHW
)
is
a
key
component
of
a
country
's
public
health
system
.
Since
the
outbreak
of
SARS
(
severe
acute
respiratory
syndrome
)
in
2003
,
the
scale
of
PHW
in
China
has
been
continuously
expanding
,
but
policymakers
and
researchers
still
focus
on
the
distribution
of
public
health
personnel
,
especially
the
regional
inequality
in
such
distribution
.
We
aimed
to
identify
the
root
cause
of
PHW
inequality
by
decomposing
different
geographical
units
in
China
.
Methods
:
This
study
was
based
on
data
from
a
nationwide
survey
,
which
included
2712
county-level
data
.
The
distribution
of
the
PHW
in
geographical
units
was
evaluated
by
the
Gini
coefficient
and
Theil
T
index
,
and
inequalities
at
regional
,
provincial
,
and
municipal
levels
were
decomposed
to
identify
the
root
causes
of
inequalities
in
the
PHW
.
Additionally
,
the
contextual
factors
affecting
the
distribution
of
the
PHW
were
determined
through
regression
analysis
.
Results
:
The
overall
inequality
results
show
that
health
professional
and
field
epidemiological
investigators
faced
worse
inequality
than
the
staff
.
In
particular
,
field
epidemiological
investigators
had
a
Gini
coefficient
close
to
0.4
.

showed
that
within-region
inequalities
accounted
for
98.5
%
or
more
of
overall
inter-county
inequality
in
the
distribution
of
all

categories
;
provincial
decomposition
showed
that
at
least
74
%
of
inequality
is
still
distributed
within
provinces
;
the
overall
contribution
of
within-municipal
inequality
and
between-municipal
inequality
was
basically
the
same
.
Further
,
the
contextual
factor
that
influenced
betweenmunicipality
and
within-municipality
inequality
for
all
three
categories
of
PHWs
was
the

Per

had
a
similar
effect
,
except
for

of

and
within-municipality
inequality
of
field

investigators
.
Conclusions
:
The
successive
decomposition
showed
that
inequality
is
mainly
concentrated
in
counties
at
the
within-province
and
within-municipal
levels
.
This
study
clearly
suggests
that
the
government
,
especially
the
municipal
government
at
the
provincial
level
,
should
increase
financial
investment

enhance
their

improve
the
salary
of

Here
,
we
report
the
anti-human
immunodeficiency
virus
(
HIV
)
potency
and
underlying
mechanisms
of
a

)
.
Our
findings
showed
that
PT-1
exhibited
highly
potent
effects
against
a
diverse
group
of
HIV
type
1
(
HIV-1
)
strains
and
displayed
low
cytotoxicity
and
genotoxicity
.
The
time-addition
assay
revealed
that
PT-1
acted
at
an
early
stage
of
infection
,
and
these
findings
were
supported
by
the
observation
that
PT-1
had
more
potency
against
Env-pseudotyped
virus
than
vesicular
stomatitis
virus
glycoprotein
(
VSVG
)
pseudotyped
virus
.
Surface
plasmon
resonance
binding
assays
and
flow

analysis
showed
that
PT-1
blocked
the
gp120
binding
site
in
the
CD4
receptor
.
Moreover
,
PT-1
bound
directly
to
gp41
NHR
(
N36
peptide
)
,
thereby
interrupting
the
core
bundle
formation
of
gp41
.
In
conclusion
,
our
data
suggested
that
PT-1
may
be
developed
as
a
new
anti-HIV-1
agent
through
its
effects
on
entry

.
The
purpose
of
this
case
study
is
to
show
that
outputs
from
situational
and
intervention
analyses
,
when
combined
using
a
statistical
decision
model
(
specifically
a
Bayesian
decision
network
)
,
can
provide
recommendations
on
response
options
(
including
uncertainty
)
.
For
the
intervention
analysis
,
we
used
our
previously
published
intervention
model
of
targeted
antiviral
distribution
strategies
[
1
]
.
This
model
and
its
findings
form
the
basis
for
Australia
's
current
response
plan
[
2
]
.
The
model
allows
for
:
the
use
of
antivirals
for
treatment
of
cases
and
postexposure
prophylaxis
of
contacts
;
differential
risks
of
severe
disease
outcomes
and
differential
benefits
of
treatment
across
population
subgroups
;
and
health
system
capacity
constraints
.
The
most
recent
version
of
this
model
is
described
by
Moss
and
colleagues
[

]
and
it
builds
on
a
larger
body
of
work
,
conducted
over
a
15-year
period
,
which
has
focused
on

We
considered
three
different

.
Decision

outcomes
were
compared
for
two
hypothetical
pandemics
with
distinct
pandemic

:
one
of
severe

)
and
another
of
milder

.
The
decision
options
for
Pandemics
A
and
B
,
given
the
evidence
,
were
assessed
using
a
Bayesian
decision
network
.
It
is
important
to
note
that
the
decision
model
presented
in
this

is
for
demonstrative
purposes
only

Chronic
infections
represent
a
continuous
battle
between
the
host
's
immune
system
and
pathogen
replication
.
Many
protozoan
parasites
have
evolved
a
cyst
lifecycle
stage
that
provides
it
with
increased
protection
from
environmental
degradation
as
well
as
endogenous
host
mechanisms
of
attack
.
In
the
case
of
Toxoplasma
gondii
,
these
cysts
are
predominantly
found
in
the
immune
protected
brain
making
clearance
of
the
parasite
more
difficult
and
resulting
in
a
lifelong
infection
.
Currently
,
little
is
known
about
the
nature
of
the
immune
response
stimulated
by
the
presence
of
these
cysts
or
how
they
are
able
to
propagate
.
Here
we
establish
a
novel
chitinase-dependent
mechanism
of
cyst
control
in
the
infected
brain
.
Despite
a
dominant
Th1
immune
response
during
Toxoplasma
infection
there
exists
a
population
of
alternatively
activated
macrophages
(
AAMØ
)
in
the
infected
CNS
.
These
cells
are
capable
of
cyst
lysis
via
the
production
of
AMCase
as
revealed
by
live
imaging
,
and
this
chitinase
is
necessary
for
protective
immunity
within
the
CNS
.
These
data
demonstrate
chitinase
activity
in
the
brain
in
response
to
a
protozoan
pathogen
and
provide
a
novel
mechanism
to
facilitate
cyst
clearance
during
chronic
infections
.
West
Nile
virus
(
WNV
)
is
a
human
pathogen
of
significant
medical
importance
with
close
to
40,000
cases
of
encephalitis
and
more
than
1,600
deaths
reported
in
the
US
alone
since
its
first
emergence
in
New
York
in
1999
.
Previous
studies
identified
a
motif
in
the
beginning
of
non-structural
gene
NS2A
of
encephalitic
flaviviruses
including
WNV
which
induces
programmed
21
ribosomal
frameshift
(
PRF
)
resulting
in
production
of
an
additional
NS
protein
NS19
.
We
have
previously
demonstrated
that
mutant
WNV
with
abolished
PRF
was
attenuated
in
mice
.
Here
we
have
extended
our
previous
observations
by
showing
that
PRF
does
not
appear
to
have
a
significant
role
in
virus
replication
,
virion
formation
,
and
viral
spread
in
several
cell
lines
in
vitro
.
However
,
we
have
also
shown
that
PRF
induces
an
over
production
of
structural
proteins
over
nonstructural
proteins
in
virus-infected
cells
and
that
mutation
abolishing
PRF
is
present
in
,11
%
of
the
wild
type
virus
population
.
In
vivo
experiments
in
house
sparrows
using
wild
type
and
PRF
mutant
of
New
York
99
strain
of
WNV
viruses
showed
some
attenuation
for
the
PRF
mutant
virus
.
Moreover
,
PRF
mutant
of
Kunjin
strain
of
WNV
showed
significant
decrease
compared
to
wild
type
virus
infection
in
dissemination
of
the
virus
from
the
midgut
through
the
haemocoel
,
and
ultimately
the
capacity
of
infected
mosquitoes
to
transmit
virus
.
Thus
our
results
demonstrate
an
important
role
for
PRF
in
regulating
expression
of
viral
genes
and
consequently
virus
replication
in
avian
and
mosquito
hosts
.
The
replication
enzyme
of
RNA
viruses
must
preferentially
recognize
their
RNAs
in
an
environment
that
contains
an
abundance
of
cellular
RNAs
.
The
factors
responsible
for
specific
RNA
recognition
are
not
well
understood
,
in
part
because
viral
RNA
synthesis
takes
place
within
enzyme
complexes
associated
with
modified
cellular
membrane
compartments
.
Recombinant
RNA-dependent
RNA
polymerases
(
RdRps
)
from
the
human
norovirus
and
the
murine
norovirus
(
MNV
)
were
found
to
preferentially
recognize
RNA
segments
that
contain
the
promoter
and
a
short
template
sequence
for
subgenomic
RNA
synthesis
.
Both
the
promoter
and
template
sequence
contribute
to
stable
RdRp
binding
,
accurate
initiation
of
the
subgenomic
RNAs
and
efficient
RNA
synthesis
.
Using
a
method
that
combines
RNA
crosslinking
and
mass
spectrometry
,
residues
near
the
template
channel
of
the
MNV
RdRp
were
found
to
contact
the
hairpin
RNA
motif
.
Mutations
in
the
hairpin
contact
site
in
the
MNV
RdRp
reduced
MNV
replication
and
virus
production
in
cells
.
This
work
demonstrates
that
the
specific
recognition
of
the
norovirus
subgenomic
promoter
is
through
binding
by
the
viral
RdRp
.
Background
:
There
is
widespread
interest
in
the
use
of
innate
immune
modulators
as
a
defense
strategy
against
infectious
pathogens
.
Using
rotavirus
as
a
model
system
,
we
developed
a
cell-based
,
moderate-throughput
screening
(
MTS
)
assay
to
identify
compounds
that
reduce
rotavirus
infectivity
in
vitro
,
toward
a
long-term
goal
of
discovering
immunomodulatory
agents
that
enhance
innate
responses
to
viral
infection
.
A
natural
product
library
consisting
of
280
compounds
was
screened
in
the
assay
and
15
compounds
that
significantly
reduced
infectivity
without
cytotoxicity
were
identified
.
Time
course
analysis
of
four
compounds
with
previously
characterized
effects
on
inflammatory
gene
expression
inhibited
replication
with
pre-treatment
times
as
minimal
as
2
hours
.
Two
of
these
four
compounds
,
α-mangostin
and
18-β-glycyrrhetinic
acid
,
activated
NFκB
and
induced
IL-8
secretion
.
The
assay
is
adaptable
to
other
virus
systems
,
and
amenable
to
full
automation
and
adaptation
to
a
high-throughput
format
.
Conclusion
:
Identification
of
several
compounds
with
known
effects
on
inflammatory
and
antiviral
gene
expression
that
confer
resistance
to
rotavirus
infection
in
vitro
suggests
the
assay
is
an
appropriate
platform
for
discovery
of
compounds
with
potential
to
amplify
innate
antiviral
responses
.
Due
to
their
ability
to
inhibit
viral
DNA
or
RNA
replication
,
nucleoside
analogues
have
been
used
for
decades
as
potent
antiviral
therapeutics
.
However
,
one
of
the
major
limitations
of
nucleoside
analogues
is
the
development
of
antiviral
resistance
.
In
that
regard
,
flexible
nucleoside
analogues
known
as
``
fleximers
''
have
garnered
attention
over
the
years
due
to
their
ability
to
survey
different
amino
acids
in
enzyme
binding
sites
,
thus
overcoming
the
potential
development
of
antiviral
resistance
.
Acyclic
fleximers
have
previously
demonstrated
antiviral
activity
against
numerous
viruses
including
Middle
East
Respiratory
Syndrome
coronavirus
(
MERS-CoV
)
,
Ebola
virus
(
EBOV
)
,
and
,
most
recently
,
flaviviruses
such
as
Dengue
(
DENV
)
and
Yellow
Fever
Virus
(
YFV
)
.
Due
to
these
interesting
results
,
a
Structure
Activity
Relationship
(
SAR
)
study
was
pursued
in
order
to
analyze
the
effect
of
the
pyrimidine
functional
group
and
acyl
protecting
group
on
antiviral
activity
,
cytotoxicity
,
and
conformation
.
The
results
of
those
studies
are
presented
herein
.
Humans
may
be
infected
by
different
influenza
A
viruses-seasonal
,
pandemic
,
and

differ
in
presentation
from
mild
upper
respiratory

to
severe

sometimes
fatal

with
extra-respiratory

.
Differences
in
spatial
and
temporal
dynamics
of
these

are
poorly
understood

pH1N1
infection
also
peaked
at
1
dpi
,
but
occurred
at
similar
levels
throughout
the
respiratory
tract
.
H5N1
infection
occurred
predominantly
in
the
alveoli
,
where
it
peaked
for
a
longer
period
,
from
1
to
3
dpi
.
The
associated
lesions
followed
the
same
spatial
distribution
as
virus
infection
,
but
their
severity
peaked
between
1
and
6
days
later
.
Neutrophil
and
monocyte
counts
in
peripheral
blood
correlated
with
inflammatory
cell
influx
in
the
alveoli
.

to
measure
lower
respiratory

relative
lung

allowed
the
best
quantitative

groups
.
There
was
extra-respiratory
spread
to
more
tissues-including
the
central
nervous
system-for
H5N1
infection
than
for
pH1N1
infection
,
and
to
none
for
H3N2
infection
.
This
study
shows
that
seasonal
,
pandemic
,
and
zoonotic
influenza
viruses
differ
strongly
in
the
spatial
and
temporal
dynamics
of

RNA
viruses
represent
the
most
abundant
group
of
viruses
and
are
dependent
on
the
host
cell
machinery
to
replicate
.
One
remarkable
feature
that
occurs
after
(
+
)
RNA
virus
entry
into
cells
is
the
remodeling
of
host
endomembranes
,
leading
to
the
formation
of
viral
replication
factories
.
Recently
,
rapid
progress
in
threedimensional
(
3D
)
imaging
technologies
,
such
as
electron
tomography
(
ET
)
and
focused
ion
beam-scanning
electron
microscopy
(
FIB-SEM
)
,
has
enabled
researchers
to
visualize
the
novel
membrane
structures
induced
by
viruses
at
high
resolution
.
These
3D
imaging
technologies
provide
new
mechanistic
insights
into
the
viral
infection
cycle
.
In
this
review
,
we
summarize
the
latest
reports
on
the
cellular
remodeling
that
occurs
during
plant
virus
infection
;
in
particular
,
we
focus
on
studies
that
provide
3D
architectural
information
on
viral
replication
factories
.
We
also
outline
the
mechanisms
underlying
the
formation
of
these
membranous
structures
and
discuss
possible
future
research
directions
.
Because
mass
gatherings
create
environments
conducive
for
infectious
disease
transmission
,
public
health
officials
may
recommend
postponing
or
canceling
large
gatherings
during
a
moderate
or
severe
pandemic
.
Despite
these
recommendations
,
limited
empirical
information
exists
on
the
frequency
and
characteristics
of
mass
gathering-related
respiratory
disease
outbreaks
occurring
in
the
United
States
.
We
conducted
a
systematic
literature
review
to
identify
articles
about
mass
gatheringrelated
respiratory
disease
outbreaks
occurring
in
the
United
States
from
2005
to
2014
.
A
standard
form
was
used
to
abstract
information
from
relevant
articles
identified
from
six
medical
,
behavioral
and
social
science
literature

.
We
also
analyzed
data
from
the
National
Outbreaks
Reporting
System
(
NORS
)
,
maintained
by
the
Centers
for
Disease
Control
and
Prevention
since
2009
,
to
estimate
the
frequency
of
mass
gathering-related
respiratory
disease
outbreaks
reported
to
the
system
.
We
identified
21
published
articles
describing
72
mass
gathering-related
respiratory
disease
outbreaks
.
Of
these
72
,
40

)
were
associated
with
agriculture

and

.
Outbreaks
of
measles
(

)
and
mumps
(
n
=

)
were
linked
to
the
international
importation
of
disease
.
Between
2009
and
2013
,
1,114
outbreaks
were
reported
to
NORS
,
including
96
respiratory
disease
outbreaks
due
to
Legionella
.
None
of
these
legionellosis
outbreaks
was
linked
to
a
mass
gathering
according
to
available
data
.
Human
populations
worldwide
are
increasingly
confronted
with
infectious
diseases
and
antimicrobial
resistance
spreading
faster
and
appearing
more
frequently
.
Knowledge
regarding
their
occurrence
and
worldwide
transmission
is
important
to
control
outbreaks
and
prevent
epidemics
.
Here
,
we
performed
shotgun
sequencing
of
toilet
waste
from
18
international
airplanes
arriving
in
Copenhagen
,
Denmark
,
from
nine
cities
in
three
world

.
An

(
14.8

)
of
raw
Illumina
paired

was
generated
,
cleaned
,
trimmed
and
mapped
against
reference

databases
for

and
antimicrobial
resistance
genes
.
An
average
of
106,839
(
0.06

were
assigned
to
resistance
genes
with
genes
encoding
resistance
to
tetracycline
,
macrolide
and
beta-lactam
resistance
genes
as
the
most
abundant
in
all
samples
.
We
found
significantly
higher
abundance
and
diversity
of
genes
encoding
antimicrobial
resistance
,
including
critical
important
resistance
(

carried
on

from
South
Asia
compared
to

.
Presence
of
Salmonella
enterica
and
norovirus
were
also
detected
in
higher
amounts
from
South
Asia
,
whereas
Clostridium
difficile
was
most
abundant
in
samples
from
North

.
Our
study
provides
a
first
step
towards
a
potential
novel
strategy
for
global
surveillance
enabling
simultaneous
detection
of
multiple
human
health
threatening
genetic
elements
,
infectious
agents
and
resistance
genes
.
Globally
,
infectious
diseases
are
the
cause
of
about
22
%
of
all
human
deaths
1
.
Due
to
increasing
population
density
,
increasing
use
of
antimicrobial
agents
,
disruption
of
wildlife
habitats
,
and
an
increase
in
global
travel
and
trade
this
number
has
been
estimated
to
increase
in
coming
years
2,3
.
Rapid
global
surveillance
systems
for
early
detection
of
worldwide
spread
of
zoonotic
and
human
pathogens
would
enable
outbreak
control
and
epidemic
prevention
4,5
.
In
addition
to
the
direct
severe
consequences
for
human
health
,
infectious
diseases
may
cause
an
increased
financial
burden
on
health
systems
and
may
imply
restriction
on
travel
,
trade
,
etc
.
Global
spread
of
antimicrobial
resistance
in
bacterial
pathogens
is
another
major
threat
against
human
health
,
yet
we
do
n't
know
much
about
how
these
genes

Current
international

is
mainly
based
on

a
glycoprotein
of
the
primary
innate
immune-defense
system
of
mammals
present
in
milk
and
other
mucosal
secretions
.
This
protein
of
the
transferrin
family
has
broad
antimicrobial
properties
by
depriving
pathogens
from
iron
,
or
disrupting
their
plasma
membranes
through
its
highly
cationic
charge
.
Noteworthy
,
Lf
also
exhibits
immunomodulatory
activities
performing
up-and
down-regulation
of
innate
and
adaptive
immune
cells
,
contributing
to
the
homeostasis
in
mucosal
surfaces
exposed
to
myriad
of
microbial
agents
,
such
as
the
gastrointestinal
and
respiratory
tracts
.
Although
the
inflammatory
process
is
essential
for
the
control
of
invasive
infectious
agents
,
the
development
of
an
exacerbated
or
chronic
inflammation
results
in
tissue
damage
with
life-threatening
consequences
.
In
this
review
,
we
highlight
recent
findings
in
in
vitro
and
in
vivo
models
of
the
gut
,
lung
,
oral
cavity
,
mammary
gland
,
and
liver

that
provide
experimental
evidence
supporting
the
therapeutic
role
of
human
and
bovine
Lf
in
promoting
some
parameters

and
protecting
against
the
deleterious
effects
of
bacterial

Thus

paves
the
way

more
effective
design

laboratory
diagnosis
of
persons
suspected

is
important
for

and
disease
management
.
In
addition
,
monitoring
molecular
changes
in
the

can
help
elucidate
chains
of
transmission
and
identify
mutations
that
might
influence
virus
transmission
efficiency
.
This
was
illustrated
by
a
recent
laboratory
investigation
we
conducted
on
an
imported
MERS-CoV
case
in
Greece
.
Two
oropharyngeal
swab
specimens
were
collected
on
the
1
st
and
2
nd
day
of
patient
hospitalization
and
tested
using
two
real-time
RT-PCR
(
rRT-PCR
)
assays
targeting
the
UpE
and
Orf-1a
regions
of
the
MERS-CoV
genome
and
RT-PCR
and
partial
sequencing
of
RNA-dependent
RNA
polymerase
and
nucleocapsid
genes
.
Serum
specimens
were
also
collected
and
serological
test
were
performed
.
Results
from
the
first
swab
sample
were
inconclusive
while
the
second
swab
was
strongly
positive
for
MERS-CoV
RNA
by
rRT-PCR
and
confirmed
positive
by
RT-PCR
and
partial
gene
sequencing
.
Positive
serologic
test
results
further
confirmed
MERS-CoV
infection
.
Full-length
nucleocapsid
and
spike
gene
coding
sequences
were
later
obtained
from
the
positive
swab
sample
.
Phylogenetic
analysis
revealed
that
the
virus
was
closely
related
to
recent
human-derived
MERS-CoV
strains
obtained
in
Jeddah
and
Makkah
,
Saudi
Arabia
,
in
April
2014
and
dromedary
camels
in
Saudi
Arabia
and
Qatar
.
These
findings
were
consistent
with
the
patient
's
history
.
We
also
identified
a
unique
amino
acid
substitution
in
the
spike
receptor
binding
domain
that
may
have
implications
for
receptor
binding
efficiency
.
Our
initial
inconclusive
rRT-PCR
results
highlight
the
importance
of
collecting
multiple
specimens
from
suspect
MERS-CoV
cases
and
particularly
specimens
from
the
lower
respiratory
tract

astrovirus
pose
a
risk
for
zoonotic
infection
.
Here
,
novel
astroviruses
were
identified
from
goslings
with
recent
epidemic
gout
disease
in
China
.
A
virus
,
designated
as
GD
,
was
efficiently
isolated
from
a
diseased
gosling
using
LMH
cells
.
Genome
of
GD
amplified
using
5′
and
3′
RACE
was
7183nt
in
full
length
.
Sequence
analysis
revealed
the
genome
of
GD
was
<
60.8
%
homology
with
others
deposited
in
Genbank
.
Moreover
,
GD
could
be
neutralized
by
goose
convalescent
sera
,
and
the
gout
associated
symptom
in
goslings
could
be
reproduced
by
GD
infection
.
Our
data
demonstrated
the
goose
astrovirus
could
be
one
of
the
causative
agents
of
the
ongoing
gosling
gout
disease
in
China
.
The
identification
of
the
goose
astrovirus
not
only
diversified
the
astrovirus
species
,
but
also
broadened
the
disease
patterns
caused
by
astroviruses
.
The
respiratory
tract
is
constantly
exposed
to
the
external
environment
,
and
therefore
,
must
be
equipped
to
respond
to
and
eliminate
pathogens
.
Viral
clearance
and
resolution
of
infection
requires
a
complex
,
multi-faceted
response
initiated
by
resident
respiratory
tract
cells
and
innate
immune
cells
and
ultimately
resolved
by
adaptive
immune
cells
.
Although
an
effective
immune
response
to
eliminate
viral
pathogens
is
essential
,
a
prolonged
or
exaggerated
response
can
damage
the
respiratory
tract
.
Immune-mediated
pulmonary
damage
is
manifested
clinically
in
a
variety
of
ways
depending
on
location
and
extent
of
injury
.
Thus
,
the
antiviral
immune
response
represents
a
balancing
act
between
the
elimination
of
virus
and
immune-mediated
pulmonary
injury
.
In
this
review
,
we
highlight
major
components
of
the
host
response
to
acute
viral
infection
and
their
role
in
contributing
to
mitigating
respiratory
damage
.
We
also
briefly
describe
common
clinical
manifestations
of
respiratory
viral
infection
and
morphological
correlates
.
The
continuing
threat
posed
by
pandemic
influenza
as
well
as
the
emergence
of
novel
respiratory
viruses
also
capable
of
producing
severe
acute
lung
injury
such
as
SARS-CoV
,
MERS-CoV
,
and
enterovirus
D68
,
highlights
the
need
for
an
understanding
of
the
immune
mechanisms
that
contribute
to
virus
elimination
and
immunemediated
injury
.
Background
:
Influenza
A
virus
(
IAV
)
infection
primarily
targets
respiratory
epithelial
cells
and
produces
clinical
outcomes
ranging
from
mild
upper
respiratory
infection
to
severe
pneumonia
.
Recent
studies
have
shown
the
importance
of
lung
antioxidant
defense
systems
against
injury
by
IAV
.
Nuclear
factor-erythroid
2
related
factor
2
(
Nrf2
)
activates
the
majority
of
antioxidant
genes
.
Methods
:
Alveolar
type
II
(
ATII
)
cells
and
alveolar
macrophages
(
AM
)
were
isolated
from
human
lungs
not
suitable
for
transplantation
and
donated
for
medical
research
.
In
some
studies
ATII
cells
were
transdifferentiated
to
alveolar
type
I-like
(
ATI-like
)
cells
.
Alveolar
epithelial
cells
were
infected
with
A/PR/8/34
(
PR8
)
virus
.
We
analyzed
PR8
virus
production
,
influenza
A
nucleoprotein
levels
,
ROS
generation
and
expression
of
antiviral
genes
.
Immunocytofluorescence
was
used
to
determine
Nrf2
translocation
and
western
blotting
to
detect
Nrf2
,
HO-1
and
caspase
1
and
3
cleavage
.
We
also
analyzed
ingestion
of
PR8
virus
infected
apoptotic
ATII
cells
by
AM
,
cytokine
levels
by
ELISA
,
glutathione
levels
,
necrosis
and
apoptosis
by
TUNEL
assay
.
Moreover
,
we
determined
the
critical
importance
of
Nrf2
using
adenovirus
Nrf2
(
AdNrf2
)
or
Nrf2
siRNA
to
overexpress
or
knockdown
Nrf2
,
respectively
.
Results
:
We
found
that
IAV
induced
oxidative
stress
,
cytotoxicity
and
apoptosis
in
ATI-like
and
ATII
cells
.
We
also
found
that
AM
can
ingest
PR8
virus-induced
apoptotic
ATII
cells
(
efferocytosis
)
but
not
viable
cells
,
whereas
ATII
cells
did
not
ingest
these
apoptotic
cells
.
PR8
virus
increased
ROS
production
,
Nrf2
,
HO-1
,
Mx1
and
OAS1
expression
and
Nrf2
translocation
to
the
nucleus
.
Nrf2
knockdown
with
siRNA
sensitized
ATI-like
cells
and
ATII
cells
to
injury
induced
by
IAV
and
overexpression
of
Nrf2
with
AdNrf2
protected
these
cells
.
Furthermore
,
Nrf2
overexpression
followed
by
infection
with
PR8
virus
decreased
virus
replication
,
influenza
A
nucleoprotein
expression
,
antiviral
response
and
oxidative
stress
.
However
,
AdNrf2
did
not
increase
IFN-λ1
(
IL-29
)
levels
.
Our
results
indicate
that
IAV
induces
alveolar
epithelial
injury
and
that
Nrf2
protects
these
cells
from
the
cytopathic
effects
of
IAV
likely
by
increasing
the
expression
of
antioxidant
genes
.
Identifying
the
pathways
involved
in
protecting
cells
from
injury
during
influenza
infection
may
be
particularly
important
for
developing
new
therapeutic
strategies
.
Objectives
:
Severe
influenza
can
lead
to
Intensive
Care
Unit
(
ICU
)
admission
.
We
explored
whether
ICU
data
reflect
influenza
like
illness
(
ILI
)
activity
in
the
general
population
,
and
whether
ICU
respiratory
infections
can
predict
influenza
epidemics
.
Methods
:
We
calculated
the
time
lag
and
correlation
between
ILI
incidence
(
from
ILI
sentinel
surveillance
,
based
on
general
practitioners
(
GP
)
consultations
)
and
percentages
of
ICU
admissions
with
a
respiratory
infection
(
from
the
Dutch
National
Intensive
Care
Registry
)
over
the
years
2003-2011
.
In
addition
,
ICU
data
of
the
first
three
years
was
used
to
build
three
regression
models
to
predict
the
start
and
end
of
influenza
epidemics
in
the
years
thereafter
,
one
to
three
weeks
ahead
.
The
predicted
start
and
end
of
influenza
epidemics
were
compared
with
observed
start
and
end
of
such
epidemics
according
to
the
incidence
of
ILI
.
Results
:
Peaks
in
respiratory
ICU
admissions
lasted
longer
than
peaks
in
ILI
incidence
rates
.
Increases
in
ICU
admissions
occurred
on
average
two
days
earlier
compared
to
ILI
.
Predicting
influenza
epidemics
one
,
two
,
or
three
weeks
ahead
yielded
positive
predictive
values
ranging
from
0.52
to
0.78
,
and
sensitivities
from
0.34
to
0.51
.
At
a
dose
of
0.3
mg/kg
,
it
could
protect
all
tested
rats
from
a
lethal
dose
of
LeTx
.
Even
administration
of
0.6
mg/kg
hmPA6
48
h
before
LeTx
challenge
protected
all
tested
rats
.
The
results
indicate
that
hmPA6
is
a
potential
candidate
for
clinical
application
in
anthrax
treatment
.
The
virus
family
Flaviviridae
encompasses
several
viruses
,
including
(
re
)
emerging
viruses
which
cause
widespread
morbidity
and
mortality
throughout
the
world
.
Members
of
this
virus
family
are
positive-strand
RNA
viruses
and
replicate
their
genome
in
close
association
with
reorganized
intracellular
host
cell
membrane
compartments
.
This
evolutionarily
conserved
strategy
facilitates
efficient
viral
genome
replication
and
contributes
to
evasion
from
host
cell
cytosolic
defense
mechanisms
.
We
have
previously
described
the
identification
of
a
small-compound
inhibitor
,
K22
,
which
exerts
a
potent
antiviral
activity
against
a
broad
range
of
coronaviruses
by
targeting
membranebound
viral
RNA
replication
.
To
analyze
the
antiviral
spectrum
of
this
inhibitor
,
we
assessed
the
inhibitory
potential
of
K22
against
several
members
of
the
Flaviviridae
family
,
including
the
reemerging
Zika
virus
(
ZIKV
)
.
We
show
that
ZIKV
is
strongly
affected
by
K22
.
Time-of-addition
experiments
revealed
that
K22
acts
during
a
postentry
phase
of
the
ZIKV
life
cycle
,
and
combination
regimens
of
K22
together
with
ribavirin
(
RBV
)
or
interferon
alpha
(
IFN-␣
)
further
increased
the
extent
of
viral
inhibition
.
Ultrastructural
electron
microscopy
studies
revealed
severe
alterations
of
ZIKV-induced
intracellular
replication
compartments
upon
infection
of
K22-treated
cells
.
Importantly
,
the
antiviral
activity
of
K22
was
demonstrated
against
several
other
members
of
the
Flaviviridae
family
.
It
is
tempting
to
speculate
that
K22
exerts
its
broad
antiviral
activity
against
several
positivestrand
RNA
viruses
via
a
similar
mechanism
and
thereby
represents
an
attractive
candidate
for
development
as
a
panviral
inhibitor
.
To
identify
new
host
factors
that
modulate
the
replication
of
influenza
A
virus
,
we
performed
a
yeast
two-hybrid
screen
using
the
cytoplasmic
tail
of
matrix
protein
2
from
the
highly
pathogenic
H5N1
strain
.
The
screen
revealed
a
high-score
interaction
with
cyclin
D3
,
a
key
regulator
of
cell
cycle
early
G
1
phase
.
Interestingly
,
the
increase
in
virus
production
was
due
to
cyclin
D3
deficiency
per
se
and
not
merely
a
consequence
of
cell
cycle
deregulation
.
A
combined
knockdown
of
Ccnd3
and
Rb1
,
which
rescued
cell
cycle
progression
into
S
phase
,
failed
to
normalize
virus
production
.
Infection
by
influenza
A
virus
triggered
redistribution
of
cyclin
D3
from
the
nucleus
to
the
cytoplasm
,
followed
by
its
proteasomal
degradation
.
When
overexpressed
in
HEK
293T
cells
,
cyclin
D3
impaired
binding
of
M2
with
M1
,
which
is
essential
for
proper
assembly
of
progeny
virions
,
lending
further
support
to
its
role
as
a
putative
restriction
factor
.
Our
study
describes
the
identification
and
characterization
of
cyclin
D3
as
a
novel
interactor
of
influenza
A
virus
M2
protein
.
We
hypothesize
that
competitive
inhibition
of
M1-M2
interaction
by
cyclin
D3
impairs
infectious
virion
formation
and
results
in
attenuated
virus
production
.
In
addition
,
we
provide
mechanistic
insights
into
the
dynamic
interplay
of
influenza
virus
with
the
host
cell
cycle
machinery
during
infection
.
Background
:
Neurotropic
flaviviruses
such
as
tick-borne
encephalitis
virus
(
TBEV
)
,
Japanese
encephalitis
virus
(
JEV
)
,
West
Nile
virus
(
WNV
)
,
and
Zika
virus
(
ZIKV
)
are
causative
agents
of
severe
brain-related
diseases
including
meningitis
,
encephalitis
,
and
microcephaly
.
We
have
previously
shown
that
local
type
I
interferon
response
within
the
central
nervous
system
(
CNS
)
is
involved
in
the
protection
of
mice
against
tick-borne
flavivirus
infection
.
However
,
the
cells
responsible
for
mounting
this
protective
response
are
not
defined
.
Methods
:
Primary
astrocytes
were
isolated
from
wild-type
(
WT
)
and
interferon
alpha
receptor
knock
out
(
IFNAR
−/−
)
mice
and
infected
with
neurotropic
flaviviruses
.
Viral
replication
and
spread
,
IFN
induction
and
response
,
and
cellular
viability
were
analyzed
.
Transcriptional
levels
in
primary
astrocytes
treated
with
interferon
or
supernatant
from
virus-infected
cells
were
analyzed
by
RNA
sequencing
and
evaluated
by
different
bioinformatics
tools
.
Results
:
Here
,
we
show
that
astrocytes
control
viral
replication
of
different
TBEV
strains
,
JEV
,
WNV
,
and
ZIKV
.
In
contrast
to
fibroblast
,
astrocytes
mount
a
rapid
interferon
response
and
restrict
viral
spread
.
Furthermore
,
basal
expression
levels
of
key
interferon-stimulated
genes
are
high
in
astrocytes
compared
to
mouse
embryonic
fibroblasts
.
Bioinformatic
analysis
of
RNA-sequencing
data
reveals
that
astrocytes
have
established
a
basal
antiviral
state
which
contributes
to
the
rapid
viral
recognition
and
upregulation
of
interferons
.
The
most
highly
upregulated
pathways
in
neighboring
cells
were
linked
to
type
I
interferon
response
and
innate
immunity
.
The
restriction
in
viral
growth
was
dependent
on
interferon
signaling
,
since
loss
of
the
interferon
receptor
,
or
its
blockade
in
wild-type
cells
,
resulted
in
high
viral
replication
and
virus-induced
cytopathic
effects
.
Astrocyte
supernatant
from
TBEV-infected
cells
can
restrict
TBEV
growth
in
astrocytes
already
6
h
post
infection
,
the
effect
on
neurons
is
highly
reinforced
,
and
astrocyte
supernatant
from
3
h
post
infection
is
already
protective
.
Conclusions
:
These
findings
suggest
that
the
combination
of
an
intrinsic
constitutive
antiviral
response
and
the
fast
induction
of
type
I
IFN
production
by
astrocytes
play
an
important
role
in
self-protection
of
astrocytes
and
suppression
of
flavivirus
replication
in
the
CNS
.
Zika
virus
(
ZIKV
)
belongs
to
the
Flavivirus
genus
of
the
Flaviviridae
family
.
It
is
an
arbovirus
that
can
cause
congenital
abnormalities
and
is
sexually
transmissible
.
A
series
of
outbreaks
accompanied
by
unexpected
severe
clinical
complications
have
captured
medical
attention
to
further
characterize
the
clinical
features
of
congenital
ZIKV
syndrome
and
its
underlying
pathophysiological
mechanisms
.
Endoplasmic
reticulum
(
ER
)
and
ER-related
proteins
are
essential
in
ZIKV
genome
replication
.
This
review
highlights
the
subcellular
localization
of
ZIKV
to
the
ER
and
ZIKV
modulation
on
the
architecture
of
the
ER
.
This
review
also
discusses
ZIKV
interaction
with
ER
proteins
such
as
signal
peptidase
complex
subunit

(
SPCS1
)
,

Furthermore
,
the
review
covers
several
important
resulting
effects
of
ZIKV

to
the

cellular
processes
including

Pharmacological

Background
:
Infectious
bronchitis
virus
primarily
induces
a
disease
of
the
respiratory
system
,
different
IBV
strains
may
show
variable
tissue
tropisms
and
also
affect
the
oviduct
and
the
kidneys
.
Proventriculitis
was
also
associated
with
some
new
IBV
strains
.
Aim
of
this
study
was
to
investigate
by
immunohistochemistry
(
IHC
)
the
tissue
tropism
of
avian
infectious
bronchitis
virus
(
IBV
)
strain
M41
in
experimentally
infected
chicken
embryos
.
To
this
end
chicken
embryos
were
inoculated
in
the
allantoic
sac
with
10
3
EID
50
of
IBV
M41
at
10
days
of
age
.
At
48
,
72
,
and
120
h
postinoculation
(
PI
)
,
embryos
and
chorioallantoic
membranes
(
CAM
)
were
sampled
,
fixed
,
and
paraffin-wax
embedded
.
Allantoic
fluid
was
also
collected
and
titrated
in
chicken
embryo
kidney
cells
(
CEK
)
.
The
sensitivity
of
IHC
in
detecting
IBV
antigens
in
the
CAM
of
inoculated
eggs
matched
the
virus
reisolation
and
detection
in
CEK
.
Using
IHC
,
antigens
of
IBV
were
detected
in
nasal
epithelium
,
trachea
,
lung
,
spleen
,
myocardial
vasculature
,
liver
,
gastrointestinal
tract
,
kidney
,
skin
,
sclera
of
the
eye
,
spinal
cord
,
as
well
as
in
brain
neurons
of
the
inoculated
embryos
.
These
results
were
consistent
with
virus
isolation
and
denote
the
wide
tissue
tropism
of
IBV
M41
in
the
chicken
embryo
.
Most
importantly
,
we
found
infection
of
vasculature
and
smooth
muscle
of
the
proventriculus
which
has
not
seen
before
with
IBV
strain
M41
.
Conclusion
:
IHC
can
be
an
additional
useful
tool
for
diagnosis
of
IBV
infection
in
chickens
and
allows
further
studies
to
foster
a
deeper
understanding
of
the
pathogenesis
of
infections
with
IBV
strains
of
different
virulence
.
Moreover
,
these
results
underline
that
embryonic
tissues
in
addition
to
CAM
could
be
also
used
as
possible
source
to
generate
IBV
antigens
for
diagnostic
purposes
.
Guanine
(
G
)
-quadruplexes
(
G4s
)
are
unique
nucleic
acid
structures
that
are
formed
by
stacked
G-tetrads
in
G-rich
DNA
or
RNA
sequences
.
G4s
have
been
reported
to
play
significant
roles
in
various
cellular
events
in
both
macro-and
micro-organisms
.
The
identification
and
characterization
of
G4s
can
help
to
understand
their
different
biological
roles
and
potential
applications
in
diagnosis
and
therapy
.
In
addition
to
biophysical
and
biochemical
methods
to
interrogate
G4
formation
,
G4
fluorescent
turn-on
ligands
can
be
used
to
target
and
visualize
G4
formation
both
in
vitro
and
in
cells
.
Here
,
we
review
several
representative
classes
of
G4
fluorescent
turn-on
ligands
in
terms
of
their
interaction
mechanism
and
application
perspectives
.
Interestingly
,
G4
structures
are
commonly
identified
in
DNA
and
RNA
aptamers
against
targets
that
include
proteins
and
small
molecules
,
which
can
be
utilized
as
G4
tools
for
diverse
applications
.
We
therefore
also
summarize
the
recent
development
of
G4-containing
aptamers
and
highlight
their
applications
in
biosensing
,
bioimaging
,
and
therapy
.
Moreover
,
we
discuss
the
current
challenges
and
future
perspectives
of
G4
fluorescent
turn-on
ligands
and
G4-containing
aptamers
.
G4s
play
significant
roles
in
almost
every
cellular
event
,
including
but
not
limited
to
DNA
replication
,
transcription
,
translation
,
RNA
metabolism
,
and
epigenetic
remodeling
[
16
,
17
]
.
Recent
studies
have
also
suggested
that
G4
structures
can
serve
as
promising
cancer
and
anti-microbe
targets
[
18
,
19
]
.
To
identify
such
potential
G4
targets
,
various
computational
methods
such
as
QGRS
Mapper
[
20

,
quadparser
[
3
]
,
G4
Hunter
[
21
]
,
G4NN
[
22
]
,
and
Quadron
[
23
]
have
been
developed
to
predict
G4
formations
.
Spectroscopic
techniques
such
as
circular
dichroism
(
CD
)
[
24
]
,
UV
melting
[
25
]
,
mass
spectrometry
[

,
nuclear
magnetic
resonance
(
NMR
)
[
27
]
,
and
intrinsic
fluorescence
[
28
]
can
also
detect
G4
formation
based
on
its
physical
properties
in
a
label-free
manner
.
In
addition
to
these
biophysical
methods
,
biochemical
methods
such
as
polymerase
stop
assay
[
29
]
and
dimethyl
sulfate
(
DMS
)
footprinting
[
30
]
can
interrogate
DNA
G4
formation
by
template
extension
stalling
and
measuring
the
guanine
nucleotide
's
resistance
to
the
attachment
of
a
chemical
probe
,
respectively
.
More
recently
,
in
vitro
methods
that
utilize
rG4-mediated
reverse
transcriptase
stalling
have
been
developed
to
interrogate
rG4
in
low-abundance
transcripts
[
31
]
,
and
selective
2
-hydroxyl
acylation
analyzed
by
a
lithium
ion-mediated
primer
extension
(
SHALiPE
)
,
and
DMSLiPE
[
32
]
have
been
developed
to
map
distinctive
structural
patterns
of
rG4
.
Several
next-generation
sequencing-based
approaches
such
as
G4-seq
[
33

,
G4-Chip
[
34

rG4-seq
[
35
]
,
DMS-seq
[

,
and
G4RP
[
37
]
enable
the
genome-wide
and
transcriptome-wide
profiling
of
G4s
.
Another
key
category
for
G4
detection
is
to
use
fluorogenic
G4
ligands
whose
fluorescence
is
selectively
enhanced
when
interacting
with
G4s
.
These
fluorescent
turn-on
ligands
can
be
used
to
track
G4
formation
both
in
vitro
and
in
cells
,
and
they
are
discussed
in
detail
in
this
review
.
Besides
acting
as
potential
targets
,
G4s
can
be
used
as
molecular
tools
for
diverse
applications
.
It
is
worth
noting
that
the
structure
of
G4s
has
been
identified
in
studies
using
combinatorial
methods
and
the
systematic
evolution
of
ligands
by
exponential
enrichment
(

)
technique
with
the
aim
of
developing
aptamers
for
therapeutic
and
diagnostic
purposes
[
38
]
[
39
]
[
40
]
.
G4s
provide
extra
chemical
and
thermal
stability
for
aptamer-based
therapeutics
,
and
such
aptamers
have
been
successfully
designed
to
target
a
number
of
HIV
proteins
[
41
,

,
prion
proteins
[
43
]
,
and
anti-cancer
targets
[
44
,
45
]
.
In
diagnostics
,
G4-containing
aptamers
have
been
widely
applied
to
target
a
wide
range
of
pathogenic
proteins
and
small
molecules
to
emit
a
fluorescence-like
signal

In
this
review
,
we
summarize
the
recent
development
of
fluorogenic
G4
ligands
and
G4-containing
aptamers
,
and
highlight
their
latest
applications
in
vitro
and
in
cells
(

We
will
also
discuss
current
challenges
and
future
perspectives
for
better
detection
and
targeting
of
G4s
in
diverse
organisms
,
as
well
as
for
designing
and
developing
G4-related
tools
for
various
biological
applications
.
The
biological
significance
of
G4s
in
cells
has
led
to
a
quest
to
develop
diverse
ligands
that
could
help
researchers
understand
their
different
cellular
roles
.
On
the
one
hand
,
some
of
these
ligands
are
designed
as
fluorescent/imaging
probes
to
verify
G4
formation
.
On
the
other
hand
,
some
ligands
can
stabilize
G4s
and
serve
as
chemical
tools
to
challenge
and
alter
G4-dependent
processes
.
Also
,
it
is
possible
that
some
ligands
can
perform
both
functions
.
In
this
review
,
we
mainly
focus
on
the
organic
G4
probes
that
is
fluorogenic
for
in

and
in

detection
of

It

Background

Phylodynamics
,
the
study
of
the
interaction
between
epidemiological
and
pathogen
evolutionary
processes
within
and
among

,
was
originally
defined
in
the
context
of
rapidly
evolving
viruses
and
used
to
characterize
transmission
dynamics
.
The
concept
of
phylodynamics
has
evolved
since
the
early
21
st
century
,
extending
its
reach
to
slower-evolving
pathogens
,
including
bacteria
and
fungi
,
and
to
the
identification
of
influential
factors
in
disease
spread
and
pathogen
population
dynamics
.
Results
:
The
phylodynamic
approach
has
now
become
a
fundamental
building
block
for
the
development
of
comparative
phylogenetic
tools
capable
of
incorporating
epidemiological
surveillance
data
with
molecular
sequences
into
a
single
statistical

These
innovative
tools
have
greatly
enhanced
scientific
investigations
of
the
temporal

geographical
origins
,
evolutionary

one
of
the
main
features
of
cancer
cachexia
,
a
multifactorial
syndrome
frequently
occurring
in
oncologic
patients
.
The
onset
of
cachexia
is
associated
with
reduced
tolerance
and
response
to
antineoplastic
treatments
,
eventually
leading
to
clinical
conditions
that
are
not
compatible
with
survival
.
Among
the
mechanisms
underlying
cachexia
,
protein
and
energy
dysmetabolism
play
a
major
role
.
In
this
regard
,
several
potential
treatments
have
been
proposed
,
mainly
on
the
basis
of
promising
results
obtained
in
preclinical
models
.
However
,
at
present
,
no
treatment
yet
reached
validation
to
be
used
in
the
clinical
practice
,
although
several
drugs
are
currently
tested
in
clinical
trials
for
their
ability
to
improve
muscle
metabolism
in
cancer
patients
.
Along
this
line
,
the
results
obtained
in
both
experimental
and
clinical
studies
clearly
show
that
cachexia
can
be
effectively
approached
by
a
multidirectional
strategy
targeting
nutrition
,
inflammation
,
catabolism
,
and
inactivity
at
the
same
time
.
In
the
present
study
,
approaches
aimed
to
modulate
muscle
metabolism
in
cachexia
will
be
reviewed
.
Background
:
Persistent
infection
of
the
Japanese
Encephalitis
Virus
(
JEV
)
has
been
reported
in
clinical
cases
,
experimental
animals
,
and
various
cell
culture
systems
.
We
previously
reported
the
establishment
of
spontaneous
JEV
persistent
infection
,
assisted
by
defective
interfering
particle
accumulation
and/or
attenuated
helper
viruses
,
in
BHK-21
cells
devoid
of
virus-induced
apoptosis
,
cBS6-2
and
cBS6-3
.
However
,
cell-specific
factors
may
play
important
roles
in
controlling
JEV
replication
and
have
never
been
assessed
for
this
specific
phenomenon
.
Recent
evidence
suggests
that
viruses
have
evolved
various
mechanisms
to
cope
with
endoplasmic
reticulum
stress
signaling
pathways
for
their
efficient
amplification
and
transmission
,
including
the
unfolded
protein
response
(
UPR
)
.
Results
:
To
identify
the
host
cell
factors
that
affect
JEV
persistence
,
we
investigated
the
expression
of
essential
UPR
factors
in
cBS6-2
and
cBS6-3
cells
.
Of
the
selected
UPR
factors
tested
,
the
most
noticeable
deviations
from
those
of
the
normal
BHK-21
cells
with
JEV
acute
infection
were
as
follows
:
the
suppression
of
C/EBP
homologous
binding
protein
(
CHOP
)
and
the
constant
up-regulation
of
immunoglobulin
binding
protein
(
BiP
)
expression
in
cBS6-2
and
cBS6-3
cells
.
In
JEV
acute
infection
on
normal
BHK-21
cells
,
silencing
CHOP
expression
through
specific
siRNA
blocked
cell
death
almost
completely
.
Meanwhile
,
depletion
of
BiP
by
specific
siRNA
unlocked
CHOP
expression
in
cBS6-2
and
cBS6-3
cells
,
resulting
in
massive
cell
death
.
Fulminant
apoptotic
cell
death
for
both
cell
clones
on
tunicamycin
treatment
revealed
that
the
JEV
persistently
infected
cells
still
contained
functional
arms
for
cell
fate
decisions
.
Conclusions
:
BHK-21
cells
with
JEV
persistent
infection
strive
against
virus-induced
apoptosis
through
constant
up-regulation
of
BiP
expression
,
resulting
in
the
complete
depletion
of
CHOP
even
with
apparent
virus
amplification
in
the
cells
.
Accordingly
,
the
attenuation
of
virus
replication
as
well
as
the
modifications
to
cell
metabolism
could
be
additional
factors
contributing
to
the
development
of
JEV
persistent
infection
in
mammalian
cells
.
Influenza
A
virus
(
IAV
)
is
a
widespread
infectious
agent
commonly
found
in
mammalian
and
avian
species
.
In
humans
,
IAV
is
a
respiratory
pathogen
that
causes
seasonal
infections
associated
with
significant
morbidity
in
young
and
elderly
populations
,
and
has
a
large
economic
impact
.
Moreover
,
IAV
has
the
potential
to
cause
both
zoonotic
spillover
infection
and
global
pandemics
,
which
have
significantly
greater
morbidity
and
mortality
across
all
ages
.
The
pathology
associated
with
these
pandemic
and
spillover
infections
appear
to
be
the
result
of
an
excessive
inflammatory
response
leading
to
severe
lung
damage
,
which
likely
predisposes
the
lungs
for
secondary
bacterial
infections
.
The
lung
is
protected
from
pathogens
by
alveolar
epithelial
cells
,
endothelial
cells
,
tissue
resident
alveolar
macrophages
,
dendritic
cells
,
and
mast
cells
.
The
importance
of
mast
cells
during
bacterial
and
parasitic
infections
has
been
extensively
studied
;
yet
,
the
role
of
these
hematopoietic
cells
during
viral
infections
is
only
beginning
to
emerge
.
Recently
,
it
has
been
shown
that
mast
cells
can
be
directly
activated
in
response
to
IAV
,
releasing
mediators
such
histamine
,
proteases
,
leukotrienes
,
inflammatory
cytokines
,
and
antiviral
chemokines
,
which
participate
in
the
excessive
inflammatory
and
pathological
response
observed
during
IAV
infections
.
In
this
review
,
we
will
examine
the
relationship
between
mast
cells
and
IAV
,
and
discuss
the
role
of
mast
cells
as
a
potential
drug
target
during
highly
pathological
IAV
infections
.
Finally
,
we
proposed
an
emerging
role
for
mast
cells
in
other
viral
infections
associated
with
significant
host
pathology
.
Being
able
to
track
donor
reactive
T
cells
during
the
course
of
organ
transplantation
is
a
key
to
improve
the
graft
survival
,
to
prevent
graft
dysfunction
,
and
to
adapt
the
immunosuppressive
regimen
.
The
attempts
of
transplant
immunologists
have
been
for
long
hampered
by
the
large
size
of
the
alloreactive
T
cell
repertoire
.
Understanding
how
self-TCR
can
interact
with
allogeneic
MHC
is
a
key
to
critically
appraise
the
different
assays
available
to
analyze
the
TCR
Vβ
repertoire
usage
.
In
this
report
,
we
will
review
conceptually
and
experimentally
the
process
of
cross-reactivity
.
We
will
then
highlight
what
can
be
learned
from
allotransplantation
,
a
situation
of
artificial
cross-reactivity
.
Finally
,
the
low-and
high-resolution
techniques
to
characterize
the
TCR
Vβ
repertoire
usage
in
transplantation
will
be
critically
discussed
.
Background
:
Porcine
epidemic
diarrhea
(
PED
)
is
a
syndrome
that
is
characterized
by
rapidly
spreading
watery
diarrhea
affecting
pigs
of
all
ages
,
but
with
major
effects
on
suckling
piglets
.
The
disease
,
as
well
as
the
causative
Alphacoronavirus
,
the
Porcine
epidemic
diarrhea
virus
(
PEDV
)
,
was
first
described
in
Europe
in
the
1970s
and
since
then
has
spread
over
many
Asian
and
American
countries
,
where
it
recently
led
to
devastating
effects
on
swine
health
and
pork
industry
.
While
the
disease
was
seldom
reported
in
Europe
within
the
last
few
decades
,
a
few
recent
reports
re-emergence
of
PED
in
German
pig
farms
.
The
hitherto
isolated
German
strain
seems
to
be
closely
related
to
a
low
pathogenic
PEDV
variant
from
the
USA
.
This
case
report
describes
the
first
detection
of
PEDV
in
Austria
.
Case
presentation
:
Reduced
feed
uptake
and
occasional
diarrhea
were
observed
in
December
2014
in
a
group
of
fattening
pigs
,
kept
on
an
Austrian
swine
farm
.
The
concerned
pigs
had
been
recently
purchased
from
Germany
.
Within
a
few
weeks
,
diarrhea
became
apparent
also
in
pigs
of
Austrian
origin
,
which
were
kept
in
a
different
stable
on
the
same
farm
.
Gastrointestinal
symptoms
among
fattening
pigs
were
generally
mild
,
quickly
resolving
and
did
not
lead
to
death
.
PEDV
RNA
was
identified
by
RT-qPCR
in
pooled
feces
and
serum
and
PEDV
antibodies
were
detectable
in
serum
in
both
groups
of
pigs
.
Phylogenetic
analysis
of
the
nearly
complete
PEDV
spike
gene
shows
that
the
Austrian
PEDV
strain
is
highly
similar
to
other
strains
involved
in
recent
outbreaks
in
Western
and
Central
Europe
.
Conclusion
:
This
is
the
first
report
demonstrating
the
presence
of
PEDV
in
Austria
.
The
virus
was
probably
introduced
by
purchasing
piglets
from
a
German
source
,
which
underlines
the
significance
of
trans-boundary
animal
trade
for
the
distribution
of
highly
contagious
diseases
,
such
as
PED
.
Background
:
The
aim
of
this
study
was
to
assess
the
burden
of
respiratory

,
considering
the

.
Methods
:
A
multicenter
cross-sectional
study
,
involving
27
referral
maternity
hospitals
in
five
Brazilian
regions
.
Cases
were
identified
in
a
prospective
surveillance
by
using
the
WHO
standardized
criteria
for
potentially
life-threatening
conditions

were
compared
to
those
with
other
causes
of
severe

.
A

cases
classified
women
as
non-tested
,
tested

.
Factors
associated
with
severe

Results
:
Among
9555
cases
of
severe
maternal
morbidity
,
485
(
5
%
)
had
respiratory

.
Respiratory
disease
occurred
in
one-quarter
of

of
these
women
were
tested
,

,
with
a
two-fold

with
increased
prematurity
,

.
Conclusions
:
Respiratory
disease
,
especially
considering
the
influenza
season
,
is
a
very
severe
cause
of
maternal

.
Increased
awareness
about
this
condition
,
preventive

treatment
are
required
to
improve
maternal

This
review
describes
the
mechanisms
of

its
associations
with
other
cell
death
mechanisms
,
including
apoptosis
,

Genetic
defects
in
autophagy
can
have
pathological
consequences

.
Further
studies
on
the
process
of
autophagy
in
different
microbial
infections
could
help
to
design

Microautophagy
refers
to
the
process
by
which
lysosomes
directly
engulf
and
digest
small
volumes
of
cytosolic
substrate
[

,
whilst
CMA
is
induced
by
physiological
stresses
such
as
prolonged
starvation
[

]
and
involves
the
heat
shock
cognate
protein
(
HSC70
;
71-kDa
,
also
known
as
HSPA8
)
which
contains
a
KFERQ-like
pentapeptide
sequence
[

]
.
The
CMA
pathway
delivers
target
proteins
across
lysosomal
membranes
into
the
lysosomal
lumen
by
interacting
with
lysosome-associated
membrane
protein
type
2A
(
LAMP-2A
)

Hence
,
CMA
differs
from
microautophagy
and
macroautophagy
,
as
it
does
not
require
vesicular
trafficking
[

.
Regardless
of
the
type
,
autophagy
acts
as
a
cleaning
mechanism
by
removing
or
degrading
unnecessary
materials
from
the
body
(
e.g.
,
proteins

The
physiological
processes
of
autophagy
are
governed
by
numerous
cellular
regulators

Hence
,
autophagy

can
affect
the
pathogenesis

The
roles

Currently
,
the
roles
of
autophagy
are
being
explored
in
diverse
fields
of
study
.
Autophagy
plays
important
roles
in
cancer

has
been
shown
to
modulate
autophagy
and
prevent
the
growth
of
ovarian
cancer
cells
[

Clinical
studies
have
revealed
higher
levels
of
autophagic
flux
in
distant
metastases
than
in
primary
tumors
[
26

;
therefore
,
autophagy
has
stage-dependent
dual
roles
in
cancer
which
may
facilitate
the
growth
and
spread
of
tumors
and
affect
treatment
resistance
[

Conversely
,
autophagy
has
been
shown
to
act
as
a
tumor
suppressor
during
the
early
and
late
phases
of
cancer
development
[
28
,

]
by
mediating
the
destruction
and
removal
of
carcinogens
and
cancerous
cells
,
thus
enabling
the
growth
and
development
of
healthy
cells
;
however
,
under
disturbed
or
uncontrolled
conditions
autophagy
can
promote
cancer
growth
and
dissemination
.
Autophagy
is
also
important
in
neuronal
homeostasis
,
with
its
dysfunction
associated
with
numerous
neurodegenerative
disorders
[

Pathogenic
protein
aggregates
are
a
common
feature

and
dysfunctional
autophagy
is
involved
in
this
disease

Furthermore
,
mutations
in

These

stages
of
autophagy
and
thus
have
different
implications
for

the
spread

In
recent
years
,
it
has
been
shown
that
autophagy
has
a
role
in
many
emerging
and
re-emerging
infectious
viral
and
bacterial
diseases
that
pose
significant
threats

Autophagy
initially
encounters
these
infectious
pathogens
to
neutralize
them

however
,
may
infections
can
propagate
themselves
as
persistent
intracellular
infections

are
generally
associated
with
wide
outbreaks

Many
viral
life

are
linked
with
autophagic

The

the
later

Classical

whilst
Dengue/Zika

triggers
the
lysosomal

therefore
transcription

enhanced
,
whilst

Numerous
physiobiological
roles

as
the
disposal
of
endogenous

disturbing
the
natural
balance

pathological
consequences
[

.
Since
it
is
the
primary
system
for
cleaning
the
body
,
autophagy
can
prevent
or
treat
cancer

killing
cancerous
cells
and
degrading
endogenous
or
exogenous
carcinogens

thus
,
favoring
the
development
of
healthy
cells
.
However
,
autophagy
may
have
dual
roles
in
cancer
as
it
is
involved
in
stem
cell-related
resistance

As
obligate
intracellular
pathogens

viruses
interact
with
multiple

including
metabolism
,
cellular
trafficking
,
and
immunity-related
responses

Furthermore
,
autophagy

Thus
,
it
can
affect
the
activation
of
neuronal
cells

suppress
neurotoxicity

Moreover
,
it
can
downregulate

In
selective
autophagy

Autophagy

process
of
delivering
cytoplasmic

extracellular
components

the
lysosomes

Furthermore

it

macroautophagy

on
the

Background
:
WNV-associated
encephalitis
(
WNVE
)
is
characterized
by
increased
production
of
pro-inflammatory
mediators
,
glial
cells
activation
and
eventual
loss
of
neurons
.
WNV
infection
of
neurons
is
rapidly
progressive
and
destructive
whereas
infection
of
non-neuronal
brain
cells
is
limited
.
However
,
the
role
of
neurons
and
pathological
consequences
of
pro-inflammatory
cytokines
released
as
a
result
of
WNV
infection
is
unclear
.
Therefore
,
the
objective
of
this
study
was
to
examine
the
role
of
key
cytokines
secreted
by
WNV-infected
neurons
in
mediating
neuroinflammatory
markers
and
neuronal
death
.
Methods
:
A
transformed
human
neuroblastoma
cell
line
,
SK-N-SH
,
was
infected
with
WNV
at
multiplicity
of
infection
(
MOI
)
-1
and
-5
,
and
WNV
replication
kinetics
and
expression
profile
of
key
pro-inflammatory
cytokines
were
analyzed
by
plaque
assay
,
qRT-PCR
,
and
ELISA
.
Cell
death
was
measured
in
SK-N-SH
cell
line
in
the
presence
and
absence
of
neutralizing
antibodies
against
key
pro-inflammatory
cytokines
using
cell
viability
assay
,
TUNEL
and
flow
cytometry
.
Further
,
naïve
primary
astrocytes
were
treated
with
UV-inactivated
supernatant
from
mock-and
WNV-infected
SK-N-SH
cell
line
and
the
activation
of
astrocytes
was
measured
using
flow
cytometry
and
ELISA
.
Results
:
WNV-infected
SK-N-SH
cells
induced
the
expression
of
IL-1β
,
-6
,
-8
,
and
TNF-α
in
a
dose-and
timedependent
manner
,
which
coincided
with
increase
in
virus-induced
cell
death
.
Treatment
of
cells
with
anti-IL-1β
or
-TNF-α
resulted
in
significant
reduction
of
the
neurotoxic
effects
of
WNV
.
Furthermore
treatment
of
naïve
astrocytes
with
UV-inactivated
supernatant
from
WNV-infected
SK-N-SH
cell
line
increased
expression
of
glial
fibrillary
acidic
protein
and
key
inflammatory
cytokines
.
Conclusion
:
Our
results
for
the
first
time
suggest
that
neurons
are
one
of
the
potential
sources
of
proinflammatory
cytokines
in
WNV-infected
brain
and
these
neuron-derived
cytokines
contribute
to
WNV-induced
neurotoxicity
.
Moreover
,
cytokines
released
from
neurons
also
mediate
the
activation
of
astrocytes
.
Our
data
define
specific
role
(
s
)
of
WNV-induced
pro-inflammatory
cytokines
and
provide
a
framework
for
the
development
of
antiinflammatory
drugs
as
much-needed
therapeutic
interventions
to
limit
symptoms
associated
with
WNVE
.
In
the
case
of
outbreaks

it
is
imperative
to
find
sources

through
timely
epidemiological
investigations
and
to
establish
an
appropriate
prevention
method
based
on
the
results
of
the
investigations
.
However
,
inadequate
initial
epidemiological
investigations
sometimes
lead
to
an
inability
to
elucidate
the
causes
of
the
spreading

to
establish
clear
disease
prevention
strategies

timely
prevention

criticism
on
the
lack
of
field
epidemiologists
available
to
conduct
epidemiological
investigations
in
emergency
situations
and
the
lack
of
con-OBJECTIVES
:
The
field
epidemiologist
system
of
South
Korea
,
which
employs
public
health
doctors
who
are
relatively
more
readily
available
,
was
created
in
1999
to
ensure
a
ready
supply
of
experts
for
epidemiological
investigations
and
enable
an
effective
response
for
new
and
reemerging
infectious
diseases
.
However
,
the
2015
outbreak
of
Middle
East
Respiratory
Syndrome
revealed
limitations
in
the
existing
systems
of
management
of
field
epidemiologists
and
communicable
diseases
.
The
present
study
aims
to
evaluate
data
on
current
states
,
administrative
reports
,
and
other
literature
on
the
field
epidemiologist
system
that
has
been
in
place
in
South
Korea
for
16
years
since
1999
and
to
suggest
appropriate
future
improvements
in
this
system
.
By
suggesting
methods
to
evaluate
the
field
epidemiologist
system
and
training
programs
and
by
suggesting
ways
for
the
Korea
Centers
for
Disease
Control
and
Prevention
to
conduct
evaluations
on
its
own
,
the
present
study
provides
supporting
evidence
for
improvement
of
systems
for
training
of
experts
in
epidemiological
investigations
.
Moreover
,
based
on
the
findings
,
this
study
also
suggests
methods
to
systematically
train
experts
in
communicable
diseases
management
and
a
sustainable
system
to
establish
the
basis
of
and
develop
strategies
for
a
systematic
and
phased
management
of
field
epidemiologist
training
programs
.
The
present
study
suggests
the
possibility
of
establishing
dedicated
training
facilities
,
revising
the
guidelines
on
training
and
improvement
of
the
competency
of
public
health
experts
,
while
not
limiting
the
scope
of
application
to
communicable
diseases
.
The
ongoing
Middle
East
respiratory
syndrome
coronavirus
(
MERS-CoV
)
outbreaks
pose
a
worldwide
public
health
threat
.
Blocking
MERS-CoV
zoonotic
transmission
from
dromedary
camels
,
the
animal
reservoir
,
could
potentially
reduce
the
number
of
primary
human
cases
.
Here
we
report
MERS-CoV
transmission
from
experimentally
infected
llamas
to
naïve
animals
.
Directly
inoculated
llamas
shed
virus
for
at
least
6
days
and
could
infect
all
in-contact
naïve
animals
4-5
days
after
exposure
.
With
the
aim
to
block
virus
transmission
,
we
examined
the
efficacy
of
a
recombinant
spike
S1-protein
vaccine
.
In
contrast
to
naïve
animals
,
in-contact
vaccinated
llamas
did
not
shed
infectious
virus
upon
exposure
to
directly
inoculated
llamas
,
consistent
with
the
induction
of
strong
virus
neutralizing
antibody
responses
.
Our
data
provide
further
evidence
that
vaccination
of
the
reservoir
host
may
impede
MERS-CoV
zoonotic
transmission
to
humans
.
Rolling
circle
amplification
(
RCA
)
generates
single-stranded
DNAs
or
RNA
,
and
the
diverse
applications
of
this
isothermal
technique
range
from
the
sensitive
detection
of
nucleic
acids
to
analysis
of
single
nucleotide
polymorphisms
.
Microwave
chemistry
is
widely
applied
to
increase
reaction
rate
as
well
as
product
yield
and
purity
.
The
objectives
of
the
present
research
were
to
apply
microwave
heating
to
RCA
and
indicate
factors
that
contribute
to
the
microwave
selective
heating
effect
.
The
microwave
reaction
temperature
was
strictly
controlled
using
a
microwave
applicator
optimized
for
enzymatic-scale
reactions
.
Here
,
we
showed
that
microwave-assisted
RCA
reactions
catalyzed
by
either
of
the
four
thermostable
DNA
polymerases
were
accelerated
over
4-folds
compared
with
conventional
RCA
.
Furthermore
,
the
temperatures
of
the
individual
buffer
components
were
specifically
influenced
by
microwave
heating
.
We
concluded
that
microwave
heating
accelerated
isothermal
RCA
of
DNA
because
of
the
differential
heating
mechanisms
of
microwaves
on
the
temperatures
of
reaction
components
,
although
the
overall
reaction
temperatures
were
the
same
.
We
have
previously
described
the
use
of
a
double
coated
agarose-agarose
porcine
islet
macrobead
for
the
treatment
of
type
I
diabetes
mellitus
.
In
the
current
study
,
the
long-term
viral
safety
of
macrobead
implantation
into
pancreatectomized
diabetic
dogs
treated
with
pravastatin
(
=
3
)
was
assessed
while
2
dogs
served
as
nonimplanted
controls
.
A
more
gradual
return
to
preimplant
insulin
requirements
occurred
after
a
2nd
implant
procedure
(
days
148
,
189
,
and
>
652
)
when
compared
to
a
first
macrobead
implantation
(
days
9
,
21
,
and
21
)
in
all
macrobead
implanted
animals
.
In
all
three
implanted
dogs
,
porcine
C-peptide
was
detected
in
the
blood
for
at
least
10
days
following
the
first
implant
and
for
at
least
26
days
following
the
second
implant
.
C-peptide
was
also
present
in
the
peritoneal
fluid
of
all
three
implanted
dogs
at
6
months
after
2nd
implant
and
in
2
of
3
dogs
at
necropsy
.
Prescreening
results
of
islet
macrobeads
and
culture
media
prior
to
transplantation
were
negative
for
13
viruses
.
No
evidence
of
PERV
or
other
viral
transmission
was
found
throughout
the
study
.
This
study
demonstrates
that
the
long-term
(
2.4
years
)
implantation
of
agaroseagarose
encapsulated
porcine
islets
is
a
safe
procedure
in
a
large
animal
model
of
type
I
diabetes
mellitus
.
for
those
patients
already
receiving
immunosuppressive
therapy
for
a
kidney
allograft
[
1
]
.
Alternatively
,
the
insulinproducing
islets
can
be
isolated
from
the
majority
of
the
pancreas
and
transplanted
alone
as
free
islets
[
2
]
.
As
noted
above
,
a
necessary
component
of
the
transplantation
of
an
allogeneic
pancreas
or
the
islets
alone
is
the
need
for
lifelong
immunosuppressive
therapy
.
Because
complications
from
such
immunosuppressive
therapy
can
include
increased
susceptibility
to
infections
,
malignancy
,
neurotoxicity
,
and
nephrotoxicity
,
allotransplantation
must
be
carefully
considered
and
is
often
not
suitable
for
young
patients
[

]
.
Further
,
the
availability
of
human
donor
pancreas
is
extremely
limited
with
only
about
2,000
pancreas
donors
per
year
[

.
Worse
,
Here
we
describe
an
algorithm
for
simulating
epidemics
from
our
proposed
individual
model
.
Consider
the
situation
where
there
is
one
infectious
individual
at
current
time
t
(
i.e
.
the
time
of
this
individual
transits
from
class
E
to
class
I
)
among
an
entirely
susceptible
population
.
The
simulation
proceeds
as
follows
:
Natural
HIV-1
protease
(
PR
)
is
homodimeric
.
Some
researchers
believe
that
interactions
between
HIV-1
Gag-Pol
molecules
trigger
the
activation
of
embedded
PR
(
which
mediates
Gag
and
Gag-Pol
cleavage
)
,
and
that
Gag-Pol
assembly
domains
outside
of
PR
may
contribute
to
PR
activation
by
influencing
PR
dimer
interaction
in
a
Gag-Pol
context
.
To
determine
if
the
enhancement
of
PR
dimer
interaction
facilitates
PR
activation
,
we
placed
single
or
tandem
repeat
leucine
zippers
(
LZ
)
at
the
PR
C-terminus
,
and
looked
for
a
correlation
between
enhanced
Gag
processing
efficiency
and
increased
Gag-PR-LZ
multimerization
capacity
.
We
found
significant
reductions
in
virus-like
particles
(
VLPs
)
produced
by
HIV-1
mutants
,
with
LZ
fused
to
the
end
of
PR
as
a
result
of
enhanced
Gag
cleavage
efficiency
.
Since
VLP
production
can
be
restored
to
wt
levels
following
PR
activity
inhibition
,
this
assembly
defect
is
considered
PR
activity-dependent
.
We
also
found
a
correlation
between
the
LZ
enhancement
effect
on
Gag
cleavage
and
enhanced
Gag-PR
multimerization
.
The
results
suggest
that
PR
dimer
interactions
facilitated
by
forced
Gag-PR
multimerization
lead
to
premature
Gag
cleavage
,
likely
a
result
of
premature
PR
activation
.
Our
conclusion
is
that
placement
of
a
heterologous
dimerization
domain
downstream
of
PR
enhances
PRmediated
Gag
cleavage
efficiency
,
implying
that
structural
conformation
,
rather
than
the
primary
sequence
outside
of
PR
,
is
a
major
determinant
of
HIV-1
PR
activation
.
Extracts
of
Echinacea
species
have
been
used
traditionally
in
North
America
for
the
control
of
symptoms
of
colds
,
influenza
,
and
other
diseases
,
and
some
of
them
have
become
very
popular
as
``
herbal
medicines
''
.
Recent
studies
have
revealed
that
preparations
derived
from
certain
species
and
plant
parts
,
but
not
all
of
them
,
possess
potent
antiviral
activities
,
at
non-cytotoxic
concentrations
,
particularly
against
membrane-containing
viruses
.
Thus
all
strains
of
human
and
avian
influenza
viruses
tested
(
including
a
Tamiflu-resistant
strain
)
,
as
well
as
herpes
simplex
virus
,
respiratory
syncytial
virus
,
and
rhinoviruses
,
were
very
sensitive
to
a
standardized
Echinacea
purpurea
preparation
.
In
mechanistic
studies
the
influenza
virus-specific
hemagglutinin
and
neuraminidase
were
inhibited
.
In
addition
some
extracts
displayed
anti-inflammatory
activity
in
virus-infected
cells
,
and
numerous
other
effects
on
the
expression
of
cellular
genes
.
Multiple
components
,
either
discrete
compounds
or
mixtures
,
appeared
to
be
responsible
for
the
various
antiviral
activities
.
The
importance
of
spatial
clusters
,
or
``
hotspots
,
''
in
infectious
disease
epidemiology
has
been
increasingly
recognized
,
and
targeting
hotspots
is
often
seen
as
an
important
component
of
disease-control
strategies
.
However
,
the
precise
meaning
of
``
hotspot
''
varies
widely
in
current
research
and
policy
documents
.
Hotspots
have
been
variously
described
as
areas
of
elevated
incidence
or
prevalence
,
higher
transmission
efficiency
or
risk
,
or
higher
probability
of
disease
emergence
.
This
ambiguity
has
led
to
confusion
and
may
result
in
mistaken
inferences
regarding
the
best
way
to
target
interventions
.
We
surveyed
the
literature
on
epidemiologic
hotspots
,
examining
the
multitude
of
ways
in
which
the
term
is
used
;
and
highlight
the
difference
in
the
geographic
scale
of
hotspots
and
the
properties
they
are
supposed
to
have
.
In
response
to
the
diversity
in
the
term
's
usage
,
we
advocate
the
use
of
more
precise
terms
,
such
as
``
burden
hotspot
,
''
``
transmission
hotspot
,
''
and
``
emergence
hotspot
,
''
as
well
as
explicit
specification
of
the
spatiotemporal
scale
of
interest
.
Increased
precision
in
terminology
is
needed
to
ensure
clear
and
effective
policies
for
disease
control
.
Porcine
epidemic
diarrhea
virus
(
PEDV
)
,
a
predominant
cause
of
acute
enteric
infection
,
leads
to
severe
dehydrating
diarrhea
and
mortality
in
piglets
all
over
the
world
.
A
virulent
PEDV
YN13
strain
,
isolated
in
our
laboratory
,
was
attenuated
to
yield
an
attenuated
PEDV
strain
YN144
.
To
better
understand
the
pathogenesis
mechanism
and
the
virus-host
interaction
during
infection
with
both
PEDV
YN13
and
YN144
strains
,
a
comparative
proteomic
analysis
was
carried
out
to
investigate
the
proteomic
changes
produced
in
the
primary
target
organ
,
using
isobaric
tags
for
relative
and
absolute
quantitation
(
iTRAQ
)
labeling
,
followed
by
liquid
chromatography
tandem-mass
spectrometry
(
LC-MS/MS
)
.
A
total
of
269
and
301
differently
expressed
proteins
(
DEPs
)
were
identified
in
the
jejunum
tissues
of
the
piglets
inoculated
with
YN13
and
YN144
,
respectively
.
Bioinformatics
analysis
revealed
that
these
proteins
were
involved
in
stress
responses
,
signal
transduction
,
and
the
immune
system
.
All
of
these
involved
interferon-stimulated
genes
(
ISGs
)
which
were
up-regulated
in
jejunums
by
both
of
the
PEDV-infected
groups
.
Based
on
the
comparative
analysis
,
we
proposed
that
different
changes
induced
by
YN13
and
YN144
in
heterogeneous
nuclear
ribonucleoprotein
A1
(
hnRNPA1
)
,
eukaryotic
initiation
factor
4G1
(
eIF4G1
)
,
and
some
members
in
the
heat
shock
protein
(
HSP
)
family
,
may
be
responsible
for
differences
in
their
pathogenicity
.
Species
identification
through
genetic
barcoding
can
augment
traditional
taxonomic
methods
,
which
rely
on
morphological
features
of
the
specimen
.
Such
approaches
are
especially
valuable
when
specimens
are
in
poor
condition
or
comprise
very
limited
material
,
a
situation
that
often
applies
to
chiropteran
(
bat
)
specimens
submitted
to
the
Canadian
Food
Inspection
Agency
for
rabies
diagnosis
.
Coupled
with
phenotypic
plasticity
of
many
species
and
inconclusive
taxonomic
keys
,
species
identification
using
only
morphological
traits
can
be
challenging
.
In
this
study
,
a
microarray
assay
with
associated
PCR
of
the
mitochondrial
cytochrome
c
oxidase
subunit
I
(
COI
)

was
developed
for
differentiation
of

bat
species
submitted
to
the
Canadian
Food
Inspection
Agency
from
1985-2012
for
rabies
diagnosis
.
The
assay
was
validated
with
a
reference
collection
of
DNA
from
153
field

Our
ability
to
respond
appropriately
to
infectious
diseases
is
enhanced
by
identifying
differences
in
the
potential
for
transmitting
infection
between
individuals
.
Here
,
we
identify
epidemiological
traits
of
self-limited
infections
(
i.e
.
infections
with
an
effective
reproduction
number
satisfying
0vR
eff
v1
)
that
correlate
with
transmissibility
.
Our
analysis
is
based
on
a
branching
process
model
that
permits
statistical
comparison
of
both
the
strength
and
heterogeneity
of
transmission
for
two
distinct
types
of
cases
.
Our
approach
provides
insight
into
a
variety
of
scenarios
,
including
the
transmission
of
Middle
East
Respiratory
Syndrome
Coronavirus
(
MERS-CoV
)
in
the
Arabian
peninsula
,
measles
in
North
America
,
pre-eradication
smallpox
in
Europe
,
and
human
monkeypox
in
the
Democratic
Republic
of
the
Congo
.
When
applied
to
chain
size
data
for
MERS-CoV
transmission
before
2014
,
our
method
indicates
that
despite
an
apparent
trend
towards
improved
control
,
there
is
not
enough
statistical
evidence
to
indicate
that
R
eff
has
declined
with
time
.
Meanwhile
,
chain
size
data
for
measles
in
the
United
States
and
Canada
reveal
statistically
significant
geographic
variation
in
R
eff
,
suggesting
that
the
timing
and
coverage
of
national
vaccination
programs
,
as
well
as
contact
tracing
procedures
,
may
shape
the
size
distribution
of
observed
infection
clusters
.
Infection
source
data
for
smallpox
suggests
that
primary
cases
transmitted
more
than
secondary
cases
,
and
provides
a
quantitative
assessment
of
the
effectiveness
of
control
interventions
.
Human
monkeypox
,
on
the
other
hand
,
does
not
show
evidence
of
differential
transmission
between
animals
in
contact
with
humans
,
primary
cases
,
or
secondary
cases
,
which
assuages
the
concern
that
social
mixing
can
amplify
transmission
by
secondary
cases
.
Lastly
,
we
evaluate
surveillance
requirements
for
detecting
a
change
in
the
human-to-human
transmission
of
monkeypox
since
the
cessation
of
cross-protective
smallpox
vaccination
.
Our
studies
lay
the
foundation
for
future
investigations
regarding
how
infection
source
,
vaccination
status
or
other
putative
transmissibility
traits
may
affect
self-limited
transmission
.
Middle
East
respiratory
syndrome
coronavirus
(
MERS-CoV
)
was
first
identified
in
2012
as
a
novel
etiological
agent
of
severe
respiratory
disease
in
humans
.
As
during
infection
by
other
viruses
,
host
sensing
of
viral
double-stranded
RNA
(
dsRNA
)
induces
several
antiviral
pathways
.
These
include
interferon
(
IFN
)
,
oligoadenylate
synthetase
(
OAS
)
-RNase
L
,
and
protein
kinase
R
(
PKR
)
.
Coronaviruses
,
including
MERS-CoV
,
potently
suppress
the
activation
of
these
pathways
,
inducing
only
modest
host
responses
.
Our
study
describes
the
functions
of
two
accessory
proteins
unique
to
MERS-CoV
and
related
viruses
,
NS4a
and
NS4b
,
during
infection
in
human
airway
epithelium-derived
A549
cells
.
NS4a
has
been
previously
characterized
as
a
dsRNA
binding
protein
,
while
NS4b
is
a
2=,5=-phosphodiesterase
with
structural
and
enzymatic
similarity
to
NS2
encoded
by
mouse
hepatitis
virus
(
MHV
)
.
We
found
that
deletion
of
NS4a
results
in
increased
interferon
lambda
(
IFNL1
)
expression
,
as
does
mutation
of
either
the
catalytic
site
or
nuclear
localization
sequence
of
NS4b
.
All
of
the
mutant
viruses
we
tested
exhibited
slight
decreases
in
replication
.
We
previously
reported
that
,
like
MHV
NS2
,
NS4b
antagonizes
OAS-RNase
L
,
but
suppression
of
IFN
is
a
previously
unidentified
function
for
viral
phosphodiesterases
.
Unexpectedly
,
deletion
of
NS4a
does
not
result
in
robust
activation
of
the
PKR
or
OAS-RNase
L
pathways
.
Therefore
,
MERS-CoV
likely
encodes
other
proteins
that
contribute
to
suppression
or
evasion
of
these
antiviral
innate
immune
pathways
that
should
be
an
important
focus
of
future
work
.
This
study
provides
additional
insight
into
the
complex
interactions
between
MERS-CoV
and
the
host
immune
response
.
IMPORTANCE
Middle
East
respiratory
syndrome
coronavirus
(
MERS-CoV
)
is
the
second
novel
zoonotic
coronavirus
to
emerge
in
the
21st
century
and
cause
outbreaks
of
severe
respiratory
disease
.
More
than
2,200
cases
and
800
deaths
have
been
reported
to
date
,
yet
there
are
no
licensed
vaccines
or
treatments
.
Coronaviruses
encode
unique
accessory
proteins
that
are
not
required
for
replication
but
most
likely
play
roles
in
immune
antagonism
and/or
pathogenesis
.
Our
study
describes
the
functions
of
MERS-CoV
accessory
proteins
NS4a
and
NS4b
during
infection
of
a
human
airway-derived
cell
line
.
Loss
of
these
accessory
proteins
during
MERS-CoV
infection
leads
to
host
antiviral
activation
and
modestly
attenuates
replication
.
In
the
case
of
both
NS4a
and
NS4b
,
we
have
identified
roles
during
infection
not
previously
described
,
yet
the
lack
of
robust
activation
suggests
much
remains
to
be
learned
about
the
interactions
between
MERS-CoV
and
the
infected
host
.
of
infection
to
uncover
the
full
range
of
their
interactions
with
the
innate
immune
response
.
RESULTS

Conclusions
:
PEDV
PC22A
P100C4
and
P120
were
fully
attenuated
in
weaned
pigs
but
failed
to
elicit
protection
against
virulent
P3
challenge
.
P100C4
induced
higher
PEDV-specific
antibody
responses
than
P120
post
inoculation
resulting
in
a
greater
anamnestic
response
post
challenge
.
Therefore
,
P100C4
potentially
could
be
tested
as
a
priming
vaccine
or
be
further
modified
using
reverse
genetics
.
It
also
can
be
administered
in
multiple
doses
or
be
combined
with
inactivated
or
subunit
vaccines
and
adjuvants
as
a
PEDV
vaccination
regimen
,
whose
efficacy
can
be
tested
in

Background
:
Human
rotavirus
(
HRV
)
is
the
most
important
cause
of
severe
diarrhea
in
infants
and
young
children
.
Probiotic
Lactobacillus
rhamnosus
GG
(
LGG
)
reduces
rotavirus
infection
and
diarrhea
.
However
,
the
molecular
mechanisms
of
LGG-mediated
protection
from
rotavirus
infection
are
poorly
understood
.
Autophagy
plays
an
essential
role
in
responses
to
microbial
pathogens
.
However
,
the
role
of
autophagy
in
HRV
infection
and
LGG
treatment
is
unknown
.
We
hypothesize
that
rotavirus
gastroenteritis
activates
autophagy
and
that
LGG
suppresses
virus-induced
autophagy
and
prevents
intestinal
damage
in
infected
piglets
.
We
used
LGG
feeding
to
combat
viral
gastroenteritis
in
the
gnotobiotic
pig
model
of
virulent
HRV
infection
.
Results
:
We
found
that
LGG
feeding
did
not
increase
autophagy
,
whereas
virus
infection
induced
autophagy
in
the
piglet
intestine
.
Virus
infection
increased
the
protein
levels
of
the
autophagy
markers
ATG16L1
and
Beclin-1
and
the
autophagy
regulator
mTOR
.
LGG
treatment
during
viral
gastroenteritis
reduced
autophagy
marker
expression
to
normal
levels
,
induced
apoptosis
and
partially
prevented
virus-induced
tissue
damage
.
Our
study
provides
new
insights
into
virus-induced
autophagy
and
LGG
suppression
of
uncontrolled
autophagy
and
intestinal
injury
.
A
better
understanding
of
the
antiviral
activity
of
LGG
will
lead
to
novel
therapeutic
strategies
for
infant
infectious
diseases
.
The
objective
of
this
study
was
to
screen
for
antigens
of
the
hepatitis
C
virus
(
HCV
)
to
establish
a
new
double
antibody
sandwich-lateral
flow
immunoassay
(
DAS-LFIA
)
method
for
testing
the
presence
of
anti-HCV
antibodies
in
human
serum
or
plasma
.
A
series
of
different
recombinant
HCV
proteins
in
Escherichia
coli
cells
were
constructed
,
expressed
,
purified
and
the
new
DAS-LFIA
strip
was
developed
.
The
sensitivity
and
specificity
of
new
the
DAS-LFIA
strip
were
evaluated
by
detecting
23
HCV-positive
sera
,
a
set
of
quality
control
references
for
anti-HCV
detection
that
contain
known
amounts
of
anti-HCV
antibodies
,
and
8
HCV-negative
sera
.
A
total
of
300
clinical
serum
samples
was
examined
by
both
the
new
DAS-LFIA
strip
and
enzyme-linked
immunosorbent
assay
(
ELISA
)
.
Data
were
analyzed
using
SPSS
11.5
software
.
The
sensitivity
and
specificity
of
the
new
DAS-LFIA
strip
were
100
%
.
The
lowest
test
line
of
the
HCV
DAS-LFIA
strips
was
2
NCU/ml
.
Additionally
,
the
concordance
between
the
new
DAS-LFIA
strip
and
ELISA
methods
was
94.33
%
.
In
conclusion
,
our
new
testing
method
is
rapid
,
simple
,
sensitive
and
specifically
detects
the
presence
of
anti-HCV
antibodies
in
human
serum
or
plasma
.
Therefore
,
it
may
be
used
for
monitoring
HCV
.

Emerging
diseases
must
make
a
transition
from
stuttering
chains
of
transmission
to
sustained
chains
of
transmission
,
but
this
critical
transition
need
not
coincide
with
the
system
becoming
supercritical
.
That
is
,
the
introduction
of
infection
to
a
supercritical
system
results
in
a
significant
fraction
of
the
population
becoming
infected
only
with
a
certain
probability
.
Understanding
the
waiting
time
to
the
first
major
outbreak
of
an
emerging
disease
is
then
more
complicated
than
determining
when
the
system
becomes
supercritical
.
We
treat
emergence
as
a
dynamic
bifurcation
,
and
use
the
concept
of
bifurcation
delay
to
understand
the
time
to
emergence
after
a
system
becomes
supercritical
.
Specifically
,
we
consider
an
SIR
model
with
a
time-varying
transmission
term
and
random
infections
originating
from
outside
the
population
.
We
derive
an
analytic
density
function
for
the
delay
times
and
find
it
to
be
,
in
general
,
in
agreement
with
stochastic
simulations
.
We
find
the
key
parameters
to
be
the
rate
of
introduction
of
infection
and
the
rate
of
change
of
the
basic
reproductive
ratio
.
These
findings
aid
our
understanding
of
real
emergence

,
and
can
be
incorporated
into
early-warning

Since
its
emergence
in
the
late
1980
's
,
the
porcine
reproductive
and
respiratory
syndrome
virus
(
PRRSv
)
has
posed
a
significant
challenge
to
the
pig
industry
worldwide
.
Since
then
,
a
number
of
epidemiological
tools
have
been
created
to
support
control
and
eventual
elimination
of
the
disease
at
the
farm
and
regional
levels
.
Still
,
many
aspects
of
the
disease
dynamics
are
yet-to-be
elucidated
,
such
as
what
are
the
economically
optimal
control
strategies
at

,
what
is
the

may
play
,
how
to
optimize
the
use
of
molecular
tools
for
surveillance
and
monitoring
in

settings
,
what
is
the
full
impact
of
the
disease
in
a
farm
,
or
what
is
the
relative
contribution
of
alternative
transmission
routes
on
the
occurrence
of
PRRSv
outbreaks
.
Here
,
we
summarize
a
number
of
projects
demonstrating
the
use
of
novel
analytical
tools
in
the
assessment
of
PRRSv
epidemiology
in
the
United
States
.
Results
presented
demonstrate
how
quantitative
analysis
of
routinely
collected
data
may
help
in
understanding
regional
epidemiology
of
PRRSv
and
to
quantify
its
full
impact
,
and
how
the
integration
of
phylodynamic
methods
as
a
standard
tool
for
molecular
surveillance
of
PRRSv
might
help
to
inform
control
and
prevention
strategies
in
high-risk
epidemiological
situations
.
Ultimately
,
these
tools
will
help
to
support
PRRSv

West
Nile
virus
(
WNV
)
is
a
blood-borne
pathogen
that
causes
systemic
infections
and
serious
neurological
disease
in
human
and
animals
.
The
most
common
route
of
infection
is
mosquito
bites
and
therefore
,
the
virus
must
cross
a
number
of
polarized
cell
layers
to
gain
access
to
organ
tissue
and
the
central
nervous
system
.
Resistance
to
trans-cellular
movement
of
macromolecules
between
epithelial
and
endothelial
cells
is
mediated
by
tight
junction
complexes
.
While
a
number
of
recent
studies
have
documented
that
WNV
infection
negatively
impacts
the
barrier
function
of
tight
junctions
,
the
intracellular
mechanism
by
which
this
occurs
is
poorly
understood
.
In
the
present
study
,
we
report
that
endocytosis
of
a
subset
of
tight
junction
membrane
proteins
including
claudin-1
and
JAM-1
occurs
in
WNV
infected
epithelial
and
endothelial
cells
.
This
process
,
which
ultimately
results
in
lysosomal
degradation
of
the
proteins
,
is
dependent
on
the
GTPase
dynamin
and
microtubule-based
transport
.
Finally
,
infection
of
polarized
cells
with
the
related
flavivirus
,
Dengue
virus-2
,
did
not
result
in
significant
loss
of
tight
junction
membrane
proteins
.
These
results
suggest
that
neurotropic
flaviviruses
such
as
WNV
modulate
the
host
cell
environment
differently
than
hemorrhagic
flaviviruses
and
thus
may
have
implications
for
understanding
the
molecular
basis
for
neuroinvasion
.
The
2019
novel
coronavirus
disease
(
COVID-19
)
caused
by
severe
acute
respiratory
syndrome
coronavirus
2
(
SARS-CoV-2
)
has
spread
globally
,
while
the
routes
of
transmission
of
this
virus
are
still
controversial
.
We
enrolled
33
patients
,
without
any
ocular
manifestation
,
with
their
ocular
surface
swabs
collected
for
virus
detection
.
RNA
was
detected
strong
positive
in
samples
of
both
eyes
from
two
patients
.
Therefore
,
SARS-CoV-2
may
exist
in
the
normal
ocular
surface
of
COVID-19
patients
,
suggesting
that
this
virus
might
be
spread
through
conjunctival
contact
.

number
of

From

we
enrolled
191

adults
with

the

Five

had

,
indicating

Genotyping

High

were
significantly
more

,
compared
to
patients
with

.
Only
12
%
of

displayed

,
whereas
febrile
leukopenia
(
62.7

were
commonly
observed

Bats
are
source
of
coronaviruses
closely
related
to
the
severe
acute
respiratory
syndrome
(
SARS
)
virus
.
Numerous
studies
have
been
carried
out
to
identify
new
bat
viruses
related
to
SARS-coronavirus
(
bat-SARS-like
CoVs
)
using
a
reverse-transcribed-polymerase
chain
reaction
assay
.
However
,
a
qualitative
PCR
could
underestimate
the
prevalence
of
infection
,
affecting
the
epidemiological
evaluation
of
bats
in
viral
ecology
.
In
this
work
an
SYBR
Green-real
time
PCR
assay
was
developed
for
diagnosing
infection
with
SARS-related
coronaviruses
from
bat
guano
and
was
applied
as
screening
tool
in
a
survey
carried
out
on
45
greater
horseshoe
bats
(
Rhinolophus
ferrumequinum
)
sampled
in
Italy
in
2009
.
The
assay
showed
high
sensitivity
and
reproducibility
.
Its
application
on
bats
screening
resulted
in
a
prevalence
of
42
%
.
This
method
could
be
suitable
as
screening
tool
in
epidemiological
surveys
about
the
presence
of
bat-SARS-like
CoVs
,
consequently
to
obtain
a
more
realistic
scenario
of
the
viral
prevalence
in
the
population
.
RNA
viruses
cause
significant
human
pathology
and
are
responsible
for
the
majority
of
emerging
zoonoses
.
Mainstream
diagnostic
assays
are
challenged
by
their
intrinsic
diversity
,
leading
to
false
negatives
and
incomplete
characterisation
.
New
sequencing
techniques
are
expanding
our
ability
to
agnostically
interrogate
nucleic
acids
within
diverse
sample
types
,
but
in
the
clinical
setting
are
limited
by
overwhelming
host
material
and
ultra-low
target
frequency
.
Through
selective
host
RNA
depletion
and
compensatory
protocol
adjustments
for
ultra-low
RNA
inputs
,
we
are
able
to
detect
three
major
blood-borne
RNA
viruses
-HIV
,
HCV
and
HEV
.
We
recovered
complete
genomes
and
up
to
43
%
of
the
genome
from
samples
with
viral
loads
of
10
4
and
10
3
IU/ml
respectively
.
Additionally
,
we
demonstrated
the
utility
of
this
method
in
detecting
and
characterising
members
of
diverse
RNA
virus
families
within
a
human
plasma
background
,
some
present
at
very
low
levels
.
By
applying
this
method
to
a
patient
sample
series
,
we
have
simultaneously
determined
the
full
genome
of
both
a
novel
subtype
of
HCV
genotype
6
,
and
a
co-infecting
human
pegivirus
.
This
method
builds
upon
earlier
RNA
metagenomic
techniques
and
can
play
an
important
role
in
the
surveillance
and
diagnostics
of
blood-borne
viruses
.
Single-stranded
RNA
viruses
exhibit
exceptional
genetic
diversity
due
to
low
fidelity
replication
mechanisms

,

.
As
a
group
,
they
constitute
the
major
source
of
emerging
infections
in
humans
such
as
Ebola
,
chikungunya
,
Zika
,
West

virus
and
Middle

.
With
new
human
RNA
viruses
being
discovered
each

,
the
serological
and
nucleic
acid
amplification
techniques
that
have
dominated
virus
diagnostics
for
many
years
are
becoming
increasingly
unable
to
respond
to
the
ever-expanding
range
of
pathogens
.
In
parallel
,
there
is
a
substantial
global
burden
of
long-established
blood-borne
RNA
viruses
of
which
the
most
prevalent
are
human
immunodeficiency
virus
(
HIV
)
and
hepatitis
C
virus
(
HCV
)
,

over
38
million
and
at

100

people
worldwide
,
respectively

,

.
In
developed
countries
,
blood
and
transplant
products
are
routinely
screened
for
these
and
other
viruses
.
However
,
even
within
these
two
relatively
well-characterised
virus
species
,
new
genotypic
divisions
and
recombinant
variants
are
being
discovered
11-13
,
and
questions
have
been
raised
regarding
the
reliability
of
commercial
assays
in
detecting
new
strains
14-16
.
Isolated
from
humans
and
several
animal
hosts

Hepatitis

,
over
the
course
of
the

,
become
the
leading

worldwide
of
acute
viral
hepatitis
.
With
an
estimated
56,600

it

a
prime

of
an

In
the
absence
of
significant

depletion
,
genome
coverage
and
depths
are
often
low
even
at
high
viral
copy
numbers
20-23
.
Several
reports
detail
methods
for
partitioning
viral
and
host
material
through
physicochemical
purification
of
virus
particles
using
various
combinations
of
filtration
,
differential
centrifugation
,
precipitation
and
extra-virion
nuclease
digestion
prior
to
extraction

these
also
suffer
from
low
virus
read
frequency
and
consequent
low
depth
of
coverage
of
partial
genomes
24-27
.
The
most
frequent
alternative
method
is
to
selectively
eliminate
host
nucleic
acids
,
specifically
ribosomal
RNA
species
(
rRNA
)
,
as
they
constitute
approximately
80
%
of
total
cellular
RNA
.
'VIDISCA
'
is
one
such
approach
,
where
viral
nucleic
acids
are
preferentially
amplified
through
the
use
of
non-random
hexamers
that
do
not
complement
human
rRNA
sequences
.
In
combination
with
NGS
,
partial
genomes
of
novel
viruses
have
been
detected
by
this
method
28
,
29
.
As
with
non-depleting
methods
,
extensive
further
work
is
needed
to
fully
characterise
detected
viruses
,
and
when
applied
to
diagnostic
virology
,
the
read
depths
and
genome
coverages
remain
low
even
at
high
viral
loads
30-33
.
Most
groups
selectively
deplete
rRNA
by
hybridising
rRNA-specific
DNA
'scissor
probes
'
to
the
extracted
nucleic
acids
,
and
digesting
the
rRNA/DNA
duplexes

,

This
approach
has
been
exploited
to
good
effect

The
extremely
low
amounts
of

a
significant

,

In
this

have
established
a
sequence-independent
RNA
library
preparation
method
suitable
for
the
detection
and
characterization
of
blood-borne

The
method
is
focused
on
increasing
the
relative
abundance
of
viral
RNA
within
the
sample
,
during

after
the

extraction
process
,
with
a
specialised
library

step
able
to
process
ultra-low
RNA
inputs
.
The
RNA
enrichment
steps
enable
recovery
of
a
higher
proportion
of
reads
of
viral
origin
,
constituting
a
major
advance
in
making
virus
genome
assembly
less
challenging
,
leading
to
notable
improvements
in
sequencing

The
protocol
was
tested
in
complex
host-enriched
samples
containing
HCV
,
HIV
and
HEV
,
and
complete

were
recovered
from

A

of
the
protocol
to
detect

By
applying
the
method
to
a
series
of
samples
taken
from
an
HCV-infected
patient
,
we
have
demonstrated
the
utility

this

in
fully

of
HCV
together
with
the
complete

a
vital

of
the

plays
a
major
role
in
the
formation
of
host

membrane-derived

The

NS4A
(

is
known
to
preferentially

ISG20
is
a
broad
spectrum
antiviral
protein
thought
to
directly
degrade
viral
RNA
.
However
,
this
mechanism
of
inhibition
remains
controversial
.
Using
the
Vesicular
Stomatitis
Virus
(
VSV
)
as
a
model
RNA
virus
,
we
show
here
that
ISG20
interferes
with
viral
replication
by
decreasing
protein
synthesis
in
the
absence
of
RNA
degradation
.
Importantly
,
we
demonstrate
that
ISG20
exerts
a
translational
control
over
a
large
panel
of
non-self
RNA
substrates
including
those
originating
from
transfected
DNA
,
while
sparing
endogenous
transcripts
.
This
activity
correlates
with
the
protein
's
ability
to
localize
in
cytoplasmic
processing
bodies
.
Finally
,
these
functions
are
conserved
in
the
ISG20
murine
ortholog
,
whose
genetic
ablation
results
in
mice
with
increased
susceptibility
to
viral
infection
.
Overall
,
our
results
posit
ISG20
as
an
important
defense
factor
able
to

The

(
ISG20
)
is
an
RNA
exonuclease
endowed
with
broad
antiviral
properties
.
The
prevailing
mechanism
of
inhibition
described
for
ISG20
indicates
that
this
enzyme
is
capable
of
directly
degrading
viral
RNA
in
the
absence
of
apparent
sequence
specificity
.
This
mode
of
action
has
been
however
challenged
by
recent
studies
that
revealed
that
ISG20
could
target
specific
structures
on
the

virus
,
as
well
as
by
others
that
suggested
inhibition
in
the
absence
of

RNA
degradation

We
now
demonstrate
that
ISG20
interferes
with
viral
replication

However
,
ISG20

Background
:
Acute
respiratory

(
ARIs
)
are
a
great
public
health
challenge
globally
.
The
prevalence
of
respiratory
viruses
in
patients
with
ARIs
attending
at
different
hospital
settings
is
fully
undetermined
.
Methods
:
Laboratory-based
surveillance
for
ARIs
was
conducted
at
inpatient
and
outpatient
settings
of
11
hospitals
in
North
China
.
The
first
2-5
patients
with
ARIs
were
recruited
in
each
hospital
weekly
from
2012
through
2015
.
The
presence
of
respiratory
viruses
was
screened
by
PCR
assays
.
The
prevalence
of
respiratory
viruses
was
determined
and
compared
between

Results
:
A
total
of
3487
hospitalized

)
patients
were
enrolled
.
The
most
commonly
detected
viruses
in
the
hospitalized
cases
were
respiratory

Conclusions
:
A

which
might

Background
:
Acute
viral
respiratory
illnesses
in
children
in
sub-Saharan
Africa
have
received
relatively
little
attention
,
although
they
are
much
more
frequent
causes
of
morbidity
and
mortality
than
in
developed
countries
.
Most
of
the
individuals
infected
with
SARS
coronavirus
(
SARS-CoV
)
spontaneously
recovered
without
clinical
intervention
.
However
,
the
immunological
correlates
associated
with
patients
'
recovery
are
currently
unknown
.
In
this
report
,
we
have
sequentially
monitored
30
recovered
patients
over
a
two-year
period
to
characterize
temporal
changes
in
SARS-CoV-specific
antibody
responses
as
well
as
cytotoxic
T
cell
(
CTL
)
responses
.
We
have
found
persistence
of
robust
antibody
and
CTL
responses
in
all
of
the
study
subjects
throughout
the
study
period
,
with
a
moderate
decline
one
year
after
the
onset
of
symptoms
.
We
have
also
identified
two
potential
major
CTL
epitopes
in
N
proteins
based
on
ELISPOT
analysis
of
pooled
peptides
.
However
,
despite
the
potent
immune
responses
and
clinical
recovery
,
peripheral
lymphocyte
counts
in
the
recovered
patients
have
not
yet
been
restored
to
normal
levels
.
In
summary
,
our
study
has
,
for
the
first
time
,
characterized
the
temporal
and
dynamic
changes
of
humoral
and
CTL
responses
in
the
natural
history
of
SARS-recovered
individuals
,
and
strongly
supports
the
notion
that
high
and
sustainable
levels
of
immune
responses
correlate
strongly
with
the
disease
outcome
.
Our
findings
have
direct
implications
for
future
design
and
development
of
effective
therapeutic
agents
and
vaccines
against
SARS-CoV

Dengue
virus
is
an
emerging
infectious
agent
that
infects
an
estimated
50-100
million
people
annually
worldwide
,
yet
current
diagnostic
practices
can
not
detect
an
etiologic
pathogen
in
,40
%
of
dengue-like
illnesses
.
Metagenomic
approaches
to
pathogen
detection
,
such
as
viral
microarrays
and
deep
sequencing
,
are
promising
tools
to
address
emerging
and
non-diagnosable
disease
challenges
.
In
this
study
,
we
used
the
Virochip
microarray
and
deep
sequencing
to
characterize
the
spectrum
of
viruses
present
in
human
sera
from
123
Nicaraguan
patients
presenting
with
dengue-like
symptoms
but
testing
negative
for
dengue
virus
.
We
utilized
a
barcoding
strategy
to
simultaneously
deep
sequence
multiple
serum
specimens
,
generating
on
average
over
1
million
reads
per
sample
.
We
then
implemented
a
stepwise
bioinformatic
filtering
pipeline
to
remove
the
majority
of
human
and
low-quality
sequences
to
improve
the
speed
and
accuracy
of
subsequent
unbiased
database
searches
.
By
deep
sequencing
,
we
were
able
to
detect
virus
sequence
in
37
%
(
45/123
)
of
previously
negative
cases
.
These
included
13
cases
with
Human
Herpesvirus
6
sequences
.
Other
samples
contained
sequences
with
similarity
to
sequences
from
viruses
in
the
Herpesviridae
,
Flaviviridae
,
Circoviridae
,
Anelloviridae
,
Asfarviridae
,
and
Parvoviridae
families
.
In
some
cases
,
the
putative
viral
sequences
were
virtually
identical
to
known
viruses
,
and
in
others
they
diverged
,
suggesting
that
they
may
derive
from
novel
viruses
.
These
results
demonstrate
the
utility
of
unbiased
metagenomic
approaches
in
the
detection
of
known
and
divergent
viruses
in
the
study
of
tropical
febrile
illness
.
Immune
sera
from
convalescent
patients

the
treatment
of

infected
with

Respiratory

)
making
passive
immune
therapy
with
human
monoclonal
antibodies
an
attractive
treatment
strategy
for
SARS
.
Previously
,
using
Xenomouse
(

)
,
we
produced
a
panel
of
neutralizing
Human
monoclonal
antibodies
(
HmAbs
)
that
could
specifically
bind
to
the
ectodomain
of
the
SARS-CoV
spike
(
S
)
glycoprotein
.
Some
of
the
HmAbs
were
S1
domain
specific
,
while
some
were
not
.
In
this
study
,
we
describe
non-S1
binding
neutralizing
HmAbs
that
can
specifically
bind
to
the
conserved
S2
domain
of
the
S
protein
.
However
,
unlike
the
S1
specific
HmAbs
,
the
S2
specific
HmAbs
can
neutralize
pseudotyped
viruses
expressing
different
S
proteins
containing
receptor
binding
domain
sequences
of
various
clinical
isolates
.
These
data
indicate
that
HmAbs
which
bind
to
conserved
regions
of
the
S
protein
are
more
suitable
for
conferring
protection
against
a
wide
range
of
SARS-CoV
variants
and
have
implications
for
generating
therapeutic
antibodies
or
subunit
vaccines
against
other
enveloped
viruses

Aging

increased

.
The
many
different
biological
pathways
comprising
the
response
to
infection
in
lungs
that
are
influenced
by

are
complex
and
remain

more
thoroughly
.
Towards
finding
new
directions
in
research
on
aging
,
we
aimed
to
define
biological
pathways
in
the
acute
response
to
RSV
that
are
affected
in
the
lungs
by
aging
.
We
therefore
profiled
the
full
transcriptome
of
lung
tissue
of
mice
prior
to
and
during
RSV
infection
both
at
young
and
old
age
.
In
the
absence
of
RSV
,
we
found
aging
to
downregulate
genes
that
are
involved
in
constitution
of
the
extracellular
matrix
.
Moreover
,
uninfected
old
mice
showed
elevated
expression
of
pathways
that
resemble
injury
,
metabolic
aberrations
,
and
disorders
mediated
by
functions
of
the
immune
system
that
were
induced
at
young
age
only
by
an
exogenous
trigger
like
RSV
.
Furthermore
,
infection
by
RSV
mounted
stronger
activation
of
anti-viral
type-I
interferon
pathways
at
old
age
.
Despite
such
exaggerated
anti-viral
responses
,
old
mice
showed
reduced
control
of
virus
.
Altogether
,
our
findings
emphasize
important
roles
in
aging-related
susceptibility
to
respiratory
disease
for
extracellular
matrix
dysfunctions
and
dysregulated
immune
activation
in
lungs
.
Old
age
poses
an
increased
risk
for
severe
disease
of
the
airways
caused
by
respiratory
syncytial
virus
(
RSV
)
.
In
the
elderly
population
it
has
been
estimated
that
numbers
of
hospitalization
due
to
RSV
infection
may
reach
close
to
the
numbers
of
respiratory
illness
caused
by
influenza
viruses
1-3
.
In
mice
,
RSV
has
been
shown
to
cause
more
lung
pathology
at
old
age
,
but
the
different
mechanisms
comprising
the
response
to
infection
that
are
influenced
by
aging
of
the
lung
tissue
largely
remain
to
be
defined
.
Studies
on
the
full
transcriptome
in
young
adult
mice
have
shown
that
the
response
to
RSV
at
the
site
of
infection
is
complex
as
it
involves
many
different
biological
pathways
4,5
.
Altered
antiviral
expression
of
some
genes
in
lung
due
to
aging
6,7
and
increased
susceptibility
to
infectious
diseases
indicate
the
involvement
of
unique
age-related
features
that
should
be
considered
towards
understanding
disease
at
old
age
.
However
,
effects
of
aging
on
the
full
RSV-induced
transcription
profile
in
lungs
have
remained
elusive
.
In
our
study
,
we
determined
the
full
transcription
profile
in
the
lungs
during
infection
with
RSV
to
provide
a
more
comprehensive
exploration
of
the
consequences
of
old
age
on
gene
expression
.
Increased
susceptibility
to
disease
caused
by
RSV
in
the
elderly
has
largely
been
ascribed
to
age-related
decline
of
the
levels
of
protective
antibodies
and
memory
function
of
cells
of
the

.
Infection
due
to
this
lack
of
acquired
RSV-specific
immunity
implies
a
prominent
role
for
direct
innate
anti-viral
immune
mechanisms
that
are
activated
in
infected
tissue
in
order
to
control
the

.
A
prominent
role
for
innate
responses
has
been
exemplified
by
a
study
that
shows
genetic
susceptibility
to
RSV-induced
bronchiolitis
in
children
being
predominantly
associated
with
innate
immune
genes

Moreover

is
associated
with
a
decrease
in
neopterin
levels
.
Elevated
neopterin
levels
were
associated
with
hepatitis
by
hepatitis
A
,
B
,
and
C
viruses
.
Serum
neopterin
levels
were
found
to
be
a
predictor
of
response
to
treatment
of
chronic
HCV
infection
with
pegylated
interferon
combined
with
ribavirin
.
Neopterin
levels
of
patients
with
pulmonary
tuberculosis
were
found
to
be
higher
in
patients
with
more
extensive
radiological
changes
.
Elimination
of
blood
donors
with
elevated
neopterin
levels
to
reduce
risk
of
transmission
of
infections
with
known
and
unknown
viral
pathogens
has
been
undertaken
.
Neopterin
measurement
is
hereby
more
cost
effective
but
less
sensitive
than
screening
using
polymerase
chain
reaction
based
assays
.
In
conclusion
neopterin
is
a
nonspecific
marker
of
activated
T-helper
cell
1
dominated
immune
response
.
It
may
be
a
useful
marker
for
monitoring
of
infectious
disease
activity
during
treatment
and
for
more
accurate
estimation
of
extent
of
disease
and
prognosis
.
Numerous
peripheral
tissues
possess
self-sustaining
daily
biologic
rhythms
that
are
regulated
at
the
molecular
level
by
clock
genes
such
as
PER1
,
PER2
,
CLOCK
,
and
BMAL1
.
Physiological
function
of
nasal
mucosa
exhibits
rhythmic
variability
to
a
day-night
environmental
cycle
.
Nevertheless
,
little
is
known
of
the
expression
and
distribution
pattern
of
clock
genes
in
nasal
mucosa
.
The
present
study
investigates
the
expression
level
and
distribution
pattern
of
PER1
,
PER2
,
CLOCK
,
and
BMAL1
genes
in
nasal
mucosa
of
healthy
controls
,
allergic
rhinitis
patients
,
and
normal
rats
.
In
human
and
rat
nasal
mucosa
,
the
levels
of
these
genes
are
asymmetrically
expressed
in
nasal
mucosa
derived
from
right
and
left
cavities
in
normal
controls
,
allergic
patients
,
and
rat
.
In
human
nasal
mucosa
,
the
expression
levels
of
these
genes
were
higher
in
the
decongested
side
than
the
congested
mucosa
.
In
rat
nasal
mucosa
,
these
clock
genes
are
expressed
in
a
rhythmic
circadian
manner
under
the
regular
light/dark
cycles
.
The
expression
levels
of
MUC5AC
,
a
key
mucin
genes
produced
in
superficial
epithelium
,
are
higher
in
decongested
side
than
that
congested
side
in
human
nasal
mucosa
.
In
rat
nasal
mucosa
,
MUC5AC
levels
showed
a
circadian
rhythm
which
was
associated
with
different
expression
levels
in
nasal
mucosa
derived
from
the
right
and
left
nasal
cavities
.
Taken
together
with
these
results
,
the
present
study
shows
that
the
clock
genes
such
as
PER1
,
PER2
,
CLOCK
,
and
BMAL1
are
present
in
human
and
rat
nasal
mucosa
,
and
suggest
that
these
clock
genes
may
control
the
pathophysiological
function
of
nasal
mucosa
as
circadian
oscillators
and
affect
the
maintenance
of
the
nasal
cycle
.
Porcine
transmissible
gastroenteritis
virus
(
TGEV
)
and
porcine
epidemic
diarrhea
virus
(
PDEV
)
can
cause
severe
diarrhea
in
pigs
.
Development
of
effective
vaccines
against
TGEV
and
PEDV
is
one
of
important
prevention
measures
.
The
spike
(
S
)
protein
is
the
surface
glycoprotein
of
TGEV
and
PEDV
,
which
can
induce
specific
neutralization
antibodies
and
is
a
candidate
antigen
for
vaccination
attempts
.
In
this
study
,
the
open
reading
frames
of
the
TGEV
S1
protein
and
in
addition
of
the
S
or
S1
proteins
of
PEDV
were
inserted
into
the
eukaryotic
expression
vector
,
pIRES
,
resulting
in
recombinant
plasmids
,
pIRES-
(
TGEV-S1-PEDV-S1
)
and
pIRES-
(
TGEV-S1-PEDV-S
)
.
Subsequently
,
6-8
weeks
old
Kunming
mice
were
inoculated
with
both
DNA
plasmids
.
Lymphocyte
proliferation
assay
,
virus
neutralization
assay
,
IFN-c
assay
and
CTL
activity
assay
were
performed
.
TGEV/PEDV
specific
antibody
responses
as
well
as
kinetic
changes
of
T
lymphocyte
subgroups
of
the
immunized
mice
were
analyzed
.
The
results
showed
that
the
recombinant
DNA
plasmids
increased
the
proliferation
of
T
lymphocytes
and
the
number
of
CD4+
and
CD8+
T
lymphocyte
subgroups
.
In
addition
,
the
DNA
vaccines
induced
a
high
level
of
IFN-c
in
the
immunized
mice
.
The
specific
CTL
activity
in
the
pIRES-
(
TGEV-S1-PEDV-S
)
group
became
significant
at
42
days
postimmunization
.
At
35
days
post-immunization
,
the
recombinant
DNA
plasmids
bearing
full-length
S
genes
of
TGEV
and
PEDV
stimulated
higher
levels
of
specific
antibodies
and
neutralizing
antibodies
in
immunized
mice
.
Several
technologies
have
been
developed
to
isolate
human
antibodies
against
different
target
antigens
as
a
source
of
potential
therapeutics
,
including
hybridoma
technology
,
phage
and
yeast
display
systems
.
For
conventional
antibodies
,
this
involves
either
random
pairing
of
VH
and
variable
light
(
VL
)
domains
in
combinatorial
display
libraries
or
isolation
of
cognate
pairs
of
VH
and
VL
domains
from
human
B
cells
or
from
transgenic
mice
carrying
human
immunoglobulin
loci
followed
by
single-cell
sorting
,
single-cell
RT-PCR
,
and
bulk
cloning
of
isolated
natural
VH-VL
pairs
.
Heavy-chain-only
antibodies
(
HCAbs
)
that
naturally
occur
in
camelids
require
only
heavy
immunoglobulin
chain
cloning
.
Here
,
we
present
an
automatable
novel
,
high-throughput
technology
for
rapid
direct
cloning
and
production
of
fully
human
HCAbs
from
sorted
population
of
transgenic
mouse
plasma
cells
carrying
a
human
HCAb
locus
.
Utility
of
the
technique
is
demonstrated
by
isolation
of
diverse
sets
of

Viruses
are
lifeless
particles
designed
for
setting
virus-host
interactome
assuring
a
new
generation
of
virions
for
dissemination
.
This
interactome
generates
a
pressure
on
host
organisms
evolving
mechanisms
to
neutralize
viral
infection
,
which
places
the
pressure
back
onto
virus
,
a
process
known
as
virus-host

Positive-single
stranded
RNA
(
+sRNA
)
viruses
are
an
important
group
of
viral
agents
illustrating
this
interesting
phenomenon
.
During
replication
,
their
genomic
+sRNA
is
employed
as
template
for
translation
of
viral
proteins
;
among
them
the
RNA-dependent
RNA
polymerase
(
RdRp
)
is
responsible
of
viral
genome
replication
originating
double-strand
RNA
molecules
(
dsRNA
)
as
intermediates
,
which
accumulate
representing
a
potent
threat
for
cellular
dsRNA
receptors
to
initiate
an
antiviral
response
.
A
common
feature
shared
by
these
viruses
is
their
ability
to
rearrange
cellular
membranes
to
serve
as
platforms
for
genome
replication
and
assembly
of
new
virions
,
supporting
replication
efficiency
increase
by
concentrating
critical
factors
and
protecting
the
viral
genome
from
host
anti-viral
systems
.
This
review
summarizes
current
knowledge
regarding
cellular
dsRNA
receptors
and
describes
prototype
viruses
developing
replication
niches
inside
rearranged
membranes
.
However
,
for
several
viral
agents
it
's
been
observed
both
,
a
complex
rearrangement
of
cellular
membranes
and
a
strong
innate
immune
antiviral
response
induction
.
So
,
we
have
included
recent
data
explaining
the
mechanism
by
,
even
though
viruses
have
evolved
elegant
hideouts
,
host
cells
are
still
able
to
develop
dsRNA
receptors-dependent
antiviral
response
.
Diseases
caused
by
bacterial
infections
in
small-scale
and
industrial
livestock
are
becoming
serious
global
health
concern
in
veterinary
science
.
Zoonotic
bacteria
,
including
Staphylococcus
,
Campylobacter
,
and
Bartonella
species
,
that
infect
animals
and
humans
cause
various
illnesses
,
such
as
fever
,
diarrhea
,
and
related
complications
.
Bacterial
diseases
in
animals
can
be
treated
with
various
classes
of
antibiotics
,
including
fluoroquinolones
,
beta-lactams
,
aminoglycosides
,
and
macrolides
.
However
,
the
overuse
and
misuse
of
antibiotics
have
led
to
drug
resistance
in
infectious
agents
,
e.g.
,
methicillin-resistant
Staphylococcus
;
this
hampers
the
treatment
of
infections
in
livestock
,
and
such
problems
are
increasing
worldwide
.
Dietary
phytochemicals
and
herbal
medicines
are
useful
and
viable
alternatives
to
pharmaceuticals
because
they
are
economical
,
effective
,
non-resistance-forming
,
renewable
,
and
environmentally
friendly
.
They
are
small
molecules
with
high
structural
diversity
that
cause
selective
stress
to
or
stimulation
of
resident
microbiota
,
consequently
causing
an
abundance
of
such
microorganisms
;
thus
,
they
can
be
used
in
preventing
various
diseases
,
ranging
from
metabolic
and
inflammatory
diseases
to
cancer
.
In
addition
,
the
antioxidant
effects
of
phytochemicals
prevent
substantial
losses
in
the
livestock
industry
by
increasing
animal
fertility
and
preventing
diseases
.
Potentially
effective
plant
extracts
could
be
used
in
combination
with
antibiotics
to
decrease
the
required
dose
of
antibiotics
and
increase
their
effectiveness
.
This
strategy
can
help
avoid
the
side
effects
of
chemical
antimicrobials
and
allow
the
effective
use
of
phytochemicals
for
treating
diseases
.
Furthermore
,
phytochemicals
are
considered
as
potential
alternatives
to
antibiotics
because
of
their
economical
,
non-resistance-forming
and
environmentally
friendly
properties
.
Flavonoids
such
as
resveratrol
,
epigallocatechin
gallate
,
and
phenols
such
as
galangin
,
puerarin
,
and
ursolic
acid
are
proven
to
be
effective
as
antimicrobial
agents
.
This
review
provides
invaluable
information
about
the
types
of
microbial
infections
in
animals
and
the
current
knowledge
on
phytotherapeutic
agents
classified
by
their
mode
of
actions
