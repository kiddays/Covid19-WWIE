When O

we O
identified O

We O
conclude O
that O

linked O
to O
tight O
spatial O

so O
crucially O

..... O
We O
have O
developed O
a O
high-resolution O
genomic O

technique O
that O
combines O
transposon-mediated O
insertional O
mutagenesis O
with O
either O
capillary O

identify O
functionally O

We O
initially O
used O

gain O
insight O

the O
role O
of O
the O
VEEV O

( O

in O
viral O

..... O
We O
identified O
several O
regions O
in O
nsP3 O
that O
are O
intolerant O
to O
small O
( O
15 O

) O
insertions O
, O
and O
thus O
are O
presumably O
functionally O
important O
. O
..... O
We O
also O
identified O
nine O

regions O
in O
nsP3 O
that O
will O
tolerate O
small O
insertions O
at O
low O
temperatures O
( O
30uC O
) O
, O
but O
not O
at O
higher O
temperatures O
( O
37uC O
, O

..... O
Because O
we O

this O

to O
be O
extremely O
effective O
at O
identifying O

sensitive O
( O

) O
mutations O
, O
but O
limited O
by O
capillary O
electrophoresis O
capacity O
, O
we O
replaced O
the O
capillary O
electrophoresis O
with O
massively O

sequencing O
and O
used O
the O
improved O
method O
to O
generate O
a O
functional O
map O
of O
the O
entire O
VEEV O
genome O
. O
..... O
We O
identified O
several O
hundred O
potential O

mutations O
throughout O
the O
genome O

we O
validated O
several O
of O
the O
mutations O
in O

with O

generated O
through O

..... O
We O
further O
demonstrated O
that O
two O
of O
the O
nsP3 O
ts O
mutants O
were O
attenuated O
for O
virulence O
in O
mice O
but O
could O
elicit O
protective O

We O

Methods O
: O
We O

an O

Results O
: O
Here O
we O
show O
that O
PLpro O
also O
inhibits O

step O

that O
this O

on O
the O

We O
found O
that O

block O

Conclusion O

These O

demonstrate O
an O

, O

by O
the O

Hence O
, O
we O
discuss O
how O
flaviviruses O
modulate O
retinal O

response O
and O
breach O
the O
protective O
BRB O
to O
cause O
ocular O
or O

. O
..... O
Finally O
, O
we O
describe O

discuss O
whether O
these O
system O
biology-predicted O

( O

could O
contribute O

In O

has O

an O

appreciation O

the O
importance O

secreted O

Vimentin O

Recently O

Our O

The O

can O
be O
seen O
for O
up O
to O
10 O
hours O
where O
after O
the O

that O

To O

the O

. O
..... O
The O
importance O
of O
vimentin-mediated O
processes O
was O
underestimated O
for O
years O
, O
mainly O
because O
vimentin O
deficient O
( O

..... O
Eventually O
, O
more O
detailed O
studies O
on O

revealed O
that O

the O

How O
the O
vimentin-mediated O
processes O
are O
regulated O
remains O
elusive O

it O
seems O
that O
vimentin O
is O
a O
highly O
dynamic O

Vimentin O
