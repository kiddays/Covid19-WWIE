Conclusions/Significance O
: O
We O
conclude O
that O
there O
are O
no O
insurmountable O
problems O
to O
canine O
rabies O
control O
in O
most O
of O
Africa O
; O
that O
elimination O
of O
canine O
rabies O
is O
epidemiologically O
and O
practically O
feasible O
through O
mass O
vaccination O
of O
domestic O
dogs O
; O
and O
that O
domestic O
dog O
vaccination O
provides O
a O
cost-effective O
approach O
to O
the O
prevention O
and O
elimination O
of O
human O
rabies O
deaths O

Together O
with O
the O
Gag B-protein
protein E-protein
, O
the O
Env B-protein
glycoprotein E-protein
is O
a O
major O
retroviral B-protein
structural I-protein
protein E-protein
and O
is O
essential O
for O
forming O
infectious O
virus O
particles O
. O
Env S-protein
is O
synthesized O
, O
processed O
, O
and O
transported O
to O
certain O
microdomains O
at O
the O
plasma O
membrane O
and O
takes O
advantage O
of O
the O
same O
host O
machinery O
for O
its O
trafficking O
as O
that O
used O
by O
cellular B-protein
glycoproteins E-protein
. O
Incorporation O
of O
Env S-protein
into O
progeny O
virions O
is O
probably O
mediated O
by O
the O
interaction O
between O
Env S-protein
and O
Gag S-protein
, O
in O
some O
cases O
with O
the O
additional O
involvement O
of O
certain O
host O
factors O
. O
Although O
several O
general O
models O
have O
been O
proposed O
to O
explain O
the O
incorporation O
of O
retroviral B-protein
Env I-protein
glycoproteins E-protein
into O
virions O
, O
the O
actual O
mechanism O
for O
this O
process O
is O
still O
unclear O
, O
partly O
because O
structural O
data O
on O
the O
Env B-protein
protein I-protein

is O
lacking O
. O

We O

the O

Methods O
: O
This O

was O
based O
on O
data O
from O
a O
nationwide O
survey O
, O
which O
included O
2712 O
county-level O

. O
The O
distribution O
of O

was O
evaluated O
by O

inequalities O
at O

were O
decomposed O
to O
identify O
the O
root O

of O
inequalities O
in O
the O
PHW O
. O
Additionally O
, O
the O
contextual O
factors O

the O
distribution O
of O
the O
PHW O
were O
determined O
through O

. O
Results O
: O
The O
overall O

show O
that O
health O

faced O
worse O
inequality O
than O

. O
In O
particular O
, O
field O
epidemiological O
investigators O
had O
a O
Gini O
coefficient O
close O
to O
0.4 O
. O
Step O
decomposition O
showed O
that O
within-region O
inequalities O
accounted O
for O
98.5 O
% O
or O
more O
of O
overall O
inter-county O
inequality O
in O
the O
distribution O
of O
all O
PHW O
categories O
; O
provincial O
decomposition O
showed O
that O
at O
least O
74 O
% O
of O
inequality O
is O
still O
distributed O
within O
provinces O
; O
the O
overall O
contribution O
of O
within-municipal O
inequality O
and O
between-municipal O
inequality O
was O
basically O
the O
same O
. O
Further O
, O
the O
contextual O
factor O
that O
influenced O
betweenmunicipality O

within-municipality O
inequality O
for O
all O
three O

except O
for O

inequality O
of O

. O
Conclusions O
: O
The O
successive O
decomposition O
showed O
that O
inequality O
is O
mainly O
concentrated O
in O
counties O
at O
the O
within-province O

that O

Here O
we O

our O

The O

Although O
an O

a O

Thus O

the O

Furthermore O

To O

We O

that O

Natural B-protein

Some O

the O

To O
determine O
if O
the O

, O
we O
placed O

Since O

this O

The O
results O
suggest O
that O
PR B-protein

facilitated O

lead O
to O

Our O
conclusion O
is O
that O
placement O
of O
a O
heterologous B-protein
dimerization I-protein
domain E-protein
downstream O
of O
PR S-protein
enhances O

that O

We O

. O
The O
most O

route O

cross O
a O

the O

In O

report O
that O

This O
process O
, O
which O
ultimately O
results O
in O
lysosomal O

on O

Finally O
