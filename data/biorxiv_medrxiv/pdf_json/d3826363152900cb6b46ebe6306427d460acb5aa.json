In this study, relations are assumed to be linear, when, initially the drawn plot shows obvious linear relations and secondly, the fitted linear regression line had a small enough error to preserve the values given and the linear regression results could be interpreted with relative ease. In addition, by fitting regression lines with higher order, causes overfitting, resulting from the amount of data. There is no evidence yet, about the relation of other conditions to the outbreak and its case fatality rate (CFR), so by using linear regression line, policies and behaviors could be compared. In the prediction cases, by using linear regression, we could compare future trends of countries in earlier stages, with the ones in later stages. By considering above mentioned statements, we will find the best linear relation between arrays of data. In some cases, the linear relation could be observed but it may exhibit linear relation with some date shift of others (i.e. death cases should have linear relation with earlier values of confirmed cases, given the fact that it should take time from confirmation to death.)

Death cases are excessively lower than confirmed ones, so we normalized (By dividing the value of Confirmed, Deaths and Recovered cases to their maximum respectively) it in Fig. 2c to investigate all three trends of cases. For the confirmed cases, there is a huge increase since Feb 11, the increase tones down from Feb 11 to the next day, Furthermore on Feb 13 another sharp increase is reported. It could be observed in Fig. 2b which shows new cases for each day (and normalized in Fig. 2d ). The most reliable speculation for this jump is that in that day, China (the country with the most confirmed cases) for the first time, reported the clinically diagnosed cases in addition to laboratory-confirmed cases [17] , in which 13332 clinically diagnosed cases are added to 1148 laboratory-confirmed ones. Since then, China has kept the same reporting method for the confirmed cases. On 23rd and 24th of Feb, again the decrease of new cases subsided and new cases increased as before. As shown in Fig. 2a the reduction trend is continued (approximately) and the cause of the increase was other countries' growing numbers.

By adding these two values, 11.6 days after Jan 24 (4th and 5th of Feb) the effects should be clearly manifesting. Figure 3b depicted the new daily confirmed cases of China outside of Hubei. The peak of the plot is located on Feb 13 and the daily new cases reduces afterward. This reduction shows that the lockdown plays a serious role in the further reduction of cases in China(excluding Hubei province). Even Though there is no reason to argue the lockdown's positive impact on Hubei itself, the decrease in new confirmed cases (Feb 13 increase's rationale was described in the previous section) shows that emergency circumstances and movement limitations yields positive results to the reduction 5 .

            "text": "The number of deaths is far lower than confirmed cases. So, to investigate the relation of confirmed cases trend with the CFR, the normalized plot will be investigated. By observing normalized Hubei province plot of confirmed deaths and recovered cases in Fig. 3k , it could be seen that the CFR trend behaves the same as the confirmation, with a shift (In date). Visually, it could be seen that the value of shift in date varies and increases during this time. In earlier cases, the period of confirmation cases leading to death was shorter. It seems, one reason for this variation is, that confirmed cases consist only of just laboratory cases, and by adding clinically diagnosed cases (which existed before but didn't count beforehand) the time of confirmation to death increases. In other words, the number of confirmed cases gets closer to the real value, and the cases are announced sooner than they did before. Other possible reasons include, the advancements in developing treatments, further delaying fatal cases, and the increase in public awareness, as more people with possible signs of infection come forward to be diagnosed. To estimate the expected value of confirming a case up to the death stage, assuming a linear relation between the death and confirmed rates, we draw a linear regression line for confirmed and death cases' value, each time increasing the duration and finding the mean absolute error (MAE) of the regression line. Normally, by increasing the duration, following the reduction in investigated points, the MAE is reduced. However if there is an obvious relation between these two parameters, at the point which they had a correlating relation, MAE will begin to increase (Fig. 4a ). Wang et al. estimated the time from the the appearance of first symptoms to dyspnea was 5.0 days, to hospital admission 7.0 days, and to ARDS 8.0 days [20] . Another study, found that the median days from the first symptom to death as 14 (range 6-41) days [21] . As seen in Fig. 4c this value is about 11 days in China (excluding Hubei province), Fig. 4e depicted the value 7 for Hubei and Fig. 4a depicted value is 9 days for China. Assuming the hospital admission is the same day as confirmation (or a day before confirmation) the mean total of 14 days from the first symptom could be approved in [21] . By finding the mean day from confirmation to death, it is possible to find out the CFR in China, Hubei and China(excluding Hubei province) (algorithm 1 reports best shifting date value and best linear regression line). To find CFR of April 5 for Hubei, confirmed cases on April 5 should be divided by the death cases of 7 days prior (which is March 29) returning 4.7%. Calculating CFR for China (excluding Hubei) on April 5, follows as confirmed cases on the same day divided by death cases of 11 days before that date that equals 0.9%; Finally, for China's CFR on April 5, dividing April 5 confirmed cases by death ones of 9 days prior (March 11) yields 4%.",

By comparing recovered cases with confirmed ones, a relation is observed after date shifts. Unlike death cases, recovered cases' shift are longer initially, and reduces over time. The assumed reasoning is that by the passing of time, more medical treatments develop, healthcare providers gain more experience in handling patients' care and as more people are informed, increasing numbers of them check in hospitals at the early stages of their disease, resulting in an even more efficient treatment. However this reduction doesn't break the linear relation between confirmed cases and recovered ones enough to be significant. To find the mean date shift between confirmed cases and recovered ones, we apply a linear regression line to different dates by shifting them back until a first local minimum MAE is found(algorithm 1). Hubei province's recovered mean duration value found is 17 days Fig. 4f , the same value for China(excluding Hubei province) is 19 days Fig. 4d , and finally for China it's 18 days Fig. 4b . To find out the recovered cases ratio of Hubei province at April 5th, recovered cases of April 5 are divided by confirmed cases of 17 days prior resulting in 94%. Same calculation applies for China (excluding Hubei) 99%, and finally for China 95%.",

COVID-19 spreads from human to human [22] , therefore in addition to isolation of people, social avoidance and quarantine policies, faster detection of infected cases should reduce further growth. Each infected individual, by having contact with others directly or by proxy, (in other words by activity) could infect a number of people, so to reduce the odds of transmission of virus, faster detection of infected individuals could play a key role alongside lockdown strategies. Based on the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC), as of March 8th 2020, a total number of 188,518 cases have been screened and tested for HCoV infection [23] . More than 10,000 tests had been taken on March 8th, and just in two days, this number has reached to 210,144 (indicating more than 20,000 tests had been taken in 2 days). At this date, South Korea reached to 4099 taken-tests per million people. The magnitude of this number clearly shows the policy of South Korea, an attempt to reduce the duration of detection, through a faster detection strategy [24] . Furthermore, the fact that the CFR in the old South Korean affected adults [25] (patients above 70 years) is still lower than that of Italian HCoV affected patients (average 47 years old), better signifies the role of early detection in controlling the epidemic.",

To demonstrate a wrong approach, if dividing the death cases by confirmed ones on a specific date, yield the wrong answers, for the death cases might have been confirmed some day prior. By assuming that CFR has a linear (or near linear) relation with confirmed rate, duration of confirmation to death could be evaluated by fitting multiple linear regression lines. Minimum value for MAE appears for 5 days shift (for South Korea), meaning death cases were confirmed 5 days before. To discern the CFR of South Korea, total death cases should be divided by total confirmed date of 5 days prior (slope of the regression line also shows the rate). As alluded to before, there are many types of COVID-19 with respect to acuteness of the disease. The CFR varies depending on the level of infected people already confirmed. If a country manages to diagnose and confirm the affection of a patient, in an earlier stage and begins curating the infected individuals, or tallying those with mild COVID-19, the CFR would be comparatively lower. Such percussion alludes to the apparent lower CFRs in South Korea (1.8%) versus other countries with comparably large outbreaks.",

However, it wouldn't be possible unless most dead cases are confirmed after death. Accepting the 3 days for the US (see Fig.6g ), the CFR should be about 4%. The high CFR could be alluded to the detection of the infected individuals during the last stages of the illness, or reporting on serious cases with higher CFRs exclusively. Compared to China, Iran, Italy and South Korea, both confirmed and death cases of the US shows higher orders of incrementation. Comparing the increment rate of countries, the US seems to be in an earlier stage compared to China (outbreak is nearly ended), South Korea (at the ending stage), and Italy (passing the peak of the outbreak). Experimentally, for COVID-19 most of the countries in which the pandemic happened, (if the strategy does not change many times) two phases of the outbreak could be introduced. The first one is when the virus spreads increasingly (in each day new cases are more than previous), and the second one is the controlling outbreak in which new cases reduced to near zero. The US is now in the spreading phase (new confirmed and death cases depicted in Fig. 6e and Fig.6f) , the more reduction in new cases would cost more, and a trend with more slope costs more to be flattening. China and South Korea passed the fist phase and currently (April 5) it seems they are at the near end of the second stage. The experience of these two countries shows that the second phase will add about 150% of the first stage's cases but it also could varied depending on the taken strategies. Considering this calculation, each day in the first phase adds about 2.5 times the new cases on that date in total. Note that, these two phases could be repeated in a country more than once. It is advisable to follow the US in the coming days for more accurate information gathering, considering the latest increment could be caused by wrong data in the previous dates.",

To analyze the stage of the disease in the Italian HCoV infected patients (i.e., to find out how rapid the infected people have been screened and diagnosed), the results of the COVID-19 tests of Italy and South Korea can be compared. South Korea has been considered as a reference as its HCoV-related CFR is low enough, indicating that both countries are at the same level of HCoV infection. Till March 10th 2020, a total of 60,761 HCoV tests had been taken form Italians' through their screening program, where as in South Korea this number exceeds 210,144 tests, more than 3 folds. However, the number of the daily taken tests in Italy has been increasing, i.e., it was 13000 on March 11th [26] . On March 9, a national quarantine was imposed by the Italian government in which any movement of population has been restricted except necessary ones. Consequently, 11 days later the increase of new cases in Italy stopped, and it seems Italy is in changing-phase days.",

Calculating the total CFR of Italy (confirmation to death duration calculated as 4 days) about 14.5% of confirmed cases passed away. Compared to South Korea's rate of 1.8% (8 times than Italy) and China's 4% (72% lower than Italy), the CFR of Italy is too high. Ignoring race and climate as conditions (in which there is no clue of their impact), there should exist a strong rationale for this difference. One hypothesis is that some infected individuals are not diagnosed until later more serious stages of the disease. This could also explain the increase in confirmed cases, suggesting those infected, remain in contact with others. By comparing hospital beds per 10000 people, the indicator was 115.32 (At 2014), 42 (At 2012) and 34.22 (At 2012)(Iran 15 2014) for South Korea, China and Italy, respectively [27] . Statistically, it is observed that the CFR of COVID-19 has had a direct relation with age (with the average age of death for these 3 countries respectively 28, 38 and 47 years old [28] ) and It also potentially contributes to the increase in CFRs.",

Officially, Iran hasn't mandated any city wide lockdowns, but recently some provinces are refusing non-local travelers. Regarding the experiences in China, lockdown strategy will isolate cities to avoid transmitting the growth rate to other cities. However, such policies entail some negative consequences, and therefore they were not implemented in early stages of the outbreak in Iran; in contrast to Italy and South Korea, where there was a gap between outbreak and huge outbreak (21 and 27 days).

Linear regression algorithms shows the date shift should be zero, which means on average, death cases confirmed at the same day. By comparing the death trend with confirmed cases in Fig. 9b , it is obvious that the trend of CFR was not linear. The reported death vs confirmed are too excessive at early days. It is possible that the shortage of COVID-19 testing kits or/and the lack of clinical diagnosis approach caused such unreliable data. Countries at this stage mostly had about 7 days of confirmation to death period, so following this assumption the COVID-19's CFR in Iran is around 9.4%. By observing the 24th of Feb's report, there were 49 active cases (The cases which are not recovered or dead but confirmed as a COVID-19 infected) reported (at least 14 cases are new) and the value for active cases in the next day was 79 (at least 30 new cases). Two days later, the reported recovered cases was 49. Supposing no one was treated in less than two days, this results in 100% recovery of 14 new cases in two days and also no active cases after two days, marking a great experience which was reported by Iran's officials. Otherwise, some cases were treated in one day. This makes Iran's phenomena intriguing for investigating the details and contributing factors for such cases in order to find a relation between individual's physical conditions and their treatment period. However, errors in report could also explain this information. Using regression line to find the mean recovered duration shows that the recovery duration for Iran should be around 1 day, Also seen in Fig. 9c , the rate of recovery in Iran is quite significant at 37%. The 20th day of the outbreak, a temporal reduction in new cases could be observed starting on 6th of March persisting until 9th of March. Evidently, it is the impact of a nation wide implemented policy reducing working hours 6 days prior (5.4 days is the mean incubation period [18] ). After 4 days, with the arrival of weekends and the following 2 additional holidays. Reports indicate, many people took trips during these dates which is widely assumed as a reason for confirmed cases' rise. Although many companies implemented forms of remote work for their employees (which is estimated to have a positive impact on preventing the growth outbreak), yet many governmental office working hours returned to their pre-outbreak times (naturally assumed to negatively impact the prevention of disease's spread ).",

South Korea, is one of the first countries reporting the cases after China and the growth pattern of confirmed cases is the same as China's. However, they implement some policies such as in addition to isolation of people, social avoidance and quarantine policies for infected, and faster detection of infected cases which were effective in decrease in new confirmed case and also case fatality. Italy and China have the approximately same growth rate patterns for first 14 days. Lockdown strategy of Lombardy (the center of outbreak in Italy) seems to have had a positive effect on other municipalities. Unlike to China's growth pattern, Iran's incremental trend continued to rise until the 20th day of the outbreak, Even Though a temporal reduction in new cases could be observed due to a nation wide implemented policy reducing working hours. The case fatality rate in China was 4% (for Hubei was 4.7%). The highest and the lowest case fatality rates belong to Italy (14.3%), and South Korea (1.8%), respectively. Which could represent the effectiveness of their policies in control of the COVID-19. The US has more than a quarter of confirmed cases. It seems the leading country in confirmed cases of COVID-19 should propose a new policy to reduce new cases and go to the next phase of the pandemic. Social distancing was one of the most effective policies to control past epidemic disease by limitation human to human transmission and reducing mortality and morbidity ( [29] , [30] , [30] ). However studies suggest that combination of multiple policies can boost the effectiveness. For instance, New York City Department of Health implement different policies during the influenza pandemic in 1918-19 at the same time and they have the lowest rate of mortality on the eastern seaboard of the US [31] . During COVID-19 outbreak, researchers predicted that the mass movement of people at the end of the Lunar New Year holiday, would increase the spreading of disease. Facing this concern, government of China implemented policies which was helpful in control the disease such as, extended the holiday so the holiday would long enough to shelter the incubation period of COVID-19, isolation of confirmed cases in hospitals, quarantining mild or asymptomatic persons in different hospitals, home-based quarantine of people from Hubei province (epicenter of the epidemic), and the most important one was to prevent individuals with asymptomatic infections from spreading the virus.( [19] , [22] ) Iran is facing this concern as an important upcoming event in Iran is Nowruz which is the Iranian New Year, which recommended prompted policies from government.",
