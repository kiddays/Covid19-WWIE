Respondents were required to self-report demographic characteristics and respond to questions about COVID-19 and mitigation strategies including compliance, priorities, sources of concern, and comparisons of current lifestyle versus lifestyle between October and December 2019 (i.e., before COVID-19 and mitigation strategies). Additional health-related questions were asked independent of COVID-19. When possible, brief validated instruments were used, including the Short-Form Sleep Condition Indicator (SCI-01) for insomnia risk assessment, Patient Health Questionnaire-4 (PHQ-4) for anxiety and depression risk assessment, the Perceived Stress Scale-4 (PSS-4) for perceived stress assessment, and the Mini Z for burnout risk assessment. 5 ",

Overall, 3039 (54.5%) were female; the median age of participants was 47 years (range, 18-89). See Table 2 for respondent characteristics. Cross-sectional results of COVID-19-mitigation compliance, public priorities, and life impact for each sample are reported by region ( Figure 2 ; Table 1 ). Altogether, 4560 respondents (81.8%) reported quarantining or voluntarily self-isolating (range of samples, 75.5%-88.2%). Moreover, 5022 (90.1%) believe a government-imposed stay-at-home order is warranted (range of samples, 88.9%-93.1%). Of these, 90.8% believe the order should last at least three more weeks (9.1%), a month or longer (43.8%), or until public health (31.1%) or government officials (6.8%) determine it is safe to lift the restrictions. Of 5304 respondents (95.2%) who made predictions, the average predicted date by which COVID-19 would no longer affect their daily lives was between mid-June and mid-August, though there was high variability in predictions. Strong support for a government-imposed stay-at-home order spanned the political spectrum (Table 1) ",

We recognize the potential for self-selection bias; however, the high response rate (63.9%) and consistency of responses across cities and countries despite different rates of infection, governments, and mitigation strategies indicate that these results are robust. Contrary to public attitudes and compliance with recommended mitigation during the last pandemic [16] [17] declared by the World Health Organization for novel influenza A (H1N1) in 2009, 18 the public response to the COVID-19 pandemic represents a hitherto unprecedented and rapid level of compliance with public health emergency measures that have and will continue to have a profound impact on economics and public life. These results demonstrate an escalated public response compared to before shelter-in-place orders were widely implemented, 19 and contribute to a growing body of evidence that mitigation strategies for COVID-19, like those for previous outbreaks, are associated with significant disruption of life and general health consequences. 20-25 These findings may also provide insight into behavioral countermeasures related to sleep, exercise, and diet that may reduce adverse health consequences of COVID-19 mitigation measures.
