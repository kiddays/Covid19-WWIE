A customary response to a surge of a communicable disease is to separate healthcare systems into cohorts, such that patients with other conditions can be treated safely without risk of infection. A challenge with COVID-19 is the existence of currently asymptomatic infections, which without aggressive testing and isolation might enter the non-COVID-19 cohort either through unknowingly infected patients or health care workers. Using stochastic simulations we study the impacts of testing and personal protective equipment (PPE) use. In the base case without testing or PPE, healthcare is rapidly overwhelmed, and becomes a net contributor to the force of infection. We find that effective use of PPE by both HCW and patients can prevent this situation, while testing alone is less effective. We also find that even imperfectly effective use of PPE can provide substantial protection and decrease the force of infection. This illustrates the importance of maintaining supplies of PPE throughout healthcare systems.",

Not only is this a major concern for the health of people on the front line of pandemic response, there is also a risk of transmission to patients. For this reason, the design of cohorting strategies to restrict contact between COVID-19 patients and the rest of the healthcare system are of great importance. Already in some locations, hospitals or other facilities are being exclusively dedicated for COVID-19 patients, separate from others for the non-COVID-19 cohort, and alternate care facilities are in the process of being established [1] . China built entirely new healthcare facilities to handle the surge in Wuhan [3, 17] .",

The dynamics of health care workers and the uninfected patients are stochastic. Within the non-COVID-19 cohort, we assume that once individuals become symptomatic they are identified and removed.

We anticipate that HCWs to patients transmission rates will also be high. HCWs transmit to patients at a rate that is C HP times that of a general member of the public to other members of the public. It should be noted that patients typically outnumber HCWs. So the transmissions from patients to HCWs are concentrated in a smaller population.

While this leads to a high force of infection to patients in the early stage of the epidemic ( Figure  1 (a)), later, once many of the HCWs have developed immunity or become symptomatic and moved into quarantine, the force of infection to patients drops. At later stages, as the epidemic grows in the general population, the patients are at reduced risk.

As shown, an increasing proportion of asymptomatic infections impacts upon the FOI among the HCWs, making it peak earlier with concomitant effects on patients ( Figure  3(a-c) ). But the effect of this is minor in comparison with the consequences of reducing the duration of the asymptomatic period (Figure 3(d) ), which intuitively reduces the opportunity for exposure and transmission.

The potential for transmission from pre-symptomatic individuals has long been known to be a crucial component in how hard we expect it to be to control an infection [5] . This model shows that if we wish to prevent SARS-CoV-2 transmission among the vulnerable non-covid cohort it is helpful to assume that all individuals may be infectious, both staff and patients, and act accordingly.

We also do not directly model the consequences of transmission in the health care setting; obviously transmission to elderly patients or otherwise vulnerable individuals is expected to have an outsize impact on overall mortality and the strain on healthcare in general. We have also not considered the consequences of an overdistributed R0. The SARS-CoV-1 outbreak, as well as MERS outbreaks have both been characterised by superspreading events in healthcare settings [8, 22] , and future work should explicitly consider the impact of these. This is especially relevant to our findings on the size of individual subcohorts, because it is known that an overdispersed R0 can lead to situations in which most disease introductions go extinct, but those that do not go on to cause explosive outbreaks [12] . 11 All rights reserved.

When there is no testing and no PPE (a), all HCWs are infected quite early on. The calculation of FOI on HCWs terminates once all have been infected. At peak about 40% of the HCWs are infected (not in quarantine), and shortly thereafter about 20% of the HCWs are under quarantine. The plots show that both testing (b) and PPE (c-d) can reduce the force of infection (FOI). But PPE has more substantial impacts on delaying and reducing the HCWs infection peak and the FOI. Noticeably, even only HCWs have PPE on (c), the infection peak and FOI in both HCWs and patients are reduced. (e) is showing the impact of simutaneously having both testing and PPE. 6 All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission.",
