With repercussions ranging from rampant mortality, fear, paranoia and economic recession the virus has brought together countries in order to look at possible therapeutic countermeasures. With prophylactic interventions possibly months away from particularly being effective, a slew of measures and possibilities concerning design of vaccines are being worked upon. We attempt a structure based approach utilizing a combination of epitope prediction servers to develop a multi-epitope based subunit vaccine that involves the two major domains of the spike glycoprotein of SARS CoV-2 ( S1 and S2) coupled with a substantially effective chimeric adjuvant acting as a triagonist to substantially create stable vaccine constructs through MD simulations. The designed constructs are evaluated based on their docking with Toll Like Receptor (TLR) 4. Our findings provide epitope-based peptide fragment which can be potential candidates for development of vaccine against SARS-CoV-2.",

The interaction between the spike glycoprotein with the human ACE-2 receptor is important as it initiates the process of viral entry into human beings through contact with an infected individual. The identification of a probable site upstream of the receptor binding motif (which includes the residues on S1 that interacts with hACE-2) which undergoes cleavage and requires priming by TMPRSS2 before stable fusion of the viral membrane complex to the hACE2 [11] and involves sufficient non-reversible conformational changes that puts into motion the process of viral entry [1, 5] .",

Another approach that we took was modeling the two parts of the vaccine construct separately using single template but linking both of these through loops and energy minimizations of these constructs again fell through. The ROBETTA server [51] [52] [53] that allows for comparative modeling however brought the most promising model of the vaccine constructs with sufficient secondary structure coverage. Each of these constructs were then deposited over GALAXY webserver [54] for refinement. Based on select parameters based on which each modeled construct is refined, the best structures were then carried forward for validation through Ramachandran Plot, Z-score over PROCHECK [55] and ProSA-web server [56] .

These residues were not considered in the vaccine constructs and the aberrations are generally isolated to the S1 domain only. Regardless, a single residue mismatch spread over the vaccine will definitely not have a substantial effect on acting as an immunogen across clinical settings in different countries. Hence, sequence coverage based validation of the selected epitopes were also carried out. The list of epitopes considered for design of the vaccines did not include any sequences that did not conform to the 100% sequence coverage. The percent identity matrix utilized to indicate that the Indian sequence shows percent identity of more than 90% and the epitopes utilized show a 100% sequence coverage across the sequence submitted from India of the spike glycoproteins [38] (Figure 2 ).",

Moreover, basic or neutral isoelectric points also indicate a stable in vivo half-life for the modeled constructs. And since we cannot assess it entirely on these assumptions we investigated the stability of the constructs through a 100 nanoseconds Molecular Dynamics Simulation.

The prediction of the three different types of epitopes ( B cells, T HTL and T CTL ) by utilizing multiple different servers in each case based on different algorithms and selection based on a consensus involving all the servers including experimental basis behind alleles (HLA Class I and Class II) selected helps add sustenance to the concluded list of epitopes [73] [74] [75] [76] [77] . Each of the predicted epitopes were verified based on described parameters and were found to be antigenic, non-allergen, non-toxic and share high coverage across the spike glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2 sequences [38] . Based on the necessity of an immunostimulant, the role of an adjuvant becomes important and specifically a chimeric adjuvant comprising of TLR-4 agonists [78] [79] [80] [81] [82] [83] [84] was designed and validated to have overlapping B cell epitope regions through the IEDB server. The adjuvant sequences have been experimentally evidenced to generate neutralizing antibodies, cytokines and natural killer cells.
