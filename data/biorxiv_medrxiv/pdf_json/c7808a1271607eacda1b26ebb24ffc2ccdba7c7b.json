Here we use state-of-the-art deep neural networks over an institution-wide machine intelligence platform for the augmented curation of 8.2 million clinical notes from 14,967 patients subjected to COVID-19 PCR diagnostic testing. By contrasting the Electronic Health Record (EHR)-derived clinical phenotypes of COVID-19-positive (COVIDpos, n=272) versus COVID-19-negative (COVIDneg, n=14,695) patients over each day of the week preceding the PCR testing date, we identify diarrhea (2.8-fold), change in appetite (2-fold), anosmia/dysgeusia (28.6-fold), and respiratory failure (2.1-fold) as significantly amplified in COVIDpos over COVIDneg patients. The specific combination of cough and diarrhea has a 4-fold amplification in COVIDpos patients during the week prior to PCR testing, and along with anosmia/dysgeusia, constitutes the earliest EHR-derived signature of COVID-19 (4-7 days prior to typical PCR testing date). This study introduces an Augmented Intelligence platform for the real-time synthesis of institutional knowledge captured in EHRs. The platform holds tremendous potential for scaling up curation throughput, with minimal need for training underlying neural networks, thus promising EHRpowered early diagnosis for a broad spectrum of diseases.",

The platform utilizes state-of-the-art transformer neural networks on the unstructured clinical notes to automate entity recognition (e.g. diseases, drugs, phenotypes), quantify the strength of contextual associations between entities, and characterize the nature of association into positive, negative, or other sentiments. We identify specific gastro-intestinal, respiratory, and sensory phenotypes, as well as some of their specific combinations, that appear to be indicative of impending COVIDpos diagnosis by PCR testing. This highlights the potential for neural networks-powered EHR curation to facilitate a significantly earlier diagnosis of COVID-19 than currently thought feasible.",

In order to investigate the time course of COVID-19 progression in patients, we used BERT-based deep neural networks to extract symptoms and their putative synonyms from the clinical notes for a few weeks prior to, and a few weeks post, the date when the COVID-19 diagnosis test was taken (see Methods; Table 1 ). For the purpose of this analysis, all patients were temporally aligned, by setting the date of COVID-19 PCR testing to 'day 0', and the proportion of patients demonstrating each symptom derived from the EHR over each day of the week preceding and post PCR testing was tabulated ( Table 2) . As a negative control, we included a non-COVID-19 symptom 'dysuria'.",

The combination of cough and diarrhea is noted to be particularly significant in COVIDpos over COVIDneg patients during the week preceding PCR testing; i.e. cough and diarrhea co-occur in 36 of 272 COVIDpos patients (13.2%) and in 486 of 14,695 COVIDneg patients (3.3%) indicating a 4-fold amplification of this specific symptom combination as a signature of impending COVID-19 diagnosis (BH corrected p-value = 9.3E-19).

Cough and diarrhea were found to be the early indicators that significantly discriminate COVIDpos from COVIDneg patients. In particular, between 3 to 7 days prior to PCR testing, cough is amplified in the COVIDpos patient cohort over the COVIDneg patient cohort with an amplification of 5.5-fold (day -7, p-value = 7.0E-16), 5.3-fold (day -6, p-value = 5.4E-15), 4.7-fold (day -5, p-value = 1.4E-10), 3.9-fold (day -4, p-value = 3.6E-08), and 3.8-fold (day -3, p-value = 7.3E-08). The intriguing diminishing odds of cough as a symptom from 7 to 3 days preceding the PCR testing date, suggests this may be a notable temporal pattern. Likewise, diarrhea is amplified in the COVIDpos patient cohort over the COVIDneg patient cohort with an amplification of 5.7-fold (day -7, p-value = 6.1E-11), 5-fold (day -6, p-value = 5.5E-08), 3.2-fold (day -5, p-value = 3E-03), and 4.2-fold (day -4, p-value = 7E-06). Following the enriched odds of diarrhea and cough, we further find that change in appetite may be considered a subsequent symptom of impending COVID-19 diagnosis. This is because, change in appetite is amplified in the COVIDpos cohort over the COVIDneg cohort on day -4 (3.4-fold, p-value = 4.4E-03), day -3 (3.7-fold, p-value = 2.9E-03), and day -2 (4.2-fold, p-value = 6.5E-05). Finally, as the day of PCR testing ensues, fever/chills are enriched in the COVIDpos over the COVIDneg cohort, with 1.6-fold (day 0, p-value = ), 2.4-fold (day 1, p-value = ) and 2fold (day 2, p-value = 1.7E-04) respectively. Similarly, cough is also amplified in the COVIDpos over the COVIDneg cohort on day 0 (1.9-fold, p-value = 2.1E-06), day 1 (2.8-fold, p-value = 2.3E-12) and day 2 (2fold, p-value = 2.8E-03) post the PCR testing date.

Given recent studies implicating the necessity of both ACE2 and TMPRSS2 for the SARS-CoV-2 lifecycle 10 , we scouted for human cells that co-express both genes. This co-expression analysis revealed that specific cell types from the small intestine/colon, nasal cavity, respiratory system, pancreas, urinary tract, and gallbladder co-express both ACE2 and TMPRSS2 ( Figure  1, Figure S1 ). Notably, multiple small intestine cell types co-express the two genes. These cell types include enterocytes, enteroendocrine cells, stem cells, goblet cells, and Paneth cells. In the pancreas, the cell types included ductal cells and acinar cells. The kidney cells co-expressing TMPRSS2 and ACE2 include proximal tubular cells, pelvic epithelial cells and type A intercalated cells. Co-expression of TMPRSS2 and ACE2 is also observed in the epithelial cells of the olfactory nasal cavity and the respiratory tract as well as in type II pneumocytes (albeit at comparatively lower level). While the identified tissues showing co-expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 in the gastro-intestinal, respiratory, and sensory systems correlate with the clinical phenotypes of early COVID-19 infection as described above, these insights are conceivably from normal/healthy tissues. This highlight the need for meticulous bio-banking of COVID-19 patient-derived biospecimen and their characterization via single cell RNA-seq and other molecular technologies.",

Some of the earliest phases of intervention attempt to inhibit the entry/replication of SARS-CoV-2 by modulating critical host targets (e.g. renin angiotensin aldosterone system/RAAS inhibitors, ACE2 analogs, serine protease inhibitors) or directly inhibiting the function of viral proteins (e.g. viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase inhibitors, protease inhibitors, convalescent plasma, synthetic immunoglobulins) (Box 1, Table  S2 ). In patients with more advanced stages of disease progression, who suffer from respiratory abnormalities, therapeutics are being advanced to target the inflammatory response that can lead to Acute Respiratory Disease Syndrome (ARDS) and is associated with high mortality (Box 1). These include anti-GM-CSF agents, anti-IL-6 agents, JAK inhibitors, and complement inhibitors. Another emerging option for patients at this stage is convalescent plasma, which has shown some clinical benefits in cases of COVID-19 and related viral diseases (SARS-1, MERS) at various stages of severity (Box 1). Administration of convalescent plasma containing active specific antiviral antibodies may prevent or attenuate progression to severe disease. Expanded access to convalescent plasma for treatment of patients with COVID-19 has been approved by the FDA for emergency IND use and is available through a nationwide program led by Mayo Clinic (Box 1).",

Meanwhile, patients are recommended to selfquarantine at home, use mask protection when social distancing cannot be obtained, and continue supportive measures. For patients with mild symptoms, such measures may be sufficient given the selflimited nature of viral syndromes. In the event of symptom exacerbation, often marked by worsening respiratory distress, medical evaluation is warranted, and possible hospitalization. The mainstay of treatment for COVID-19, remains supportive care, and as needed supplemental oxygen. Experimental therapies intended to block SARS-CoV2 viral entry and inhibit steps in the viral life cycle necessary for viral replication have been proposed at this early stage (Figure 2) . The goal of these therapies is to reduce viral load, thus reducing the chance of overwhelming immune reaction by delaying progression of the disease.",

A major manifestation of respiratory decompensation and cytokine release syndrome is acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Critical care support such as mechanical support from noninvasive to invasive mechanical ventilation and in, some instances, extracorporeal support, vasopressors, renal replacement therapy, anticoagulation, and are paramount to survival of these critically ill patients per SCC guidelines (SCCM/ESICM 2020).

This requires leveraging a privacy-preserving federated software architecture that enables each medical center to retain the span of control of their de-identified EHR databases, while enabling the machine learning models from partners to be deployed in their secure cloud infrastructure. Such seamless multi-institute collaborations over an Augmented Intelligence platform that puts patient privacy and HIPAA-compliance first, is being advanced actively over the Mayo Clinic's Clinical Data Analytics Platform Initiative (CDAP).

We went through individual sentences and either accepted the sentences or rejected and reclassified them. The neural networks were actively re-trained as curation progressed, leading to stepwise increases in curation efficiency and model accuracy. In step 1 of this process, we labeled 11433 sentences, 8737 of which were labeled as either 'present' or 'not present.' The model trained on this data set (80%-20% training/test split) achieved F1 scores of 0.93 and 0.84 for 'present' and 'not present' classifications, respectively. The model was then applied to an additional 3688 sentences in step 2, rapidly corrected by a human for classification errors and re-trained to generate a newer version of the model. Step 3 was an iteration of step 2 on an additional 3369 sentences. The model achieved F1 scores of 0.96/0.91 after step 2 and 0.96/0.96 after step 3 for the classification of 'present'/'not present.'
