The predicted death toll is almost 14000 casualties, with 2.4 million infected individuals at the end of the epidemic.

Bernoulli (1760) used a mathematical method to evaluate the effectiveness of the techniques of variolation against smallpox, with the aim of influencing public health policy. Most of the models are compartmental models, with the population divided into classes and assumptions about the time rate of transfer from one class to another (Hethcote, 2000; Brauer, 2017) . We consider a Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Removed (SEIR) model to describe the spread of the virus and compute the number of infected and dead individuals. The SEIR model has many versions and the mathematical treatment can be found, for instance, in Hethcote (2000) , Keeling and Rohani (2008) and Diekmann et al. (2013) among others. The goal is to compute the number of infected, recovered and dead individuals on the basis of the number of contacts, probability of the disease transmission, incubation period, recovery rate and fatality rate. The epidemic disease model predicts a peak of infected and dead individuals per day as a function of time, and assumes that births and natural deaths are balanced, since we are dealing with a very short period of time. The population members solely decrease due to the disease dictated by the fatality rate of the disease.",

These quantities describe a model with vital dynamics (endemic model), which have an inflow of births into the S class at rate \u039b and deaths into the other classes at rates \u00b5S, \u00b5I and \u00b5R (see Figure 1 ). If \u039b = \u00b5N , the deaths balance the newborns and N is constant (but including casualties). The number of live people at time t is N (t) = S(t) + E(t) + I(t) + R(t), that can be lower or higher than N 0 depending on the value of \u039b and \u00b5. In this case, it is lower than N 0 .",

On the other hand, Figure 4b shows that for R 0 < 1, the peak location does not change but its intensity does it significantly, with more exposed, more infected. In order the epidemic to start, there should be at least one exposed or one infected individual. Figure 5 indicates that the incubation period (1/ ) has also an impact on the results. If R 0 > 1 (5a), increasing the period from 3 to 9 days decreases the maximum number of infected individuals by almost half and delays the spread of the epidemic, but the peak is wider. If R 0 < 1, the curves behave similarly, but there are much less infected cases.",

We use the total number of deaths for the calibration. Table 1 shows the constraints, initial values and results for different cases, where Cases 1 and 2 correspond to approximately nine times less exposed individuals at the beginning of the epidemic, and Cases 2 and 3 assume double casualties. Cases 4 and 5 consider a wider range of the lower and upper bounds for the incubation and infection periods ( \u22121 and \u03b3 \u22121 ). The last column is not a variable but indicates the infected individuals at the end of the epidemic, i.e., I\u221e = R\u221e + D\u221e \u2248 R\u221e. Figure 10 shows the curves of Case 1 compared to the data (black dots), with IFR = 0.57 % and R 0 decreasing from 3 to 0.64 at the end of the epidemic. The final infected individuals are 2.37 million people (see Figure 11 and Table 1 ). The inflection point at day 22 (Figure 10b) indicates that the isolation measures started to be effective. Strict isolation could not be achieved at day 22 due to several reasons and there is a reasonable delay of a few days before it can be implemented (day 35). The total number of casualties is approximately 14000 and the effective duration of the epidemic is about 90 days. Recent data reveal that the duration of the Wuhan epidemic was almost 60 days (Wu et al., 2020, Fig . 1b) , a shorter period favoured by the very strict isolation measures applied in that city. Case 2, that considers twice more casualties, and whose results are shown in Figures 12 and   13 , has a high fatality rate, IFR = 2.36 %, and 1.14 million infected people. If the exposed individuals are much higher (Case 3), we obtain IFR = 0.47 % and 5.9 million infected people (see Figures 14 and 15 and Table 1 ). The calculations indicate the uncertainty related to the initially exposed individuals, i.e., those that are incubating the disease.",

Therefore, it is essential to absolutely avoid it by taking the necessary measures at the right time, something that has not been accomplished in Italy and the rest of the world. According to these calculations, the effective measures are social distancing and home isolation, since there is no health system designed for ordinary circumstances that can be prepared for a pandemic, when the infected individuals grows almost exponentially. As can be seen, the pandemic can develop in a few days and the number of casualties can be extremely high if the fatality rate and contagiousness of the disease are high. Only a few days to take action can make a big difference in the prevention of this disaster. The pandemic and its consequences have been predicted in October 2019 by a group of experts (https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2020/03/07/ coronavirus-epidemic-prediction-policy-advice-121172), but states ignored the fact and transnational nature of the threat, delaying the necessary measures to avoid the disaster, minimizing in many cases the downsides to their own populations and economies.

We have also doubled the number of casualties and obtained IFR = 2.36 % and 0.47 %, with the second value corresponding to nine times more exposed individuals. These values are obtained by constraining the incubation and infection periods to values reported in the literature. If we relax these constraints and use a wider range of lower and upper bounds, we obtain slightly higher incubation and infection periods compared to the first case, but a much higher IFR (2.25 % versus 0.57 %), while much more exposed individuals yields an incubation period of 13 days and a lower IFR (0.6 %). Therefore, a precise determination of the fatality rate is subject to the knowledge of the parameters of the epidemic and characteristics of the disease, and it is clear from these calculations that the usefulness of simple models to predict is limited, and that their main role is to help in our understanding of the dynamics of the epidemic.

Quarantine was even implemented in medieval times to fight the black death before knowing the existence of viruses. In this sense, this pandemic reveals the failure of policy makers, since it is well known from basic modeling results that anticipating those measures can save thousand of lives and even prevent the pandemic. The interface of science, society and politics is still uneasy, even in highly developed countries, revealing a disregard for scientific evidence.

To our knowledge, this is the first time that this model is calibrated with the number of casualties. The simulation attempts to provide a simple procedure to model the coronavirus diffusion in a given region. The example regards the epidemic in the Lombardy province (Italy) which is taking place at the time of this writing, but can be applied in general. We show how the date of the peak and the number of casualties are affected by the effectiveness of the home isolation, incubation and infection periods, probability of transmission and initially exposed individuals. The results from the procedure, that intends to be the basis for a real case study, where it is clear the effect of each parameter and variable in the dynamic evolution of the epidemic.",
