Recently, several outbreaks of zoonotic viral pathogens have been reconstructed using genomic information [4] [5] [6] [7] . Equally, WGS can be used to inform outbreak control decisions. Evidence of this was seen during the 2014-2016 West African Ebola outbreak when real-time WGS was used to help public health decision making, a strategy for which the term \"precision public health pathogen genomics\" has been dubbed 8,9 . In this definition, the use of WGS can provide a more detailed picture of the sources of infection and transmission chains. Immediate sharing and combining data during outbreaks is now recommended as an integral part of outbreak response [10] [11] [12] . Feasibility of real-time WGS relies on the access to sequence platforms that provide reliable sequences, access to metadata for interpretation, and data analysis at high speed and low cost. Therefore, whole genome sequencing for outbreak support is an active area of research. Nanopore sequencing has been employed in recent outbreaks of Usutu, Ebola, Zika and Yellow fever virus owing to the ease of use and relatively low start-up cost [4] [5] [6] [7] . The robustness of this method has recently been validated using Usutu virus 13, 14 .",

Upon notification, the PHS initiates source identification and contact tracing, and performs risk assessments. In the early outbreak phase (containment), the PHS traced and informed all high and low risk contacts of cases with the aim to stop further transmission. For each case, epidemiological information such as demographic information, symptoms, date of onset of symptoms, travel history, contact information, suspected source, underlying disease, and occupation were registered. Due to the magnitude of the COVID-19 outbreak this quickly became impracticable in severely affected regions, and the strategy shifted to registering data on confirmed cases only and informing their high-risk contacts (phase 2) with continued active case finding in less affected regions.

This diversification provided the basis for the use of WGS to investigate possible transmission chains locally, for instance in healthcare settings, where it can be used to inform infection control and prevention when combined with background data on contact histories among others. Moreover, the continued effort will lay the foundation for the enhanced surveillance that will be paramount during the next phase of the pandemic, when confinement measures will gradually be lifted. Given the widespread circulation, most likely scenario is that SARS-CoV-2 will (sporadically) re-emerge, and discrimination between novel introductions versus prolonged local circulation is important to inform appropriate public health decision. In addition, due to genomic mutations, the phenotype and the transmission dynamics of the virus might change during time.
