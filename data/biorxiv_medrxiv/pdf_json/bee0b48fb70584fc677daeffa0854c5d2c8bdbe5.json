            "text": "With the global coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic, there is an urgent need for risk stratification tools to support prevention and treatment decisions. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) listed several criteria that define high-risk individuals, but multivariable prediction models may allow for a more accurate and granular risk evaluation. In the early days of the pandemic, when individual level data required for training prediction models was not available, a large healthcare organization developed a prediction model for supporting its COVID-19 policy using a hybrid strategy. The model was constructed on a baseline predictor to rank patients according to their risk for severe respiratory infection or sepsis (trained using over one-million patient records) and was then post-processed to calibrate the predictions to reported COVID-19 case fatality rates. Since its deployment in mid-March, this predictor was integrated into many decision-processes in the organization that involved allocating limited resources. With the accumulation of enough COVID-19 patients, the predictor was validated for its accuracy in predicting COVID-19 mortality among all COVID-19 cases in the organization (3,176, 3.1% death rate). The predictor was found to have good discrimination, with an area under the receiver-operating characteristics curve of 0.942. Calibration was also good, with a marked improvement compared to the calibration of the baseline model when evaluated for the COVID-19 mortality outcome. While the CDC criteria identify 41% of the population as high-risk with a resulting sensitivity of 97%, a 5% absolute risk cutoff by the model tags only 14% to be at high-risk while still achieving a sensitivity of 90%. To summarize, we found that even in the midst of a pandemic, shrouded in epidemiologic \"fog of war\" and with no individual level data, it was possible to provide a useful predictor with good discrimination and calibration.",

Training of these models requires individual level data, which is usually available from retrospective electronic healthcare record (EHR) data 6, 7 or from datasets of cohorts that were collected for research purposes 8, 9 .

CHS, the largest of these organizations, insures over half of the Israeli population (approximately 4.5 million members), which are a representative sample of the entire population. The CHS data warehouse contains both medical data (primary care, specialist care, laboratory data, in-network hospitalization data, imaging data etc.) and claims data (mostly out-of-network hospitalization data).

The algorithm iterates until no subgroups remain whose average is further from their target value by more than a pre-determined tolerance, which was set to 1%. Since the subpopulations are overlapping, this process requires several iterations until it converges (A detailed pseudocode of this algorithm is provided in Supplementary Figure 1 ).

The importance of the correction is further illustrated by decision curves (Figure 4b (. These curves, which compare the utility of the decisions that would have been made using the two models, show that decisions made using the COVID-19 predictions are superior to those made by the baseline model for the thresholds relevant for defining high-risk groups.",

This work presents a model for prediction of COVID-19 mortality that was developed using a hybrid approach, by calibrating the predictions from a baseline model -designed to rank the population according to the risk for severe respiratory infections or sepsis -to reported COVID-19 mortality rates. The resulting model, developed rapidly under conditions of uncertainty, entered wide use in CHS around mid-March, just before the first case of COVID-19 fatality in Israel. Since then, with the increase in the number of COVID-19 patients in Israel, some with severe outcomes, it became possible to validate its performance.",

For that purpose, two cutoffs of high risk groups were defined: the very-high risk group (absolute predicted risk \u2265 10%, about 4.3% of the CHS population over the age of 10 years) and the high risk group (absolute predicted risk of 5-10%; 6.7% of the population).

If it is decided that the patient can be treated outside of a hospital, the physician checks the patient's risk group. Patients of the very-high risk group are reconsidered for hospital admission.

This was eventually not done because of issues that were raised about the quality of the published comorbidity data in the Chinese report.

A smoothed line is fit to each curve. The \"rug\" above and under the plots illustrates the distribution of predictions for each model. B. The decision curve plots the standardized net benefit against different decision thresholds for both models. Net benefit is a measure of utility that calculates a weighted sum of true positives and false positives, weighted according to the threshold. Vertical dashed lines were added at relevant decision thresholds that were used in practice. Abbreviations: COVID-19, Corona Virus Disease 2019 .

Among this population of 1,050,000 Clalit Health Services' (CHS) members over the age of 10 years, 11,718 (1.1%) positive outcomes were recorded over a follow-up period of one year. The contribution and effect of the features of the baseline model for prediction of its chosen outcome, as measured by SHAP scores, are presented in Figure 1. Panel A of the figure presents the overall importance and effect of all variables in the model. Panel B presents the odds ratios across different values of three selected variables 15 .",
