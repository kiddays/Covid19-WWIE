To examine the transmission dynamics of COVID-6 19 and its interactions with some exogenous factors such as limited medical resources and false detection problems, we 7 employ a simple epidemiological model and analyse this system using modelling and dynamical systems techniques. We 8 discover some contrasting findings with respect to the observations of basic reproduction number, and we investigate how 9 the issues of limited medical resources and false detection problems affect the COVID-19 pandemic outbreak. 10",
