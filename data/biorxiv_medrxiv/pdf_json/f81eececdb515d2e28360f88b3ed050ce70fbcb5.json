In addition, it has been estimated that 18% [6] to 50% [7, 8] of people infected with COVID-19 do not show symptoms. Even in symptomatic infections, under-reporting can further complicate the accurate characterization of the COVID-19 burden. For example, one study estimated that in China, 86% of cases had not been captured by lab-confirmed tests [9] , and it is possible that this percentage is even higher in the US [5] . Finally, it has been suggested that the available information on confirmed COVID-19 cases across geographies may be an indicator of the local testing capacity over time (as opposed to an indicator of the epidemic trajectory). Thus, solely relying on positive test counts to infer the total number of COVID-19 infections, and the epidemic trajectory, may not be sensible [10] .",

One such approach is to analyze region-specific changes in the number of individuals seeking medical attention with influenza-like illness (ILI), defined as having a fever in addition to a cough or sore throat. The significant overlap in symptoms common to both ILI and COVID-19 suggests that leveraging existing disease monitoring systems, such as ILINet, a sentinel system created and maintained by the United States Centers of Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) [11, 12] , may offer a way to estimate the prevalence of COVID-19 without needing to rely on COVID-19 testing results. Importantly, recent regional increases in ILI in conjunction with stable or decreasing influenza case numbers present a discrepancy (or an increase in ILI not explained by an increase in influenza) that can be used to impute COVID-19 cases.",

A third and final approach, which uses reported COVID-19-attributed deaths to estimate COVID-19 prevalence and improves upon previously introduced methodologies [13, 14, 15, 16] is presented.

We believe that this provides a more balanced picture of the uncertainty over COVID-19 prevalence in each state. While our results are approximations and depend on a variety of (likely time-dependent) estimated factors, we believe that our presented case counts better represent prevalence than simply relying on laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 tests. Providing such estimates for each state enables the design and implementation of more effective and efficient public health measures to mitigate the effects of the ongoing COVID-19 epidemic outbreak. While the scope of this paper is focused on the United States, the methods introduced here are general enough that they may prove useful to estimate COVID-19 burden in other locations with comparable disease (and death) monitoring systems.",

These dates correspond to the early stages of the outbreak (with fewer than 50 confirmed cases in the US), up to the date of the most recent available CDC reports as of April 16th. The first two methods, labeled div-IDEA and div-Vir, fall under the Divergence approach, which first estimates what the level of ILI activity across the US would have been if the COVID-19 outbreak had not occurred. Each method develops a control time series and uses the unexpected increase in ILI rate over the control to infer the burden of COVID-19. div-IDEA is based on an epidemiological model, the IDEA model [19] , fitted to the observed 2019-2020 ILI (prior to the introduction of COVID-19 to the US), while div-Vir is based on the time-evolution of empirical observations of positive virological influenza test statistics. The third method, based on the COVID Scaling approach, leverages healthcare ILI visits and COVID-19 test statistics to directly infer the proportion of ILI due to COVID-19 in the full population. The fourth method, based on the mortality MAP (mMAP ) approach, uses the time series of COVID-19-attributed deaths in combination with the observed epidemiological characteristics of COVID-19 in hospitalized individuals, to infer the latent disease onset time series, which is then scaled up to estimate case counts using the expected infection fatality ratio (IFR).

The adjusted mMAP method supplements the confirmed COVID-19 deaths with unusual increases in pneumonia-related deaths across the country that may represent untested COVID-19 cases.

In contrast, our methods frequently estimate 10-fold to 100-fold more cases than those reported and show significant state-level variability. The median estimate for the ratio of actual cases to reported cases for the adjusted div-IDEA method is 23 (with a 90% interval from 6 to 114), for adjusted div-Vir is 25 (5, 88), for adjusted COVID-Scaling is 14 (3, 62) , and for adjusted mMAP is 9 (4, 14) .

Even places with high official case counts, such as Georgia, Pennsylvania, and Texas, appear to be significantly under-reporting.

Furthermore, they show strong rank correlations (larger than 0.65 across states and methods) with the reported case counts. mMAP has an especially high 0.96 correlation with the reported case counts, which is likely because official COVID-19 deaths and positive COVID-19 cases represent the same pool of patients and are therefore subject to the same bias. The other methods, however, rely on aggregate data from ILINet, which may cover a different set of patients. While the rank-correlation across methods is high, mMAP generally yields lower estimates than the others (Fig. 2 ). One possible explanation is that many deaths caused by COVID-19 are not being officially counted as COVID-19 deaths because of a lack of testing (and that accounting for increased pneumonia deaths does not fully capture this) [24] ; further evidence of this reasoning is that New York City started reporting plausible COVID-19 deaths (as in, not needing a test result) [25] , and mMAP 's estimates are closer (and actually higher) than the other methods' estimates there.",

Assuming our (national) multiplicative factors to be good approximations for what took place from April 4th to April 16th, the current cumulative number of COVID-19 cases nationally could be anywhere from 6 to 16 million (9-fold to 25-fold higher than confirmed cases).",

Considering an empirical (and likely naive) doubling time of a week, this means the prevalence of COVID-19, at any point in time (and stage of infection), could be 2-4 times higher than the estimates presented here. Taking this lag into consideration would suggest that it is plausible that up to 32 million cases individuals may be infected as of April 16th (50-fold higher than confirmed cases).",

Accurate and appropriately-sampled serological testing would provide the most accurate estimate of prevalence and would be useful for public health measures, especially when attempting to relax current shelter-in-place recommendations.

This could inform prevalence estimation methods for COVID-19 in other countries as well as for future pandemics. The ILI-based methods presented in this study demonstrate the potential of existing and well-established ILI surveillance systems to monitor future pandemics that, like COVID-19, present similar symptoms to ILI. This is especially promising given the WHO initiative launched in 2019 to expand influenza surveillance globally [33] .

The Divergence methods suffer from the same challenges faced when attempting to scale CDC-measured ILI activity to the entire population [40] . In particular, scaling to case counts in a population requires estimates for p(visit), the probability that a person seeks medical attention for any reason, and p(visit | ILI) which captures health care seeking behavior given that a person is experiencing ILI; these estimates are likely to change over time, especially during the course of a pandemic. Moreover, the weekly prevalence estimates from this method decrease towards the end of March, perhaps caused by a change in health care seeking behavior after the declaration of a national emergency on March 13, 2020 and the widespread implementation of shelter-in-place mitigation strategies. COVID Scaling relies on the assumption that COVID-19 positive test proportions uniformly represent the pool of all ILI patients and that shortages in testing do not bias the positive proportion upward or downward. Finally, mMAP is limited by assumptions of the Infection Fatality Rate, the distribution of time from case onset to death, and accurate reporting of COVID-19 deaths (or in the case of adjusted mMAP, that excess pneumonia deaths capture all unreported COVID-19 deaths). A high-level summary of the three methods, their estimation strategy, and their assumptions are provided in Table 2 .",

Inevitably, as social distancing measures are relaxed, there will be a resurgence in cases.

In such a scenario, the US population may be closer to herd immunity than previously anticipated, and we may expect that subsequent waves of infection will eventually decrease in magnitude, until COVID-19 becomes a relatively controllable seasonal affliction like influenza [41] .",

In other words, we use the IDEA model ILI estimates as the counterfactual when assessing the impact of the COVID-19 intervention.

COVID's impact on ILI activity is measured using as controls an Incidence Decay with Exponential Adjustment model as well as influenza testing statistics. Extrapolate state-level positive test percentages for COVID-19 to the weekly ILI data to estimate COVID-19 proportion in medical visits, then scale to the whole population. Using reported COVID-19 deaths, the IFR, and a distribution of time from cases to deaths, predict the latent case distribution. Model Assumptions 1. The divergence between predicted ILI activity for the 2019-2020 season and measured ILI activity after the start of the COVID-19 pandemic can be attributed to COVID-19. 2. Scaling from ILI to population is reliable. 1. COVID-19 test reports accurately represent the pool of weekly ILI visits.",
