Since January 21, WHO reports daily data on confirmed cases and deaths from both China and other countries [1]. The Johns Hopkins University [5] collects those data from various sources worldwide on a daily basis. For Germany, the Robert-Koch-Institute (RKI) also issues daily reports on the current number of infections and infection related fatal cases [2]. However, due to delays in the data collection, the data from RKI always lags behind those reported by Johns Hopkins. In this work we present an extended SEIR-model to describe the disease dynamics in Germany. The parameter values are identified by matching the model output to the officially reported cases. An additional parameter to capture the influence of unidentified cases is also included in the model.",

In the meantime, these cases have been identified as infections with a novel strain of coronavirus, called SARS-CoV-2. Its genome sequence turned out to be 75-to 80-percent identical to the SARS-coronavirus, that caused a major outbreak in Asia in 2003. At the beginning of January 2020, the virus spread over mainland China and reached other provinces. Increased travel activities due to the Chinese new year festivities supported the expansion of the infection. From January 21 onwards, WHO's daily situation reports contain the latest figures on confirmed cases and deaths, see [1] . The first COVID-19 case in Germany was reported in late January 2020 in a company close to Munich, Bavaria. Later cases were imported by travelers from China, Iran or Italy as well as tourists returning from ski holidays in the Austria and Italy. By 1 March 2020 more than 100 cases were reported in Germany and since than the number of cases began to rise exponentially. The first deaths were reported on 9 March 2020 [2, 6] .",

The susceptibles constitute the reservoir of persons that are not yet infected with SARS-CoV-2. After infection susceptible become exposed meaning that they already carry the virus but are not yet infectious. With a rate \u03d1 exposed individuals become infectious and transmit the virus with rate \u03b2 to susceptibles. An infected individual loses infectivity with \u03b3 and has a probability \u00b5 of dying due to the disease [8] . Figure 2 shows the transmission structure.

In order to validate our models and to identify the parameters involved therein, both the registered number of infections and the registered number of COVID-19 related deaths are important indications. The number of registered deaths is probably considerably more reliable, since the number of registered infections depends on the number of tests conducted and the dark figure of undetected, mostly asymptomatic cases, is assumed to be remarkably large [9] . We will discuss this point later in more detail. In the previous basic or timedependent SEIRD-model, the actual increase of the disease related deaths dD dt is assumed to be proportional to the current number of infected persons. The Robert-Koch-Institute specifies an average of 10 days between the onset of symptoms and admission to the intensive care unit [3] . Therefore, we assume \u03c4 = 14 for the time between the onset of infectiousness and death. In order to include this time lag into our model, we introduce a delay-term into the 5 .

The only data available for parameter identification are the total number of registered cases C = I + R + D and the deaths D. The total registered cases heavily depend on the number of tests conducted. If a person is infected, but not tested, this person will not appear in the official statistics. Hence, there is a presumably large dark figure in the officially recorded data. Our model parameter \u03b4 takes this into account. The other, may be more reliable, available data are the recorded deaths. Here we may assume that all COVID-19 related deaths are diagnosed and hence there is no dark figure in the D-compartment. However, one scenario could be possible. A large dark figure in the entire cases, i.e. a small detection rate \u03b4 and a very small lethality could result in the same or at least similar observed data as a moderate or even small dark figure and hence large detection rate \u03b4 combined with a higher lethality rate. In that setting a simultaneous identification of both, the detection rate \u03b4 and the lethality \u00b5 could be difficult due to their counteracting effects.",

Besides a standard SEIR-model, we consider an extension taking into account the effect of social distancing by a time-dependent reduction of the transmission rate. The third model introduces a delay-term to accurately describe the deaths depending on infected cases that occurred several days in the past. Comparing the simulation results to the data published by Johns Hopkins University allows an estimation of the unknown model parameters. Best results are obtained using the delay equation model. In this setting, we find a detection rate of about 20% and a lethality of about 4%. The social distancing measures were leading to an effective reduction of the transmission rate by a factor 4. That is, after the introduction of the measures roughly just 25% of the social contact compared to the initial period were leading to infections.",
