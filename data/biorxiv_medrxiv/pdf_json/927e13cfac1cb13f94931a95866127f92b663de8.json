While ivermectin concentrations in lung tissue cannot be measured in humans, ivermectin lung exposure was reported to be 2.7x higher than total plasma exposure in cattle after a single dose (4).

It is noted that these results did not account for co-morbidities that might account for these differences. Nevertheless, if ivermectin did contribute to these clinical findings, it would suggest that the in vitro findings by Caly, Druce (1) do not correlate with the very small amounts of the drug at the site of action in humans, concentrations of drug do not need to reach the IC50 for clinical benefit, distribution into the lungs of humans is greater than in cattle, or that accumulation in lung tissue is much greater (>25-fold) than expected after repeat dosing.",

Of key importance is determining whether ivermectin has general properties that would allow inhalation, with no local tolerability issues. Experts must, therefore, evaluate whether ivermectin possesses the ideal properties for inhalation, and whether inhalation of ivermectin poses any theoretical risks that might limit this route of administration.",
