We show that all three viruses 101 perform extensive recombination during replication in vitro, with broadly similar patterns 102 of recombination, generating diverse populations of recombined molecules. We further 103 demonstrate that genetically engineered inactivation of MHV nsp14-ExoN activity 104 results in a significant decrease in recombination frequency, altered recombination 105 junction patterns across the genome, and altered junction site selection. These defects 106 and alterations result in a marked change in MHV-ExoN(-) recombined RNA 107 populations, including defective viral genomes (DVGs). Previous studies our lab and 108 others confirm the requirement of ExoN activity in high-fidelity replication, exclusion of 109 aberrant nucleotides, viral fitness, and virulence (Eckerle et al., 2007, 2007; Ferron et 110 al., 2018a; Graham et al., 2012). Combined with the multiple critical integrated functions 111 recombination junctions as well as description of the genetic architectures of molecules 139 formed by the junctions. 140 141 For RNA-seq, we generated libraries in triplicate from 2 \u00b5g samples of both MERS-CoV 142 and SARS-CoV-2 infected cells. Reads were aligned to the respective viral genomes 143 using a recombination-aware mapper, ViReMa (Virus Recombination Mapper) (Routh 144 and Johnson, 2014). ViReMa detects non-homologous recombination events resulting 145 in subgenomic mRNAs (sgmRNAs) and defective viral genomes (DVGs) by identifying 146 recombination junctions that generate a deletion greater than 5 base-pairs flanked on 147 both sides by a 25 base-pair alignment. ViReMa aligned both recombined and non-148 recombined reads in the library and reported the total number of nucleotides aligned to 149 the genome and all detected recombination junctions (Figure S1A-B). 150 151 MERS-CoV RNA contained an average of 19,367 detected junctions per dataset and 152 SARS-CoV-2 libraries had an average of 56,082 detected junctions per dataset. To 153 normalize for variations in library size between samples, recombination junction 154 frequency (Jfreq) was calculated for MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 (Figure 1B). Jfreq 155 refers to the number of nucleotides in all detected junctions normalized to total mapped 156 nucleotides in a library. MERS-CoV had a mean Jfreq of 37.80 junctions detected per SARS-CoV-2 displayed clusters of junctions between the 5' and 3' ends of the genome, 162 intermediate genomic positions and the 3' end of the genome, and within the 3' end of 163 the genome (Figure 1B-C). SARS-CoV-2 also had many low-frequency junctions 164 distributed across the genome, a major cluster of junctions representing local deletions 165 and between the 5' UTR and the rest of the genome, and horizontal clusters of low-166 frequency junctions between common start sites at position ~2000 and ~8000 and the 167 rest of the genome (Figure 1D). Overall, these data demonstrate that extensive RNA 168 recombination in both MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 generates diverse populations of 169 junctions with similar high-abundance clusters. 170 171 To determine whether high-frequency recombination occurs randomly across MERS-172 CoV and SARS-CoV-2 genomes, we calculated mean positional recombination 173 frequency (Figure 1E-F) by comparing the number of nucleotides in detected junctions 174 (both start and stop sites) at that position normalized to nucleotide depth at that 175 position. The first and last 5000 nucleotides of both MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 176 genomes showed clusters of recombination (Figure 1E-F). SARS-CoV-2 had many 177 peaks of recombination frequency of greater than 0.50 (50%) across the genome 178 (Figure 1F), suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 generates a diverse set of RNA molecules 179 with distinct genetic architectures through recombination. 180 181 Direct RNA Nanopore sequencing of MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 defines the 182 architecture of full-length genome, subgenomic RNAs, and defective viral 183",

Our results are likely an underestimate of total numbers and diversity based 214 on the conservative bioinformatic limitation of analysis to isoforms with at least 3 215 supporting reads. Thus, both MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 engage in extensive RNA 216 recombination during replication in cell culture, producing diverse junctions across the 217 viral genomes and many recombined RNA isoforms, with the indication that SARS-CoV-218 2 recombination exceeds that of MERS-CoV in Vero cells. These findings underline the 219 importance of defining the determinants of CoV recombination. 220 221 The b-coronavirus murine hepatitis virus (MHV) lacking nsp14-ExoN activity has 222 significantly decreased and altered distribution of RNA recombination events. In 223 picornaviruses and alphaviruses, recombination is regulated by determinants of 224 replication fidelity (Kempf et al., 2016; Li et al., 2019; Poirier et al., 2015; Woodman et 225 al., 2018). CoVs encode a 3'-5' exoribonuclease (ExoN) in non-structural protein 14 226 (nsp14) that regulates replication fidelity by RNA proofreading (Eckerle et al., 2007; 227 Ferron et al., 2018b; Minskaia et al., 2006). No proofreading-deficient nsp14-ExoN 228 catalytic mutant has been rescued in MERS-CoV or SARS-CoV-2. We have rescued 229 and extensively studied ExoN catalytic inactivation mutants (ExoN(-)) in b-CoVs murine 230 (MHV) and SARS-CoV. We used MHV and compared an engineered 231 ExoN catalytic inactivation mutant (MHV-ExoN(-)) to wild-type virus (MHV-WT). Murine 232 delayed brain tumor cells (DBT-9) were infected in triplicate with either MHV-WT or 233 MHV-ExoN(-) at an MOI of 0.01 pfu/mL and total infected cell monolayer RNA was 234 extracted when the monolayer was 95% involved in cytopathic effect and >75% intact. 235 To isolate virions, DBT-9 cell were infected in triplicate with either MHV-WT or MHV-236 ExoN(-) at an MOI of 0.01 pfu/mL and virions were isolated by ultracentrifugation from 237 supernatant collected when the monolayer was 95% involved in cytopathic effect and 238 >90% intact.

We 242 found that MHV-ExoN(-) had significantly decreased Jfreq relative to MHV-WT in both 243 infected cells (Figure 3B) and virions (Figure 3D).244 245 We next tested whether loss of nsp14-ExoN activity altered the population of junction 246 sites. Recombination junctions detected by ViReMa were plotted according to their start 247 (5') and stop (3') sites in infected cell RNA (Figure 3C, Figure S2C-D) and virion RNA 248 (Figure 3E, Figure S3C-D). MHV-WT displayed clusters of junctions (i) between the 5' 249 and 3' ends of the genome, (ii) between intermediate genomic positions and the 3' end 250 of the genome, (iii) between the 5' UTR and the rest of the genome, (iv) in local 251 deletions across the genome, and (v) within the 3' end of the genome (Figure 3C and 252 3E). Similarly, MHV-ExoN(-) accumulated junction clusters between the 5' and 3' ends 253 genome and within the 3' end of the genome (Figure 3C and 3E). However, MHV-254 ExoN(-) had fewer junctions between the 5' UTR and the rest of the genome and fewer 255 junctions forming local deletions (Figure 3C and 3E). Together, these findings show that 256 loss of MHV nsp14-ExoN activity resulted in decreased recombination frequency and 257 altered junction patterns across the genome. 258 259 Loss of nsp14-ExoN activity alters recombination in distinct genomic regions. To 260 determine whether the engineered defect in nsp14-ExoN alters recombination across 261 the genome, we calculated and compared mean positional recombination frequencies of 262 MHV-WT (blue) and MHV-ExoN(-) (orange) in both infected cell monolayers (Figure 4A) 263 and virions (Figure 4B). MHV-WT has high recombination frequency at the 5' and 3' 264 ends of the genome as well as at distinct sites across the genome.

We next determined whether loss of nsp14-284 ExoN activity influences sgmRNA patterns and abundance, as proposed in earlier 285 studies (Eckerle et al., 2007; Minskaia et al., 2006). We quantified recombination 286 junction frequencies (Jfreq) of each of the known junctions formed between the common 287 TRS-L and 6 sgmRNA-specific body TRSs. sgmRNA Jfreq refers to the number of 288 nucleotides corresponding to the sgmRNA leader-body junction normalized to mapped 289 library size. sgmRNAs 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 were significantly decreased in MHV-ExoN(-) 290 infected cell RNA (Figure 4C). sgmRNA 4 and 6 were present at significantly decreased 291 frequencies in MHV-ExoN(-) virions compared to MHV-WT (Figure 4D). Thus, MHV-292 ExoN(-) has altered frequency of multiple sgmRNAs both in infected cells and in virus 293 particles. 294 295 We further defined alterations to different populations of recombined RNA molecules in 296 MHV-ExoN(-) compared to MHV-WT by quantifying the percentages of sgmRNA and 297 DVG junctions in the total population of detected junctions. Any junction that did not 298 form a canonical leader-body TRS junction was considered a DVG junction, likely 299 of previously undefined non-canonical or alternative sgmRNA 300 junctions. The percentage of sgmRNA junctions were significantly decreased and the 301 percentage of DVG junctions significantly increased in both infected cell RNA (Figure 3024E) and virion RNA (Figure 4F). These findings demonstrate that loss of nsp14-ExoN 303 activity alters the locations at which the replicase machinery recombines across the 304 genome, resulting in both decreased and altered sgmRNAs and relatively increased 305 percentage of DVGs in MHV-ExoN(-) compared to MHV-WT. Thus, catalytic inactivation 306 of nsp14-ExoN results in a defect in recombination site selection. 307 308 Differential abundance of recombination junctions in MHV-ExoN(-) reveals altered 309 recombination junction site selection. We next defined the distribution of 310 recombination junctions with altered abundance in MHV-ExoN(-) compared to MHV-WT. 311 We quantified the abundance junctions identified over three independent experiments 312 and identified junction populations with altered abundances in MHV-ExoN(-) compared 313 to MHV-WT using DESeq2 (Love et al., 2014). MHV-ExoN(-) RNA contained distinct 314 junction populations with both significantly increased and decreased abundance relative 315 to MHV-WT in infected cells (Figure S5A,Table S5) and in virus particles (Figure S5B, 316Table S5).

            "text": "4G-H). Recombination junctions enriched in MHV-ExoN(-) were mainly found between 318 the 5' and 3' ends of the genome (Figure 4G-H). This observation suggests that MHV-319 ExoN(-) is accumulating altered populations of DVGs that are formed by these 320 decreased abundance in MHV-ExoN(-) compared to MHV-WT in both 323 infected cells (Figure 4G) and virions (Figures 4H) mainly clustered between the 5' UTR 324 and the rest of the genome. Further, infected cell RNA demonstrates a cluster of 325 junctions with decreased abundance in MHV-ExoN(-) in the 3' end of the genome that 326 represent local deletions in this region (Figure 4G). This finding was complemented by 327 the cluster of decreased abundance of local deletions of 10 -50 bp in length across the 328 genome in MHV-ExoN(-) virion RNA (Figure 4H). Together, these findings demonstrate 329 that the populations of recombination junctions that were differentially abundant in MHV-330 ExoN(-) were not randomly distributed across the genome. This suggests that loss of 331 nsp14-ExoN activity results in altered recombination site selection in distinct regions of 332 the genome. 333 334 Direct RNA Nanopore sequencing identifies defects in MHV-ExoN(-) full-length 335 recombined RNA populations. To test the alterations of full-length recombined RNAs 336 due to loss of nsp14-ExoN proofreading activity, we sequenced MHV-WT and MHV-337 ExoN(-) virion RNA by direct RNA Nanopore sequencing. Reads were mapped to the 338 MHV genome using minimap2 and mapped reads containing both genomic termini were 339 identified. MHV-WT virion RNA contained 101,714 complete molecules and MHV-340 ExoN(-) virion RNA yielded 19,334 (Table S1). Reads mapping to the full-length 341 parental genome were not observed, likely due to the length (31.4 kb) of the MHV 342 genome, and datasets yielded only sgmRNAs and DVGs. MHV-ExoN(-) consistently 343 demonstrated ~1 log10 reduction in nucleotide depth at positions across the genome 344 relative to MHV-WT (Figure 5A). This finding directly corroborated the decreased 345 fewer full-length molecules sequenced, MHV-ExoN(-) had a global 349 decrease in the number of junctions across the genome (Figure 5B). Because 350 molecules with multiple junctions in a single molecule were detected but not supported 351 by more than one read, they were excluded from downstream analyses. We next 352 mapped junctions detected in full-length RNA molecules according to their genomic 353 position (Figure 5C). While MHV-WT contains 852 unique junctions present in full-length 354 molecules, MHV-ExoN(-) had only 43 (Table S3). MHV-WT recombination junctions 355 exclusively connect positions in the first ~8,000 nucleotides of the genome to the 3' UTR 356 (Figure 5C). MHV-ExoN(-) had fewer junction sites, none of which represented distinct 357 clusters (Figure 5D). We next grouped junctions within 10-base pair windows to define 358 distinct families of molecules supported by at least three reads. Nine such architectures 359 were identified in MHV-WT (Figure 5E). These populations contain both DVGs and 360 sgmRNAs. The four most abundant isoforms were also detected in MHV-ExoN(-) virion 361 RNA, which corresponded to a DVG and sgmRNAs 4,6 and 7 (Figure 5E). We did not 362 detect MHV-ExoN(-)-unique variants with at least 3 supporting reads, potentially due to 363 their low frequency in the population and the limited depth of Nanopore sequencing. 364 Additionally, all junctions generating RNA molecules found in MHV-WT and MHV-365 ExoN(-) were present in short-read RNA-seq datasets. These data demonstrate that 366 loss of nsp14-ExoN activity drives the accumulation altered recombined RNA 367 populations and DVG species diversity. study, we define the diversity of the CoV recombination landscape in MHV, 371 MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2. We also demonstrate that the loss of nsp14-ExoN 372 activity in MHV results in decreased recombination and alters site selection of 373 recombination junctions. Our results support a model in which nsp14-ExoN activity 374 functions during replication to drive normal recombination, leading to the generation of 375 populations of discrete molecules, including sgmRNAs and DVGs. 376 377 MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 have extensive recombination networks producing 378 diverse populations of RNA species. We show that both MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-379 2, the etiological agent of the ongoing global pandemic of COVID-19, performs 380 extensive recombination and generates diverse populations of RNA molecules. SARS-381 CoV-2 demonstrated relatively increased recombination frequency compared to MERS-382 CoV and displayed unique clusters of recombination junctions across the SARS-CoV-2 383 genome. We analyzed SARS-CoV-2 propagated from a clinical isolate that had been 384 passaged in cell culture, while MERS-CoV was generated from an isogenic clone of low 385 passage. It is possible that the differences could be the result of the diversity and 386 composition of the original sample or propagation in different cell types. Alternatively, 387 these differences may be due to alterations in transcription and RNA synthesis kinetics 388 in SARS-CoV-2 compared to MERS-CoV, which have not been previously defined. It 389 will be important for future studies to determine the role of the diversity of the viral 390 population, cell environment, and virus-specific RNA synthesis kinetics in viral 391 Nanopore sequencing on the Oxford Nanopore Technologies MinION 395 platform has sequenced sgmRNAs and DVGs in the alpha-coronavirus human 396 coronavirus 229E (HCoV-229E) (Viehweger et al., 2019) and has been utilized to 397 identify putative sgmRNAs in SARS-CoV-2 (Kim et al., 2020; Taiaroa et al., 2020). 398 Direct RNA Nanopore sequencing further revealed the profound diversity of RNA 399 species produced by SARS-CoV-2 during infection and yielded the first reported full-400 length, continuous direct RNA reads of SARS-CoV-2. The full-length genome 401 sequences are currently the longest and most complete direct RNA Nanopore 402 sequences reported for any CoV. Detection of multiple RNA molecules with similar but 403 distinct genetic architectures corresponding to a single open reading frame suggests 404 that SARS-CoV-2 produces alternative transcripts. Tandem genetic and proteomic 405 studies of sgmRNA species in SARS-CoV-2 will be valuable to experimentally define 406 populations of translated SARS-CoV-2 sgmRNAs their role in viral replication. 407 408Murine hepatitis virus (MHV) incorporates diverse recombinant RNA in its virions. 409Comparison of recombination in MHV-infected cells and virus particles (virions)410 revealed that the observed recombination patterns and species generated in infected 411 cells are largely retained in virions. Specifically, we observed three previously 412 unexpected recombination junction clusters: (1) junctions connecting the canonical 5' 413 TRS-L to non-canonical positions across the genome; (2) junctions representing small 414 of the genome, including structural proteins and the 3' UTR. This result was 416 surprising based on earlier studies reporting the requirement of specific packaging 417 signals for incorporation of select RNA species into the virions (Kuo and Masters, 2013). 418 Our direct RNA Nanopore sequencing studies show that MHV virions contain a diverse 419 population of recombined RNA molecules which exclude the canonical MHV packaging 420 signal at position 20,273 -20,367 (Kuo and Masters, 2013). Thus, MHV may have 421 much lower barriers for packaging a diverse population of RNA species than previously 422 known, which may aid in the transmission and accumulation of DVGs even under low-423 MOI conditions. 424 425 MHV lacking nsp14-ExoN activity has globally decreased and altered 426 recombination. MHV-ExoN(-) demonstrated a global decrease in recombination 427 junction frequency in both infected cells and virions while also exhibiting skewed 428 populations of sgmRNAs, an increased proportion of DVGs, and altered populations of 429 recombinant isoforms. Our findings demonstrate a novel role for nsp14-ExoN in CoV 430 RNA recombination and further suggest that loss of nsp14-ExoN activity results in 431 altered recombination site selection. Decreased recombination frequency at canonical 432 TRSs in MHV-ExoN(-) suggest that there is decreased accumulation of sgmRNAs. This 433 finding is supported by previous studies (Eckerle et al., 2007; Minskaia et al., 2006) that 434 report a defect in MHV-ExoN(-) sgmRNA synthesis. Perturbation of the abundance of 435 each sgmRNA will likely have a profound influence on the fitness and virulence of CoVs 436 as sgmRNAs encode critical viral proteins including nucleocapsid (N), spike (S), and 437 ExoN(-) virion RNA demonstrates a significant increase in recombination in five 441 distinct genomic regions: 1) nsp3, 2) nsp4, 3) nsp12, 4) the spike (S) protein, and 5) the 442 3' UTR. Previous studies show that CoV DVGs frequently contain sequences from the 443 first replicase proteins after the 5' UTR (Kim et al.; Makino; Makino et al., 1984, 1988; 444 Penzes et al., 1996). Increased recombination in nsp3 and nsp4 may be the result of 445 altered DVG formation and increased accumulation in virus particles. Some of the 446 detected DVGs may be non-canonical sgmRNAs, containing junctions near the TRSs 447 and potentially encode novel translation reading frames (Di et al., 2017; Viehweger et 448 al., 2019). 449 450 Loss of MHV nsp14-ExoN activity results in altered recombination site selection. 451 Differential abundance analysis, mapping of junction detected in multiple experiments, 452 and direct RNA Nanopore sequencing suggest that defective nsp14-ExoN activity drives 453 altered recombination site selection resulting in different populations of accumulated 454 molecules. In this model, abrogation of nsp14-ExoN activity would cause altered 455 replicase activity, resulting in selection of aberrant sites, potentially based on sequence 456 or structural elements. In both picornaviruses and alphaviruses, low fidelity mutant 457 viruses have altered polymerase speed and processivity (Campagnola et al., 2015) and 458 these properties contribute to recombination and the generation of defective interfering 459 particles (Kim et al., 2019; Langsjoen et al., 2020; Poirier et al., 2015). The MHV-ExoN(-may have altered protein-protein interactions that change the stability of the 461 complex and drive altered site selection. Alternatively, loss of nsp14-ExoN activity may 462 result in defective replicase-RNA interactions and therefore cause altered RNA 463 recombination site selection. In both models, nsp14-ExoN activity is an important 464 determinant of replicase activity during RNA synthesis and recombination. However, 465 there are likely other determinants of recombination in the CoV replicase that will be 466 important to define through future genetic and structure-function studies. 467 468 In this study, we identify key positions across the genome that are involved in 469 recombination junctions in the model b-CoV, MHV and we establish nsp14-ExoN 470 proofreading activity as a key determinant of recombination in b-CoVs. Our previous 471 studies of MHV nsp14-ExoN findings genetics and functions have been directly 472 reproduced in SARS-CoV (Agostini et al., 2018; Eckerle et al., 2010; Smith et al., 2013). 473 Thus, we would predict that SARS-CoV-2, will demonstrate the requirement of nsp14-474 ExoN activity for recombination. Further, treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection with small 475 molecules that target the replicase proteins including nsp14-ExoN may result in an 476 altered recombination landscape and perturb viral fitness. It will be important for future 477 studies to assess the role of RNA proofreading, replication fidelity, and small molecule 478 antivirals in recombination of SARS-CoV-2. Understanding the relationship between 479 protein determinants in RNA recombination will provide new targets for countermeasure 480 development to combat emergence of novel CoVs from animal reservoirs with 481 members of the Denison laboratory for insightful discussions regarding this 485 study.

Briefly, after quality control, polyadenylated RNA 665 during library preparation. Isolated RNA was heat fragmented and libraries 666 were prepared for 2 x 250 nucleotide paired-end sequencing performed (Illumina). 667 Genewiz performed basecalling and read demultiplexing. 668 Direct RNA Nanopore sequencing. RNA from ultracentrifuge-purified virions was 669 prepared for direct RNA Nanopore sequencing on the Oxford Nanopore Technologies 670 MinION platform according to the manufacturer's protocols. Libraries were sequenced 671 on fresh MinION R9.4 flow-cells for 24 hours, or until the pore occupancy was under 672 20%.

Raw reads were processed by first 678 removing the Illumina TruSeq adapter using Trimmomatic (Bolger et al., 2014) 679 default settings (command line parameters java -jar trimmomatic.jar PE 680 sample_R1.fastq.gz sample_R2.fastq.gz output_paired_R1.fastq 681 output_unpaired_R1.fastq output_paired_R2.fastq 682 output_unpaired_R2_unpaired.fastq ILLUMINACLIP:TruSeq3-683 PE.fa:2:30:10 LEADING:3 TRAILING:3 SLIDINGIWINDOW:4:15 684 MINLEN:36). Reads shorter than 36 bp were removed and low-quality bases (Q score 685 < 30) were trimmed from read ends. The raw FASTQ files were aligned to the MHV-A59 686 genome (AY910861.1), the MERS-CoV genome (JX869059.2), and the SARS-CoV-2 687 genome (MT020881.1) using the Python2 script ViReMa (Viral Recombination Mapper) Routh and Johnson, 2014) using the command line parameters python2 ViReMa.py 689 reference_index input.fastq output.sam --OuputDir sample_virema/ 690 --OutputTag sample_virema -BED --MicroIndelLength 5. The sequence 691 alignment map (SAM) file was processed using the samtools (Li et al., 2009) suite to 692 calculate nucleotide depth at each position in a sorted binary alignment map (BAM) file 693 (using command line parameters samtools depth -a -m 0 694 sample_virema.sorted.bam > sample_virema.coverage). 695 Recombination junction analysis. Recombination junction frequency (Jfreq) was 696 calculated by comparing the number of nucleotides in detected recombination junctions 697 to the total number of mapped nucleotides in a library. Nucleotides in detected 698 recombination junctions were quantified as a sum of nucleotide depth reported at each 699 junction in the BED file generated by ViReMa. Total nucleotides mapped to the MHV-700 A59 genome were quantified as a sum of nucleotide depth at each position across the 701 genome in the tab-delineated text file generated by the samtools. Jfreq was reported as 702 junctions per 10 4 nucleotides sequenced. Mean Jfreq values were compared between 703 MHV-WT and MHV-ExoN(-) and statistical significance determined by an unpaired 704 student's t-test. Junctions were mapped across the genome according to their start (5') 705 and stop (3') positions. These junctions were first filtered in the forward (5' \u00e0 3') 706 direction using the dpylr package (RStudio). The frequency of each junction was 707 calculated by comparing the depth of the unique junction to the total number of 708 nucleotides in all detected junctions in a library. Junctions were plotted according to the 709 genomic position and colored according to log10 of the frequency using ggplot2 in 710 was calculated at each genomic position by dividing the 712 number of nucleotides in any junction mapping to the position divided by the total 713 number of nucleotides sequenced at the position. Mean recombination frequencies 714 were compared between MHV-WT and MHV-ExoN(-) for three independent sequencing 715 experiments by a two-way ANOVA statistical analysis with multiple comparisons. 716 Identification of sgmRNA and DVG junctions. Forward recombination junctions were 717 classified as either canonical sgmRNA junctions or DVG junctions based on the position 718 of their junction sites and filtered in Microsoft Excel. Briefly, junction start sites were 719 filtered to those positioned between nucleotide 62 -72 in the genome. The stop sites 720 were then filtered for those positioned within each respective sgmRNA TRS. sgmRNA 721 frequency was calculated by dividing the sum of the depth of all junctions corresponding 722 to an individual sgmRNA by the total number of mapped nucleotides at each position. 723 The filtered sgmRNA junctions were compiled and DVG junctions were filtered in 724 RStudio by performing an exclusionary anti_join() using dplyr. DVG junctions 725 were filtered in the forward direction. The percentage of sgmRNA and DVG junctions 726 was calculated by comparing the depth of all filtered sgmRNA or DVG junctions to the 727 sum of all detected forward junctions. Mean percent sgmRNA and DVG was compared 728 between three independent sequencing experiments in virion RNA. Statistical 729 significance was determined by a 2-way ANOVA test with multiple comparisons. 730 Differential abundance of junctions. To compare the abundance of junctions in MHV-731 A59 and MHV-ExoN(-), the ViReMa output list of junctions was analyzed by in-house 732 scripts (https://github.com/DenisonLabVU) and the R package DESeq2 (Love et al., 733 2014). Junctions significantly up-or down-regulated in MHV-ExoN(-) were visualized 734 bioinfokit (Bedre, 2020) and further mapped according to their genomic 735 positions. Statistical significance was determined by the p-value of each junction 736 calculated by the DESeq2 package in RStudio and junctions with a significant alteration 737 of abundance in MHV-ExoN(-) compared to MHV-WT were visualized as either red or 738 green in the graph generated by bioinfokit. 739 Direct RNA Nanopore alignment and analysis. Live basecalling was performed by 740 Guppy in MinKNOW. Run statistics were generated from each sequencing experiment by 741 NanoPlot (De Coster et al., 2018). Pass reads from all three experiments were 742 concatenated for each virus and aligned to the genome using minimap2 (Li, 2018) and 743 FLAIR (Full Length Alternative Isoforms of RNA) (Tang et al., 2018) to generate 744 alignment files and BED files listing deletions detected in each sequenced RNA 745 molecule. Both BAM and BED files were filtered for full length molecules using 746 samtools and Microsoft Excel, respectively. Full-length MHV molecules were defined 747 as encoding coverage at positions 71 and 31034, representing the canonical TRS-L and 748 beginning of the 3' UTR required for replication. Because no TRS sequences have been 749 experimentally confirmed in either MERS-CoV or SARS-CoV-2, we filtered both 750 datasets for those that included any sequence of the 5' UTR and 3' UTR of the 751 respective viruses. BED files generated by the flair align module were parsed based on 752 the number of junctions were identified. Nanopore reads containing only 1 junction were 753 identified using Microsoft Excel and unique junctions were quantified in RStudio using 754 base-R functions. Sequencing coverage maps were generated from samtools depth 755 analysis of filtered BAM files. All junctions present in sequenced libraries were mapped 756 in Sashimi plots generated by the Integrated Genome Viewer (IGV) (Robinson et al., present in full-length MHV RNA molecules with a single deletion were 758 mapped according to their genomic positions as previously described. The genetic 759 architectures of full-length RNA molecules sequenced by direct RNA Nanopore 760 sequencing were visualized by filtering RNA molecules for at least 3 supporting reads. 761 Low frequency variants were removed from this analysis. 762 763 Table S3.
