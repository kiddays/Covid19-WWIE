Thus, it is possible that a contributing factor influencing this mortality rate could be the overall population age (i.e. being the oldest European country with around 23% of elderly residents) and related co-morbidity However, the high rate of infection in specific Italian geographical areas (e.g. Lombardy region) might not be exclusively related to age. At the moment, there is no vaccine and no approved specialized treatment but only drugs under investigation in clinical trials such as existing repurposed drugs (i.e. remdesivir, hydroxychloroquine or alphainterferon (IFN)), and several novel agents targeting key virus-host interactions [4] .",

Anyway, it seems established that the overall number of people positive to the molecular testing (i.e. confirmed cases) is not the total number of infected people, which is expected to be much higher. As consequence, lack of data on predicting COVID-19's spread and rate of infection results in a global impact of public health concern. The World Health Organization classifies as confirmed case, \"a person with laboratory confirmation of COVID-19 infection\" (https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/situationreports/20200331-sitrep-71-covid-19.pdf?sfvrsn=4360e92b_4). Reliable test data is therefore necessary to better assess the validity of the information related to the pandemic spread, positive cases, deaths and immune individuals. Moreover, the apparent lack of systematic testing and protocol in most countries represents the main source of discrepancies in mortality rates. Testing for COVID-19 can be performed as follows: a) viral test (i.e. to establish whether an individual is currently infected), and b) serology (i.e. to prove host immune antibodies response to the virus). As known, serological test is not only an effective tool to target immune population but also to date viral spread through a population [5] .

However, for many nations, including Italy, accurate epidemiological data on serological testing is at the present under evaluation. To contribute in filling this gap and increasing our knowledge of COVID-19 pandemic in Italy, we have decided to carry out a survey of the employees of one National Research Hospital, the IRCCS-\"Burlo Garofolo\", located in Trieste (North-Eastern Italy). An overall number of 727 employees have been recruited and tested for both viral and antibody tests in a very short timeframe (one week) in order to minimize possible biases in the study design. Multivariate analysis including COVID-19 personal and work risk exposures as well healthy status including COVID-19 related symptoms have been performed. The extremely interesting results obtained from this study are here detailed, suggesting, for the first time, the efficacy of combined testing strategy to monitor COVID-19 spread highlighting that immune specific reactive people represent a quite high number in our geographic area.",

We also further investigated the health care occupation category. Logistic regression data suggest that being medical doctor is a statistically significant risk factor for a P/B antibody test (OR=1.82, p-value=0.0127, model adjusted for sex, age and exposure risk) (Table 1) . Moreover, despite females are more frequent among healthcare professionals, males are more represented within medical doctor group (36.32% vs 9.88 %, Chi-squared test, p-value <0.001).

This subject (female, 29 years old), belonging to the HR occupation, resulted positive either for the presence of the virus as well as the antibodies.

CHINA). Nine anonymous serum samples from subjects with different type of COVID-19 risk exposure, including samples from healthy donors with no history of SARS-CoV-2 infection or known risk exposure (negative control) and patients previously diagnosed with acute respiratory infection caused by Covid-19 (positive control) were tested and results are given in Supplementary Table 1. After this evaluation, the Wantai SARS-CoV-2 Ab Rapid Test showed the better performance. It is characterized by a chromatographic lateral flow device in a cassette format using the colloidal gold conjugated recombinant antigens method. The SARS-CoV-2 specific antibody binds with the gold conjugated antigens forming particles generating a visible T red line. A Control Zone (C) red line indicates the validity of the test.

In addition, antibody tests may hold important clues to COVID-19 exposure and should be performed. Thus, a general population screening could increase our understanding of the pandemic spread and the relevant risks in different populations. In this light, there is a strong need of serological testing for COVID-19 antibodies, able to rapidly select subjects showing specific immune response.Studies performed so far (https://www.nejm.org/coronavirus), provided only a \"snapshot\" of the virus spread, not accounting for asymptomatic infections, or people who are immune. Thus, here, for the first time, a complete overview of employees from an Italian Mother-Child Research Hospital has been performed. Results reported in this paper, demonstrated the presence of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 in 17,2% of subjects. They were negative for the presence of the virus in nasopharingeal/oropharingeal sample and asymptomatic at the time of sampling. To note, a proportion of 21.7% of them referred the absence of any sign and symptom in the last three months and thus may be considered true asymptomatic. Among referred symptoms, a strong significant association was found for nose stuffiness and conjunctivitis while less significant with muscular pain. No other association was found including the presence or absence of a flu vaccination in season 2019/2020. Extremely interesting results were obtained looking at the distribution of P/B and N subjects in the three risk categories (HR, MR and LR). As expected, P/B individuals were overrepresented in both HR and MR group indicating an over exposition to the virus in these categories as compared toadministrative staff in which only the 9.5% was positive. During the last month, the majority of administrative staff was employed in a \"smart working\" activity, which could have had an impact in lowering the proportion of antibodies positive cases as compared to MR and HR groups. Moreover, our data are in agreement with those recently reported to the press (15 th April 2020) for the whole municipality of Robbio Lomellina (Lombardy, Italy) (100 positive out of 910 = 11%). Preliminary data just announced (17 th April 2020) to the press on 10.000 symptomatic and asymptomatic cases with positive contacts from Lombardy and Liguria are also in agreement (more then 10% of individuals with antibodies against SARS-CoV-2) with our findings. Finally, a preliminary German study has investigated the presence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in the population of Gangelt, a municipality of around 12,000 people demonstrating that 14% of the population is immune to the SARS-CoV-2 (https://www.nature.com/articles/d41591-020-00011-3).",
