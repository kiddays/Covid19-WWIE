We identified a H3N2 genome with the oseltamivir resistant S331R mutation in the NA protein, potentially associated with the emergence of a distinct intra-subtype reassortant. Whole genome phylogeny refuted suspicions of a transmission cluster in the infectious diseases ward, but identified two other clusters that likely reflected nosocomial transmission, associated with a predominant strain circulating in the community. We also detected a range of other potentially pathogenic viruses and bacteria from the metagenome.",

IAV can cause both seasonal epidemics and occasional pandemics, presenting a significant challenge to public health [3] . Seasonal epidemics are estimated to cause half a million deaths globally each year, primarily among young children and the elderly [4] . Estimates suggest a future pandemic could infect 20% to 40% of the world population and cause over 30 million deaths within six months [5, 6] . Tracking and characterization of circulating influenza viruses, in both human and animal populations, is critical to provide early warning of the emergence of novel variants with high virulence and to inform vaccine design.",

Among 1,039 H3N2 IAVs tested globally during the 2018/19 season, one strain from South Korea showed reduced susceptibility to oseltamivir due to this mutation [22] . Our analysis demonstrates that IAVs carrying this mutation from the 2018/19 season belong to a distinct genotype generated through intra-subtype reassortment between clades 3C.2a1b and 3C.2a2. A previous study reported a similar observation that the emergence and rapid global spread of adamantane resistant H3N2 IAVs (conferred by a S31N mutation in the M2 protein) was associated with a single genotype generated through intra-subtype reassortment [23, 24] . S31N now occurs in almost all circulating IAV globally, causing the cessation of use of adamantane to treat influenza [16] . The genesis, prevalence, distribution and clinical impact of the S331R mutation merits additional study to evaluate potential implications for the clinical usefulness of oseltamivir, which is widely used as a first-line agent when treatment is indicated [20] .",

Another possibility is that the SISPA method is less sensitive for certain viruses [26] . Moreover, no influenza B virus reads are present in our 90 influenza-positive samples, congruent with the global low level of influenza B virus during the 2018/19 season.
