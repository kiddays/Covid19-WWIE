While ODE, PDE and SDE models provide descriptions at the population level, agent-based models are centered around formulations of the properties and dynamics of individuals. Some models explicitly account for space (usually in terms of countries, regions and/or cities) to capture spreading. Furthermore, models for the infection spread are usually combined with models of testing and reporting strategy to link them to the observed case number [20] .",

Yet, all these models rely on estimates of parameter values. The parameters of epidemiological models are mostly inferred using frequentist and Bayesian parameter estimation methods. Frequentist methods often rely on parameter optimisation for obtaining point estimates and profile likelihoods for uncertainty analysis [21] . Bayesian methods exploit sampling strategies such as Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods [20, 22] or variational inference [23] . Also flexible emulator based methods based, e.g. on Gaussian process, have been applied [24] . For applications in which competing hypotheses are available, the parameter estimation is often complemented by model selection. Established model selection measures include the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) [25] , the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) [26] , or Bayes factors [27] .",

As the result of the analysis of the infection dynamics carried out in the previous section was inconclusive, we considered model M1 to M4. For all 12 combinations of model structures and intervention effects, we performed parameter estimation and uncertainty analysis. The assessment of the model selection criteria provided support for a discrete change in the transmission rate on January 22 ( Figure 7A ). The resulting model provides an accurate description of the data and suggests that the transmission rate dropped by around 71% ( Figure 7B ). The uncertainty estimates for the decrease (\u2206) depend heavily on the analysis approach. While MCMC sampling yields a 99% credibility interval from 37.9 to 76.4%, the profiles suggests a much broader regime ( Figure 7C ). Accordingly, the reported case number for the early outbreak were not sufficient for an accurate assessment of all model parameters. Despite the parameter uncertainties, the states seem to be relatively well determined ( Figure 7D ).",

These data are being collected and analysed [54, [66] [67] [68] , but should in the future be shared much earlier.

While we demonstrate this aspect here for deterministic compartmental models -which are the basis of many modelling studies for COVID-19 and beyond -it certainly holds also for other modelling approaches.
