Genetically unrelated 42 viruses can subvert analogous subcellular mechanisms and use similar 43 trafficking pathways for successful entry. Antiviral strategies targeting early 44 steps of infection are therefore appealing, particularly when the probability for 45 successful interference through a common step is highest. We describe here 46 potent inhibitory effects on content release and infection by chimeric VSV 47 containing the envelope proteins of EBOV (VSV-EBOV) or SARS-CoV-2 (VSV-48 SARS-CoV-2) elicited by Apilimod and Vacuolin-1, small molecule inhibitors of 49 the main endosomal Phosphatidylinositol-3-Phosphate/Phosphatidylinositol 5-50 Kinase, PIKfyve. We also describe potent inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 strain 2019-51 nCoV/USA-WA1/2020 by Apilimod. These results define new tools for studying 52 the intracellular trafficking of pathogens elicited by inhibition of PIKfyve kinase 53 and suggest the potential for targeting this kinase in developing a small-molecule 54 antiviral against SARS-CoV-2.",

Binding of virus to specific host cell receptor(s) triggers 58 membrane fusion, which can occur directly at the plasma membrane or following 59 endocytic uptake. Viruses that require endocytic uptake can use different initial 60 trafficking routes to reach the site of membrane fusion. In endosomes, acidic pH serves 61 to triggers conformational rearrangements in the viral envelope proteins that catalyze 62 membrane fusion, as seen for influenza A virus (IAV) and vesicular stomatitis virus blocking PIKfyve kinase has the same downstream effects on these viruses, even 113 though VSV-eGFP-SARS-CoV-2 does not require interaction with NPC1 for membrane 114 fusion. Apilimod also inhibits infection by authentic SARS-CoV-2 strain 2019-115 nCoV/USA-WA1/2020 virus, with an IC50 slightly lower than its IC50 for the VSV-eGFP-116 SARS-CoV-2. We suggest that Apilimod, which has passed safety tests in previous 117 human clinical trials for non-viral indications (24, 25, 29, 30), is a potential starting point 118 for developing small-molecule entry inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 that could limit infection 119 and disease pathogenesis. 120 was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder.

            "text": "VSV). For Ebola virus (EBOV), proteolytic processing of the envelope protein by host 64 cell proteases (1) is necessary to expose the receptor binding domain prior to 65 engagement of Neiman Pick C1 (NPC1 or NPC Intracellular Cholesterol Transporter 1) 66 -the late endosomal-lysosomal receptor protein (2). Proteolytic processing is also 67 required for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) (3, 4), and for 68 the current pandemic SARS-CoV-2 (5). Lassa fever virus (LASV) uses a different 69 mechanism, binding alpha-dystroglycan at the plasma membrane (6), for internalization 70 with a subsequent pH-regulated switch that leads to engagement of lysosomal 71 associated membrane protein 1 (LAMP1) for membrane fusion (7). Lymphocytic 72 choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) also uses alpha-dystroglycan (6) and is internalized in a 73 manner that depends on endosomal sorting complexes required for transport (ESCRT) 74 proteins (8), although it remains unknown whether a second receptor is required. 75 76 A hallmark of the endolysosomal system is controlled dynamic trafficking of vesicular 77 carriers among its various sub-compartments. Phophoinositides are markers for 78 defining the identity of these sub-compartments because they are restricted in their 79 distribution to specific intracellular membranes [reviewed in (9)]. Although it is one of the 80 least abundant of the phosphoinositides in cells, PI(3,5)P2 is particularly important for 81 endomembrane homeostasis. It is produced by PIKfyve, which phosphorylates the DP2) (10). First cloned as mammalian p235 (11), PIKfyve is a 240 84 kDa class III lipid kinase, present on the cytosolic face of endosomal membranes (swelling and vacuolation of late endosomes and endolysosomes. It 89 is thought that these changes result from decreased membrane fission and concomitant 90 interference in endosomal traffic (13, 21). Small-molecule inhibitors of PIKfyve, inhibits infection by several viruses, including ZEBOV. Although it does 99 not alter the pH of endosomes nor inhibit cathepsin B or L (26), Apilimod blocks entry of 100 ZEBOV and other pathogenic filoviruses (27). Several groups reported that Apilimod 101 prevents colocalization of VSV-ZEBOV pseudoviruses with the EBOV endosomal 102 receptor NPC1, but does not prevent colocalization with early endosomal antigen 1 103 (EEA1) (5, 27, 28). Apilimod also inhibits entry of pseudotyped viruses bearing the spike 104 proteins of MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2, as well as of authentic we have studied the effects of Apilimod on infection of VSV-eGFP-SARS-CoV-2 108 and VSV-eGFP-ZEBOV chimeras and showed that Apilimod blocks infection of both, 109 with an IC50 of ~50 nM. Apilimod and Vacuolin-1 also prevented entry and infection of 110 VSV-MeGFP-ZEBOV and many of the internalized VSV-MeGFP-ZEBOV virions 111 colocalized with NCP1 in the distended, vacuolated endosomes. This suggests that 112",

Following the incubation protocol summarized 128 in Fig 1A, we tested the effects on infection of Apilimod or Vacuolin-1; both compounds 129 are small-molecule inhibitors of PIKfyve kinase, which generates PI(5)P and PI(3,5)P2 130 in late endosomes and lysosomes. Using a flow cytometry based-assay to monitor a 131 single round of infection determined by expression of viral MeGFP (Fig. 1B), we found 132 that Apilimod and Vacuolin-1 potently inhibit VSV-MeGFP-ZEBOV infection (Fig. 1C). 133 These results agree with results obtained by others with Apilimod (26, 31), in different 134 cell types infected with MLV virus pseudotyped with EBOV G or with Ebola virus itself 135 (26, 27, 32). Apilimod was a less effective inhibitor of VSV-MeGFP-LCMV infection, and 136 Vacuolin-1 had no effect at the concentration used. In contrast, Apilimod and Vacuolin-1 137 failed to prevent infection by VSV-MeGFP, VSV-MeGFP-V269H, VSV-MeGFP-RABV, 138 or VSV-MeGFP-LASV (Fig. 1C). IN1 (33), an inhibitor of the phosphoinositide kinase 139 Vps34, the main endosomal generator of PI3P, also interfered with VSV-MeGFP-LCMV 140 and VSV-MEGFP-ZEBOV infection (Fig. 1C). All of these viruses require low pH to 141 trigger viral membrane fusion with the endosomal membranes, and as expected, 142 infection was fully blocked by Bafilomycin A1, which inhibits the vacuolar type H + -143 ATPase (V-ATPase) acidification activity (Fig. 1C). 144 145 Apilimod and Vacuolin-1 prevent cytoplasmic entry of VSV-MEGFP-ZEBOV. 146 Productive infection requires delivery of the viral ribonucleoprotein core (RNP) into the 147 cytosol. In these experiments, we deemed RNP delivery, as monitored by single cell 148 fluorescence microscopy imaging (experimental protocol summarized in Fig. 2A and 149 3A), to be successful when fluorescent MeGFP encapsulated in the incoming virus 150 appeared at the nuclear margin of infected cells. The representative examples of VSV 151 infection and RNP core release shown in Fig. 2B were obtained in the absence or 152 presence of cycloheximide, which prevents viral protein expression. In the absence of 153 cycloheximide (left panel), large amounts of newly synthesized MeGFP are present 154 throughout the cell. In the presence of cycloheximide (right panel), we observed MeGFP 155 in virions (fluorescent spots) as well as released MeGFP concentrated at the of VSV-MeGFP or VSV-MeGFP-V296H. As expected, Bafilomycin A1blocked 161 entry of all viruses (images inFig. 2C and quantification in Fig. 2D).162 163 Intracellular trafficking of virus particles in the presence of Apilimod or Vacuolin-164 1. Internalized virus particles traffic along the endocytic pathway to reach the 165 endosomal compartment(s) from which membrane fusion and genome entry into the 166 cytosol occur. To establish the identity of the endosomal compartments, we used 167 genome-editing in SVG-A cells to replace expression of a subset of proteins enriched in 168 different endosomal compartments (the small GTPases Rab5c and Rab7a, EEA1, or 169 NPC1) with their corresponding fluorescent chimeras obtained by fusion with TagRFP, 170 mScarlet, or Halo (Fig. 3B, 3C, 3E, 3F, 4B-E). The lack of fluorescently tagged fillipin (a 171 cholesterol binder) in the endolysosomal compartment in the absence but not in the 172 presence of U18666A, a potent inhibitor of NPC1 (Fig 4F), showed that NPC1-cell spinning disk confocal microscopy, we monitored the presence of virus 176 particles in the fluorescently tagged endosomes by colocalization with the fluorescent 177 spots from the virus-incorporated MeGFP. We monitored entry by carrying out the 178 experiments in the presence of cycloheximide, thus ensuring that any MeGFP 179 fluorescent signal at the nuclear margin originated only from MeGFP molecules carried 180 by incoming viral particles (Fig. 3C). All cells were maintained at 37\u00b0C throughout all 181 phases of the experiment to ensure normal and undisturbed intracellular trafficking. All 182 control experiments performed in the absence of inhibitors showed arrival of VSV-183 MeGFP, VSV-MeGFP-V296H, or VSV-MeGFP-ZEBOV virus particles to early (Rab5c 184 and EEA1) (Fig. 3D, 4E) or late endosomes and lysosomes (Rab7a or NPC1) (Fig. 3G, 185 4C, 4E). MeGFP released from all viruses appeared at the nuclear margin, showing 186 effective RNP release. NPC1, the receptor for VSV-MeGFP-ZEBOV entry is required for 187 fusion from endosomes (2). The successful VSV-MeGFP-ZEBOV infection observed in 188 the absence of drug in cells expressing NPC1-Halo alone or in combination with 189 mScarlet-EEA1 indicates that NPC1-Halo is capable of facilitating infection and that 190 VSV-MeGFP-ZEBOV trafficked to NPC1-Halo-containing endosomes.",

            "text": "low pH compartments where cathepsins are active. Coronaviruses 228 may enter directly by fusion at the plasma membrane or following receptor mediated 229 endocytosis. Cell entry of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 depends on the protease 230 TMPRSS2 in conjunction with ACE2 (34-37), and when TMPRSS2 is present, inhibition of viruses from all three groups by Apilimod is a consequence of 234 perturbing their shared entry pathway. Moreover, it is not the cathepsin activity itself that 235 these compounds affect, judging from the outcome of the assays with Apilimod and 236 Vacuolin-1 showing they inhibit VSV chimeras bearing the surface glycoproteins of 237 ZEBOV and LCMV and to a lesser extent LASV. Apilimod also inhibits infection of cells 238 by VSV-SARS-CoV-2 as well as by authentic SARS-CoV-2; neither compound blocks 239 infection by wild-type VSV. For VSV-ZEBOV, we have shown that the virus reaches a 240 compartment enriched in NPC1, the EBOV co-receptor, and often also enriched in 241 EEA1, but that it nonetheless fails to release internal proteins into the cytosol. Apilimod 242 does not inhibit cathepsin (26) but Apilimod (39) and Vacuolin-1 (17, 23) can interfere 243 with cathepsin maturation as evidenced by an increase in pro-cathepsin in treated cells; 244 they don't influence endosomal pH (18, 26, 40) although other studies report Apilimod 245 decreases cathepsin activity (41) and Vacuolin-1 increases pH (17, 23). Irrespective of 246 this discrepancy, both Apilimod and Vacuolin-1 inhibit PI-3P-5-kinase (PIKfyve) (17, 19), 247 a three-subunit complex (14) with a PI-3P-binding FYVE domain (10, 11) that 248 recognizes the endosomal marker, PI-3-P. Functional ablation of this enzyme by 249 genetic means (12, 15) gives rise to the same cellular phenotype as treatment with 250 either compound (17-19). The similar dose-response curves for Apilimod inhibition of 251 the ZEBOV and SARS-CoV-2 chimeras (IC50 of ~ 50 nM) and of authentic SARS-CoV-252 2 virus (IC50 ~ 10 nM) are in good agreement with the IC50 of ~ 15 nM for Apilimod 253 inhibition of PIKfyve in vitro (19). Thus, perturbing normal endosomal trafficking by 254 inhibiting PIKfyve activity suggests it is the mechanism by which Apilimod and Vacuolin-255 1 block entry of such a diverse set of viral pathogens. many of which also contain the NPC1 co-receptor (2, 42), often appear to be 262 relatively immobile and adjacent to the endosomal limiting membrane. One possible 263 explanation is that when a virion reaches these distended endosomes, it can bind or 264 remain bound to the limiting membrane, but not fuse. Another is that virions may fuse 265 with smaller intraluminal vesicles in the endosomal lumen (43), but that PIinfection by authentic SARS-CoV-2 shows that the blocked release of the 270 viral genome from a vacuolated endosome is independent of the shape, size, and 271 distribution of spike protein on the virion. The assay we used to determine effects on 272 infectivity of authentic virus measured release of virions after multiple rounds of 273 infection, rather than entry, which we monitored in the VSV-SARS-CoV-2 experiments 274 by detecting eGFP synthesis in the cytosol. Nevertheless, the IC50 of Apilimod in 275 experiments with authentic virus is remarkably similar (or even better) , they have less pronounced effects when tested in animals (44). This may 280 because another protease, TMPRSS2 on the surface of cells in relevant tissues, 281 appears to prime SARS-CoV (44) and SARS-CoV-2 (37) spike proteins for efficient 282 entry. As the effectiveness of Apilimod and Vacuolin-1 does not depend on cathepsin 283 inhibition, their capacity to block entry of several distinct families of viruses is likely to be 284 independent of the identity of the protease that primes their surface glycoprotein for 285 fusion. Phase I and phase II clinical trials have shown that Apilimod is safe and well-286 tolerated (24, 25, 29, 30). The trials were discontinued because of lack of effectiveness 287",

All viruses were generated Halo, or mScarlet were cloned into the pUC19 vector (donor constructs) which 496 then served as homologous recombination repair templates for the Cas9 enzyme-497 cleaved genomic DNA. Donor constructs were obtained by a ligation of PCR 498 amplification products from the genomic DNA fragments, TagRFP, Halo, and mScarlet 499 sequences. Primers F1-R1 and F3-R3 amplified approximately 800 base pairs of 500 genomic sequences upstream and downstream of the start codon of Rab5c, Rab7a or 501 EEA1, or the stop codon of NPC1, respectively. Primers F1 and R3 contain sequences 502 complementary to the pUC19 vector linearized using the SmaI restriction enzyme (lower 503 case in the primer sequences). The TagRFP sequence containing the GGS peptide 504 linker was amplified using primers F2-R2 from a TagRFP mammalian expression 505 plasmid used as a template. The F2 primer contains complementary sequences to the 506 3' end of the F1-R1 fragment, while the F3 primer contains complementary sequences 507 to the 3' end of the TagRFP sequences. PCR products (fragments F1-R1, F2-R2, and 508 F3-R3) were subjected to electrophoresis in 1% agarose and gel purified using a 509 purification kit from Zymogen. The PCR fragments were cloned into the linearized 510 pUC19 vector using the Gibson Assembly Cloning Kit (E5510S; New England Biolabs)cells) were co-transfected with 0.8 \u00b5g of Streptococcus 516 pyogenes Cas9, 0.8 \u00b5g free PCR product coding for the target sgRNA, and 0.8 \u00b5g 517 pUC19 vector using Lipofectamine 2000 reagent (Invitrogen) according to the 518 manufacturer's instructions. Transfected cells were grown for 7 to 10 days and sorted 519 for TagRFP, Halo, or mScarlet expression using fluorescence-activated cell sorting 520 (FACS) (SH-800S; Sony). Prior to FACS, NPC1-Halo cells were labeled for 15 minutes 521 with Janelia Fluor TM 647 (JF647). Single cells expressing the desired chimera were 522 isolated, clonally expanded, and then screened by genomic PCR for TagRFP, drug or DMSO at 37\u00b0C for one hour. Following this, cells were incubated 531 for one hr at 37\u00b0C with VSV, VSV-MeGFP-V296H, VSV-MeGFP-RABV, VSV-MeGFP-532 LASV, VSV-MeGFP-LCVM or VSV-MeGFP-ZEBOV in drug or DMSO-containing 533 infection medium (\u03b1-MEM, 50mM HEPES, 2% FBS). Cells were then washed to remove 534 non-adsorbed viruses and further incubated at 37\u00b0C in medium containing the drug or 535 DMSO with experiments ending at the indicated times by fixation with 3.7% 536 formaldehyde in PBS. Fluorescent intensity from 20,000 single cells from a single round 537 of infection was determined by flow cytometry using a BD FACSCanto TM were pretreated for one h with the indicated concentration Apilimod or 541 DMSO. Pretreated cells were inoculated with VSV-eGFP, VSV-eGFP-EBOV or VSV-542 eGFP-SARS-Cov-2 at an MOI = 1 (based on titers in MA104 cells) in the presence of 543 Apilimod or DMSO for one hour at 37\u00b0C. Six to 8 hour post infection, cells were 544 collected and fixed in 2% PFA and then subjected to flow cytometry. The percentage of 545 GFP cells was determined using FlowJo software (Tree Star Industries, Ashland, OR). 546 547 Vero E6 cell monolayers were pretreated for 1 h at 37\u00b0C with serial dilutions of Apilimod 548 at the indicated concentrations. Next, SARS-CoV-2 was diluted to an MOI of 0.01 focus-549 forming units (FFU)/cell in Apilimod-containing medium and added to Vero E6 cells for 1 550 h at 37\u00b0C. After adsorption, cells were washed once with PBS, and medium containing 551 the respective concentration of Apilimod was added. Cell were incubated for a 24 h at 552 37\u00b0C, and at which time cell culture supernatants were removed and used for 553 determination of viral titer by focus forming assay. 554 555 SARS-CoV-2 focus forming assay 556 Cell culture supernatants from virus-infected cells were diluted serially 10-fold and 557 added to Vero E6 cell monolayers in 96-well plates and incubated at 37\u00b0C for 1 h. 558 Subsequently, cells were overlaid with 1% (w/v) methylcellulose in MEM supplemented 559 with 2% FBS. Plates were harvested 30 h later by removing overlays and fixed with 4% 560 paraformaldehdye in PBS for 20 min at room temperature. Plates were washed and 561 sequentially incubated with 1 \u00b5g/mL of CR3022 anti-spike antibody (51) and HRP-562 conjugated goat anti-human IgG in PBS supplemented with 0.1% saponin and 0.A cells plated on glass #1.5 coverslips at about 30-40 % confluency one day prior 571 to experiment were treated with drug or DMSO for one hr at 37\u00b0C. Following this, cells 572 were incubated at 37\u00b0C with VSV, VSV-MeGFP-V296H, VSV-MeGFP-RABV, VSV-573 MeGFP-LASV, VSV-MeGFP-LCVM or VSV-EBOV (also expressing MeGFP) in drug or 574 DMSO containing infection medium. After this, cells were washed then further incubated 575 in medium containing the drug or DMSO at 37\u00b0C with the experiment ending at the 576 indicated time by fixation for 20 min at room temperature with 3.7% formaldehyde in 577 PBS. This was followed with a10-minute incubation of 5\u00b5g/mL of Alexa647-labeled 578 wheat germ agglutinin in PBS to label the outline of the cells. 579 580 Cells were imaged using a spinning disk confocal microscope with optical planes 581 spaced 0.3 \u00b5m apart (52). The entry assay scored the presence of MeGFP at the 582 nuclear margin in each cell. Trafficking of viruses to endosomal compartments was 583 observed using live-cell imaging using the spinning disc confocal microscope. Time 584 series with images taken every three seconds for two minutes in a single optical plane 585 with the appropriate fluorescent channels (52) were acquired from non-fixed samples 586 imaged at the end of the experimental period. For experiments containing NPC1-Halo, 587 the Halo-tagged cells were labeled with either 250 nM JF549 or JF647 dye in media for 588 30 minutes at 37\u00b0C. Following labeling, cells were washed three times with media.
