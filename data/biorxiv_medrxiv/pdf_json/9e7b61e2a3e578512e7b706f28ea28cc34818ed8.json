The phylogenetic analysis performed in the present study indicated 332 that, while SARS-CoV-2 shows a high sequence homology (over 99.91-99.97%), the closest 333 relatives were strains of several Betacoronavirus, i.e., SARS-CoV, SARS-like-CoV, Bat-CoV, and 334 Pangolin-CoV, which confirmed previous results (1, 6, 30-32). The sequence identity with 335 coronaviruses isolated from Pangolin was considerably high (85-90%) which, according to other 336 authors (32-34), could be taken as a step in the course of evolutive zoonosis of SARS-CoV-2 from 337 bats. We have found that a single genome sequence (MN996532.1) of the Bat coronavirus 338 RaTG13 isolated from Rhinolophus affinis in Wuhan, showed the highest homology level (96.70%) 339to SARS-CoV-2, as previously described(1, 2, 4, 6, 34, 35).
