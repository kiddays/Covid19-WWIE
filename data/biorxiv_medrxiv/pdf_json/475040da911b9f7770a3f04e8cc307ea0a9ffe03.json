Chicago's hot spot neighborhoods, on the other hand, are among the city's most vulnerable, low-income neighborhoods with extremely high rates of poverty, unemployment, and non-Hispanic Black residents.",

For instance, according to an April 8 th Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report, of the 580 hospitalized patients in 99 counties in 14 states found that non-Hispanic (NH) black were disproportionately affected (4) . Poverty and low income have also been identified as important issues not just as a function of potentially classist policy, but also due to the increased difficulty for those in more tenuous financial situations and occupations to implement physical distancing and isolation. Individuals at or below the poverty line are affected by residential overcrowding, increased smoking rates (5) , exposures to environmental pollutants (6) , and lack of access to healthcare according to a UN report -all of which can increase the spread of the virus or cause adverse outcomes (7) . However, it is important to note that at this point there is very little data at smaller geographies (e.g., counties or sub-county units) that report on demographic or economic characteristics of those with the virus, hospitalizations, or deaths (8) .",

Additionally, these vulnerable communities' risk of having worse outcomes from COVID-19 infection may be increased due to a higher prevalence of comorbidities or underlying conditions such as asthma, diabetes, and other conditions (11) (12) (13) (14) . This suggests that existing health disparities are likely to be magnified in the context of COVID-19, and potentially extend well beyond the lifespan of the epidemic due to sociodemographic inequity, and economic hardships at the global, national, and local levels which themselves have a differential impact on individuals and populations both directly and indirectly (15) (16) (17) (18) .",

            "text": "Scale is an important element when examining any phenomenon that has a locational component, and the choice of both unit of analysis and study area can have large effects on the outcomes of the analyses. For instance, when quantifying the association between a health outcome and population density, using a county-scale could obscure the heterogeneity of both the outcome of interest (e.g., there may be very high rates in one part of the county, and low rates everywhere else) and the associated variable (e.g., one neighborhood in the county could house a large number of resident in high-rise buildings and the remainder could be low intensity single family homes and park land). This issue, often called the modifiable area unit problem (MAUP), has been documented in multiple research domains, including health (19, 20) , exposure estimation (21) , measures of access (22) , and environmental justice (23, 24) . A related phenomenon is the choice of the overall study area. For instance, based on the American Community Survey 2018 5-year estimates (25) , Staten Island, one of the boroughs of New York City, may seem to have very high population density (over 8000 people per square mile) when compared other counties in the entire U.S., some of which have values far below one person per square mile (e.g., Denali, Alaska and Esmeralda, Texas). However, Staten Island is the least densely population borough of New York City, with Manhattan having more than 70,000 residents per square mile. As such, it would appear comparatively dense at a national scale, but relatively less-dense at a city scale. Since social interaction is the basis of community transmission of the virus, it stands to reason that denser areas would be more rapidly and severely impacted than low-population areas.",

False negatives are especially problematic since the infected individual can continue to spread the virus without being aware.

Both p-values < 0.001), suggesting that it is highly unlikely for the clustered pattern to be a result of random chance. Hot spots of rates for each city were then calculated using the Getis-Ord (GI*) statistic parameterized using contiguity (i.e., ZCTAs sharing a boundary or corner). Resulting hot spots represent clusters of contiguous ZCTAs with higher values within the city (GI* was calculated once for NYC and once for CHI), whereas cold spots represent clusters of ZCTAs with low values. Clusters with >= 95% confidence were included in the analyses (figure 1). It is important to note that identifying statistical hot and cold spots is not the same as simply selecting the ZCTAs with the highest rates (e.g., top quartile). Unlike using quantiles or some other classification technique, hot (or cold) spots require clusters of ZCTAs to have high (or low) values relative to the study area which are accepted or rejected based on a significance value. .

The density is also observed in households, with NYC having nearly three times the rate of having more than one person per room compared to CHI.

In NYC overall, the ZCTA-level average shows approximately 27% of the population as NH white, 30% NH Black, and 29% Latinx/Hispanic. In Chicago, the hot spots ZCTAs are on average approximately only 4% NH white, 11% Latinx/Hispanic, and nearly 83% NH Black. Although in both cities NH white residents may be underrepresented in hot spots, Chicago shows the inequities much more clearly. Economic distinctions are even more stark. The population in NYC's hot spots are, overall, middle income with ZCTA-level average median household incomes around $70,000, which, although lower than the cold spots ($117,000), are higher than the rest of the city ($64,000). Conversely, the average median household income in Chicago's hot spots is only $35,000 with cold spots and the rest of the city being $97,000 and $63,000, respectively. Poverty rates in NYC hot and cold spots were both around 13%, whereas the rate in the rest of the city was over 18%. Chicago, on the other hand, had hot spots with poverty rates of over 30% which is higher than both cold spots (10%) and the rest of the city (18%).

The results characterize the neighborhoods (clusters of ZCTAs) and not necessarily the individuals living in those neighborhoods. The goal of this project is not to suggest causation, but rather to demonstrate the nature of SARS-CoV-2 hot and cold spots in two large U.S. cities. The information about the demographic and economic characteristics of hardest hit areas may help direct resources to mitigate the impact of COVID-19 properly and preemptively. However, the differences found, although striking, may be at least partially a function of a number of factors, including potential bias and extremely limited testing/reporting and possible false positives/negatives. For instance, it is possible that the Staten Island cluster is a result of more aggressive testing practices in those neighborhoods compared to other areas with less social or political capital. It is also important to note that this analysis is based on testing results, and do not examine COVID-19-related hospitalizations or deaths. Additionally, NYC and CHI are not only different in urban morphology and demographics, but also may be in different stages of the epidemic. The cumulative SARS-CoV-2 rates, particularly when comparatively low as is the case in some Chicago ZCTAs, can change rapidly due to the dynamic nature of infectious disease spread as well as a hopeful increase in thorough testing. However, it is clear that as of April 13, 2020, Chicago and New York City have some similarities, particularly in with respect to possible \"protective\" factors, as well as important distinctions. Further study will be needed to determine if other cities, domestic or global, have comparable trends and hypotheses will need to be generated and tested to attempt to identify associations as more complete and reliable data become more available.",
