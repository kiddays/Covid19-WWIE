This equatorial country received worldwide attention due to the excessive number of undocumented deaths upon the arrival of the SARS-CoV-2 virus within the region [35] . According to the official figures published by the National Emergency Management Committee Ecuador reported in April 16 th , at least 10,939 deaths were officially recorded during the first 45 days of the arrival of the virus in Ecuador (March to April 15 th ), a number 202% higher than the 3,622 deaths recorded during the first two months of 2020 [35] . These number is largely dependent on the number of cases reported in the province of Guayas, the province with the highest impact of the arrival of COVID-19 in the country. Although the government has not officially stated that the excessive numbers of deaths are due to COVID-19, a significant number of these deaths are likely COVID-19 related, especially when other violent causes of deaths (traffic accidents and homicides) have been reduced due to the partial cuff implemented in the country during the first week of March [36] [37] [38] .",

Regarding Latin America, 55 SARS-CoV-2 genomes have been sequenced and submitted to GISAID. Brazil analysed 20 genomes finding the ORF1a T708I, ORF1a D1036, ORF1a acid replacements; Colombia analyzed 2 genomes finding only 1 amino acid replacement; Peru analyzed 1 genome finding only 1 amino acid replacement; and, Panama analyzed 1 genome without mutations.",
