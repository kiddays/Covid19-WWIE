Initiation of viral entry requires two steps: 1) the Spike (S) protein in the viral envelope, binds to its receptor present in the plasma membrane after S protein is cleaved into S1 and S2 proteins by the cellular protease. SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 use angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), while MERS-CoV uses CD26 as a receptor; 2) S2 is cleaved by a cell surface transmembrane protease, serine 2 (TMPRSS2), so-called priming, which exposes the fusion peptide in S2 protein, allowing it to attach to the plasma membrane resulting in the fusion between envelope and the plasma membrane (envelope fusion). This fusion allows the viral RNA to enter the cytoplasm, where it replicates. TMPRSS2-knockout resulted in reduced spread of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV in the airways accompanied by reduced severity of lung pathology in a mouse model 3 . Therefore, TMPRSS2 is likely crucial for SARS-CoV-2 spreading and disease development in vivo, and targeting it either by inhibiting its priming activity or suppressing its expression is likely to be an effective strategy to cure COVID-19.",

It has been reported recently that abnormal coagulation with elevated concentrations of D-dimer, characteristic of DIC with enhanced fibrinolysis, may influence the prognosis of COVID-19 14, 15 . Furthermore, in a murine asthma model, nafamostat mesylate attenuates respiratory inflammation by blocking activation of NF-kB, a critical transcription factor for inflammatory cytokine production 16 . Therefore, nafamostat mesylate is expected to have multiple therapeutic effects. Because nafamostat mesylate has been prescribed in Japan for many years and adequate clinical data regarding safety have accumulated, we suggest that it should be evaluated in COVID-19 patients by itself or in combination with other antiviral drugs that target separate processes needed for virus production.

Given that camostat mesylate-mediated inhibition of TMPRSS2 significantly reduced SARS-CoV-2 infection of primary human airway epithelial cells5 and that blood concentrations of nafamostat mesylate were maintained at 30-240 nM when it was administered intravenously through continuous infusion according to the standard protocol for DIC patients 10 , nafamostat mesylate could be used to treat COVID-19. In contrast, significantly higher doses of nafamostat mesylate are required to block SARS-CoV-2 infection of monkey kidney VeroE6/TMPRSS2 cells as reported previously11 , which is probably due to the significant contribution of the TMPRSS2-independent endocytotic infection pathway. Because a using rats revealed the maximum concentration of intact nafamostat mesylate in the lung after infusion to be about 60-fold higher in comparison with the maximum blood concentration12 , such an accumulation may partially suppress SARS-CoV-2 infection of low-responder cells like VeroE6/TMPRSS2 cells. Therefore, identification and characterization of cells that play a key role in virus spread and disease development is required.Our findings clearly indicate that nafamostat mesylate, the most effective TMPRSS2 inhibitor so far reported, potently inhibits SARS-CoV-2 infection in vitro.Hoffmann et al.    have recently reported that Nafamostat mesylate blocks activation of SARS-CoV-213 .",

The swabs were submitted to the Division of Virology, Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Institute of Medical Science, the University of Tokyo for virus isolation by inoculating with VeroE6 . The research protocol was approved by the Research Ethics Review Committee of the Institute of Medical Science of the University of Tokyo. SARS-CoV-2 viruses were propagated in VeroE6 cells in Opti-MEM I (Invitrogen) containing 0.3% bovine serum albumin (BSA) and 1 \u00b5g of L-1-Tosylamide-2-phenylethyl chloromethyl ketone (TPCK)trypsin/ml at 37 \u00b0C. All experiments with SARS-CoV-2 viruses were performed in enhanced biosafety level 3 (BSL3) containment laboratories at the University of Tokyo, which are approved for such use by the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry, and Fisheries, Japan.SARS-CoV-2 infection assay. Calu-3 (ATCC HTB-55) cells were maintained in MEMcontaining 10% FBS. VeroE6/TMPRSS2 20 (JCRB 1819) cells were propagated in the presence of 1 mg/ml geneticin (G418; Invivogen) and 5 \u00b5g/ml plasmocin prophylactic (Invivogen) in DMEM containing 10% FBS. All cells were incubated at 37 \u00b0C with 5% CO2, and regularly tested for mycoplasma contamination by using PCR and were confirmed to be mycoplasma-free. The target VeroE6/TMPRSS2 or Calu-3 cells were untreated or pretreated with nafamostat mesylate (1-10 5 nM, 4 wells for each dose) for 1 h, and SARS-CoV-2 was then added at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.01 or 0.1. The viruses and cells were incubated for 30 min for viral entry, and the culture medium was changed to fresh medium with the same concentration of nafamostat mesylate. Three or 5 days after infection, EC50 based on the appearance of visually detectable cytopathic effect (CPE).",
