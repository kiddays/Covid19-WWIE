Both coronavirus use the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of their viral spike protein to interact with ACE2. The structural basis of these interactions are already known, forming a dimer of ACE2 with a trimer of the spike protein, opening the door to target them to prevent the infection. Here we present PepI-Cov19 database, a repository of peptides designed to target the interaction between the RDB of SARS-CoV-2 and ACE2 as well as the dimerization of ACE2 monomers. The peptides were modelled using our method PiPreD that uses native elements of the interaction between the targeted protein and cognate partner that are subsequently included in the designed peptides. These peptides recapitulate stretches of residues present in the native interface plus novel and highly diverse conformations that preserve the key interactions on the interface.",

These peptides present a large structural sampling, targeting both the RBD/ACE2 as well as the extracellular ACE2/ACE2 interface. The repository allows for tailored queries and searches and a convenient retrieval of information. Users can visualize the structural model of the proteinpeptide interactively. We believe the information included in PepI-Cov19 database is a significant and worth asset to current efforts devoted to find novel therapeutic agents and strategies to fight SARS-CoV-2. Indeed, the information of protein sequences of potential peptide inhibitors for experimental guidance or structural data of peptides as basis for further computational work represent two of the elements where PepI-Cov19 database can contribute to such efforts. Moreover, the repository will be updated as structural information becomes available on protein complexes related to SARS-CoV-2 cell infection. shown in the repository that allow users to query, search and filter results as well as visualize the three-dimensional structure of protein complex interactively.",
