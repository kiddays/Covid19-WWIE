Our comparison is based on a computerized simulation integrating accumulated SARS-CoV-2 epidemiological knowledge. Our results stress the importance of immediate on-symptom isolation of suspected cases and household members, and the beneficial effects of prompt testing capacity. Our findings expose significant epidemic-suppression differences among strategies with seemingly similar economic cost stressing the importance of not just the portion of population and business that is released, but also the pattern. The most effective building blocks are the ones that integrate several base strategies -they allow to release large portions of the population while still achieving diminishing viral spread. However, it may come with a price on somewhat more complex schemes. For example, our simulations indicate that dividing the population into two groups completely released except for taking turns on a long weekend (Fri-Tue) self-isolation once every two weeks, while protecting the 5% most sensitive population would reduce R below 1 even if ten percent of the population does not follow it. We further simulate the contrasting approach of a stratified population release in a hope to achieve herd immunity, which for the time being seems inferior to other suggested building blocks. Knowing the tradeoff between building blocks could help optimize exit strategies to be more effective and suitable for a particular area or country, while maximizing human life as well as economic value. Given our results, we believe that pandemic can be controlled within a reasonable amount of time and at a reasonable socio-economic burden.",

R t >1 means the disease is spreading at an exponential growth rate as each case causes more than a new single case, and R t <1 means the disease is diminishing as each case causes less than a new single case. The special case of R t =1 or very close to one is not so theoretic, and suggests the disease continues at a fixed rate of new daily cases. In such a case, a short intervention can reduce the number of daily cases and then we can continue with the same measures, but in a lower rate of new daily cases. Reduction of new daily cases could also assist in contact tracing, if done manually -which further slows the epidemic. R t at time zero is called the basic reproduction number R 0 . For SARS-CoV-2 the exact number is under active research and it could change from one country to another or given different environmental conditions 8-10 , with many estimated values in the range of 2.2-3.2 which means each case causes 2.2-3.2 new cases, unless people have already been infected and cannot get infected twice. When social distancing measures are taken, the reproduction rate changes, and it is then denoted by R instead of R 0 .",

The situation is constantly changing and keeping R t <1 but close to 1 is a moving target -for example there are constant changes in human behaviour, public attention and public resilience, weather 11,12 changes, local outbreaks and so on and all could affect R t . We need to dynamically try different measures so we keep R t <1 but close to 1 while probing and estimating the current situation. Therefore, we could occasionally cross the line to R t >1, which means growing infection rates until we take actions to reduce R t . The price paid for social distancing interventions is also in the difficulty of implementing them.

We could be expecting 3-7 sequential multiplications, i.e., 8-128 fold increase (2 3 to 2 7 ) in the number of new infections, and following a similar increase in ICU beds. Therefore, lack of prompt feedback, typically through mass-testing leads to a need to maintain a large spare capacity. Maintaining spare capacity has a large cost associated with it, both monetary and possibly in human life.

Surprisingly, there is a large difference in epidemic-control effectiveness of strategies, while having similar economic costs by releasing the population to a similar extent. The key is not just the portion of the population that is released, but also the release pattern. This finding suggests that exit strategies could be optimized for both viral spread and economic value. The more successful strategies were the more complex ones, integrating several ideas. Gaining understanding of the tradeoff is important as it could assist in building an exit strategy suited for a specific area, in a way that is cost effective and communicable to the public so compliance would be high.

If the symptomatic person self-isolates on symptoms but we wait with household isolation until the virus test for the symptomatic person returns positive, and assuming a 5-day delay we get a much inferior situation with R=1.65. The effect size in this case between an immediate household isolation to a delayed one 1.54/1.65 = 0.93 is comparable to the effect of facial masks with protection factor of 10% 2.83/3.03=0.93, see Figure 2 . These few days post symptoms and before diagnosis could be critical for reducing further infections directly or through other household members 15 . See Figure  1 .

Without fast and prompt testing it would probably not be enough to isolate just the symptomatic person, as research based on experience in China shows that a large proportion of the infections occur within households 13, 16 , see particular example 17 . Patients are pre-symptomatic in the first few days after infection while still being possibly infecting. Furthermore, it's estimated that a vast portion of the infections are made by pre-symptomatic or asymptomatic 18-23 . Social distancing measures taken outside the household, reduces non-household infections. The declining infection rate between households means that relatively, more infection occurs within a household. It is also interesting to notice that areas with larger households are likely to suffer from a higher R even if all other parameters are the same. Our simulations show that a self household isolation, even on the basis of fever alone of one of the members, has a dramatic effect in preventing the spread of the epidemic, and should be used together with any other measures taken 24 . Four options: no isolation, self-isolation of a person upon the first symptom, self isolation of a person upon the first symptom together -household members join after a test returns positive 5 days later, self-isolation of the entire household upon the first symptom.",

Effective contact tracing -Given self-isolated households contain the population with the highest risk of being infected that could have already continued unidentified infection chains, there's importance in locating those that are really infected and trace their contacts to isolate them. When testing is done quickly enough, we have better chances of isolating the non-household individuals that got infected by the detected cases, before they infect others. We note that we did not include contact tracing effects in our simulations, so the total combined effect of isolation and quick testing could be even stronger than we report. 3. Public Compliance and fast reporting -when the logic behind self-household isolation is shared with the public, and the public knows that they would be released in a short time from self-isolation if they didn't contract coronavirus, the public is more likely to comply with the instructions, and with compliance the virus spread would reduce. As symptoms might be mild to begin with, people might delay the request for a test. In the simulations we assume this delay would be half a day on average as we conservatively assumed people would only comply when having fever symptoms, and fever can be tested when entering the workplace, schools, and in a variety of other public places.

For example, a fixed 10% of the population could be released all the time, regardless of the group division. This improvement makes the scheme more real, at the cost of somewhat elevated R -see Figure 4 for 80% business days. As we see, while the cost in terms of R is significant, rising from R=0.98 for Two groups 10-4 days division on personal based group-division, to R=1.03 with additional 10% fixed population release -it's still very close to 1. Even with just the addition of facial masks (or hygiene) at 10% protection it would bring us to R=0.93.

Further groups of increasing risk are then released too, in a measured rate as not to exceed healthcare capacity. The extremely high-risk groups shall be released last once the epidemic is over. Therefore, we release the lowest-risk 25% immediately, and release further 5% of the population every two weeks until ICU is at 1% capacity.

Even for a small country the size of Israel of about 9 million people, it means about 5,400,000 million people need to get infected -and just for Israel. Infecting that many people could result in mistakes being multiplied in very large numbers, and almost definite leakage of infection to more sensitive populations that cannot be really protected in 100% of total isolation for months -resulting in many casualties. 2. Closes the door to potential luck. We might get lucky and have the summer eliminate the epidemic, as happened with some other viral infections -or other measure being successful. We might have an effective medicine that will allow people to get infected without serious consequences. With herd immunity at this point -we won't enjoy this luck, or enjoy it in a limited way. 3. Inefficient, costly for the economy and inhumane, as it will take too long to implement. We take for example Israel which has a relatively young and healthy population structure. It is expected to take many months of quarantine given the limited capacity of the healthcare system, keeping a large portion of the population under quarantine for a prolonged period of time -which can be considered inhumane. We simulate a year ahead, and give the herd immunity approach the advantage that we ignore death after a 1-year period. As can be seen in Figure 3 and Figure 5 , we have other strategies that can, at least potentially, hold the situation with minimal number of infections and casualties for for a relatively low cost, until we have a vaccine for example. 4. Too many will die and die young. While mortality rate is becoming clearer and much lower than initial estimates, it's still relatively high 34 . Herd immunity approach could lead not only to higher mortality than alternatives, but out of the casualties a high proportion would be young. At this time, we don't have medical knowledge that hints that the young people who get to critical condition have some a priori hidden condition that is expected to shorten their life anyhow. So we have to assume at this point that we would be losing many life-years under this strategy. See Figure 5 for distribution of mortality across age groups. 5. Healthcare system strain will kill even more. A herd immunity approach will strain the healthcare systems to its limits for many months. Healthcare personnel and resources will find themself recruited to care for the critical coronavirus patients, inevitably neglecting regular care. Many health situations that would normally end in recovery will end in otherwise avoidable death due to lack of care.",

The more effective building blocks are a combination of both partial planned intermittent quaranties and partial population release, such as a two-group intermittent release. As such, two-group intermittent approaches are better performing, and are reasonable to implement given they can be relaxed to allow some fixed population noncompliance -10 percent in our example -in parallel to the two groups and division into groups can be made on a personal rather than on a household basis. It should be noted, however, that partial release schemes are sensitive to a special division into two groups that does not reduce interaction. For example, the resulting R of dividing the population into two groups on a city basis would resemble the resulting R of a single-group and less the R of two groups. In other words, if the division is not made in a way that shall reduce interaction we will get an R closer to that of a single group.",

Unfortunately, there is just no data available 35 to make a truly informed decision, mostly because schools closed up very quickly globally with the appearance of the pandemic, with the exception of Sweden for the lower age-groups 36 . Children are less symptomatic than adults 37 . Furthermore, there is conflicting information on whether asymptomatic are less infectious 38 than symptomatic. Based on experience in China, Korea and Israel, it seems children contracted the virus less 39 . According to Israeli ministry of health data 40 , the percent of positive tests for children aged 0-9 years old is lower compared to adults and in the range of adults for ages 10-19, suggesting this phenomena of lower contraction in children is not merely an ascertainment bias due to milder symptoms. It could be argued the latter phenomena can be attributed to the fact the main importers of the virus were travelling adults and schools closed up relatively fast. In Sweden, the infection rates of children are also very low 41 -though testing was limited. In household secondary infection in China, children were less likely to get infected 16, 39 . In the municipality of Vo', Italy, almost the entire municipality was tested twice as part of a survey in the early outbreak in Italy 42 . While the infection prevalence was about 2.6%, none of the 234 children aged 0-10 were infected, despite some of them sharing a household with a case. According to Israeli ministry of health information, the education system accounted for only 3-11 percent of virus contraction. On top of things, and perhaps the bottom line -there is no real and reasonable solution for parents to go to work, if their children cannot go to their school -so opening of schools seems unavoidable. Limited mitigation can be partially achieved by noticing symptoms at school, and bi-daily measurements of body temperature for early detection of symptoms, as children tend to be less symptomatic.",

Averaging the numbers in 7 , we assume it reduces droplets and aerosol by about 29.1% to 18.2%, without change in the viral load, i.e., a mask on an affected individual reduces spread by a factor of 0.625 in a period of 30 minutes 7 . Numbers are small so we assume about 30% spread both aerosols and droplets. We cannot make an accurate assumption on how much surgical masks shall reduce infection to a wearer of the mask, though based on 49 it would be about a six-fold protection factor. If we follow these numbers we expect infection to drop by a factor of 0.625/6 to 0.625, i.e., from 0.1 to 0.625. Another cause of inclarity is the possibility that droplets or aerosol are infecting through unprotected eyes, or other transmission from hands to the eyes 50,51 , which are not protected by a surgical mask, and later accidental transfer from hands to mouth or eyes. The inclarity is further extended as good mask usage requires careful fitting of the masks, replacing them frequently enough, smart disposal together with additional protective measures 52 . It's difficult to model long-exposure of several 30 minutes units, as we cannot tell if the percent of droplets are per-person due to mask-face fitting for example (although participants were corrected if they mis-wore the mask), or due to properties of the mask itself. If it's mask properties then an hour worth exposure would still be infecting. e.g., even if we assume the extreme value for mask protection factor of 0.1, then for 5 hours the protection is only 1-(1-0.1) 2x5 =0.651, i.e., the protection is just 30% reduction in possibility of infection. So if surgical masks are useful, it's probably protective for short and random exposure patterns.

Therefore, under complete mix, the number of infectious interactions an infector makes also drops by a factor f , and each infector shall now have only f\uff65\u0278 i d daily infectious interactions.Interestingly, under the complete mix assumption, the probability of a released person to have an infectious interaction with a single infector is identical as in full release. However, there is a factor f less candidates to infect, so the total number of new cases drop by a factor of f . The probability of a released person to have an infectious interaction with an infected person is therefore equal to \u0278 i d /(T-1), where T is the total initial population -and one person is infecting the others. As T>>1 we neglect 1, and remain with infectious interaction probability of \u0278 i d /T.Given there are C infectors released, under the complete mix assumption, the probability of a released person to be infected by one of them is:Using the approximation (1-1/x) x is about e -1 for large x, where x=T/ \u0278 i d , i.e., T>>\u0278 i d , it follows that the probability for a released individual to be infected in a day (if not already infected) is:Our simulation tries to infect released individuals daily based on this probability.Note that when , using the approximation that for small x, the /T \u2211 \u0278 i d \u226a 1 e x = 1 + x probability reduces to . Though this approximation is used in classic analytical /T \u2211 \u0278 i d SIR/SEIR models, we did not have the need to use it in our simulations.We can decompose R 0 to contribution from household infections, and all the rest:R 0 =R HH +R Rest In this case, between day d and d+1: \u0278 i d",
