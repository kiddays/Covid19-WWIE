It is not a simple task to assess the efficiency of current health systems in detecting, treating, and preventing onward transmission of Covid-19, as the number of undetected infections is by definition unknown. Understanding the diffusion and assessing the number of real infections of Covid-19 is crucial for implementing effective public and health policies in tackling the virus. Unfortunately, official reporting and statistics significantly underestimate the true number since there exists a vast proportion of asymptomatic infected patients including those with mild symptoms among all infected individuals who are not detected. Indeed, the infected individuals with low-mild symptoms are likely not going to get in contact with the health care system and will also not be recorded in official statistics.",

Another study discusses that Italy mostly focuses on testing in hospitals with symptoms; hence, the roughly 50% asymptomatic are not covered by this approach [Onder et al.(2020) ]. The same percentage of asymptomatic is also reported in Iceland [Shahan(2020) ]. The asymptomatic individuals in fact can be a direct transmitter of the virus and their unawareness can indirectly strengthen and increase the transmission of Covid-19. Indeed, it seems fair to say that the undetected cases are the major dirver in spreading the disease as detected cases are and will be systematically contained.",

Capture-Recapture (CR) methods are designed to achieve this goal. Our proposal is developed using the cumulative distribution of the observed cases and deaths. The use of CR methods is not straightforward as we are dealing with an open population, subject to deaths, and heterogeneity in the probability of being detected. A data-modified version of Chao's estimator under a geometric distribution is introduced. It accounts for heterogeneity in a simple way and can be easily computed starting from data collected by all government sources. In this way, the policy makers can have benchmark, statistically valid, estimates of the lower bound for the total number of cases and, accordingly, adjust their interventions.",

The results are provided in Table  3 which includes estimates of the hidden and total (observed + hidden) cases with 95% confidence intervals. At the 7th of April the number of infections was 12639 which is the observed number. We have chosen the 15th of March as beginning of the observational period. However other dates are possible as well so that we looked at estimates in dependence of the beginning of the observation period. It can be seen that results change slightly. Of course, if the window is made too small estimates of hidden numbers will only refer to observations made in this window. The major question arises if the es- Table 3 are realistic. For Austria we have an independent study on the size of the Covid19 outbreak (https://www.welt.de/politik/ausland/-article207187759/Coronavirus-Eisberg-hoeher-als-gedacht-Oesterreich-legt-Dunkelziffer--Studie-vor.html). The study was led by Christoph Fassmann and is known as the dark number study. The study was rolled out during the 1 April and 6 April 200 and sampled 1544 persons across Austria covering all ages up to 94 years. According to the study, the proportion of infected people was 0.0033. If this proportion is applied to the population of Austria, as study in media release points out, during the study period there were 28500 infected persons in Austria. The study estimates that we have provided matches very well with the results of the study, independent where we start the observational window. The dark number study also reports a 95% confidence interval for the proportion of infected persons which ranges from 0.0012 to 0.0076, corresponding to 10200 and 67400 infected persons, respectively. Clearly, the capture-recapture estimate is included in this large interval but as we are able to utilize much larger routinely collected data on infected persons the uncertainty provided by the capture-reacpture approach is considerably reduced which is reflected in the relative short confidence intervals.",

Of course, we provide a lower bound, but this information may be treated as a starting point whenever interventions and tools to dampen the spread of the epidemic are rolled out. CR methods are easy to apply in practice, and this is one of the merits of the method. Moreover, we simply use time series of cumulated data, readily available from governments sources. Given that individual data are not publicly available, CR methods provide a straightforward solution to shed light on undetected cases, incorporating heterogeneity that may arise in the probability of being detected simply considering the widely known and used geometric distribution. The example provided here relies on Austrian data, but many other Countries can be analyzed even if there are not benchmark survey studies to compare with. For example, taking data up to 18/04/2020 from https://github.com/opencovid-19/data on several European countries and considering data from the day which we record the first death, we obtain the estimates of undetected cases for Italy, Germany, Spain, UK and Greece (see Table 4 ). The last column in Table  4 shows the ratio of the total estimated cases to the observed cases. There is a remarkable stability around the value of 2.3.",

Confidence intervals for the \"modified\" Chao lower bound have been provided and are seemingly reliable, in particular compared to those presented in other studies. We emphasize that the estimates provided are conservative, in the sense that they provide lower bounds on the size of undetected infections. However, we have provided some evidence such as in the situation of Austria that these lower bound are not far away from the true size of infection in the target population. This needs to be followed up by further comparisons with representative sampling studies on target population infection. This is just a first evidence on the use of capture-recapture methods to study Covid-19 data. Another question is still open: \"is there a way of estimating an upper bound for the number of undetected cases?\". Again capture-recapture methods could be implemented to provide an answer to this question and help policy makers to evaluate the Covid-19 epidemic situation locally and at the 7 All rights reserved.
