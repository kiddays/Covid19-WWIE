Utilizing latest estimates of epidemiological parameters and demographic data, we model the potential effects of various interventions in four representative cities with different population structures -New York, Los Angeles, Daegu and Nairobi. We compared the effects of different interventions in the age-structure populations specific to each city. These policy options are then applied to determine the potential for effective containment.

While the effectiveness of these containment strategies is still emerging, and critical lessons for how long social isolation and testing must remain in place, as well as the need to guard against re-infection demand immediate access to models that can be ground-truthed by comparing model results and the emerging responses to policies already in place in diverse urban settings. For the most hard-hit countries, such as the US, Italy and Spain, there are greater percentages of older population who are facing much higher risks of hospitalization and fatality due to changes of immune system and the impact of preexisting health conditions over time. 1 Studies have found that COVID-19 was an emergent disease of ageing. 2 The effects of population ageing on the outcomes of COVID-19 require much more resources in healthcare services and facilities, which is places a significant burden on the health care infrastructure of many ageing countries. Therefore, countries with high proportion of older population should prioritize strategies that effectively protect older people during the epidemic. The difference in demographic characteristics may call for targeted interventions to suppress the spread of COVID-19. Studies have emphasized the importance of incorporating the demographic information in curbing the spread of the epidemic. 3 An important recent study by the Imperial College COVID-19 Response Team explored the impacts of public health interventions in 11 European countries. 4 Here we focus on individual cities where the policy steps are more homogeneous and can be well-described in the model we present and make available here. Understanding the effects of population ageing on the spread of the epidemic under various containment interventions enables policymakers to make effective decision making to avoid massive hit of the novel coronavirus and relief the pressure on healthcare systems. Important and critically needed modeling studies have explored the effects of different interventions, such as social distancing, school closing and managing dynamics of population movement. [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] Social distancing has been recognized as one of the most effective mitigation strategies. 10,11 An under-studied issue is that of mental health impacts of these strategies across different segments of the population. In addition to social distancing, there are additional opportunities for countries to make transition from stopping the economy. Strategies to get young people back to work and protect older population and epidemiological surveys to track the exposed cases and strict quarantine are implemented well in Korea and Singapore. Strategies tailored to different age groups within the population are in an urgent need to recover the economy.",

As the world's most impacted nation, the number of COVID-19 cases in the United States (US) surged to over half a million by mid-April. 12 New York, the most populous US metropolitan area, was hit the hardest. By contrast, Los Angeles, had a total number of infected cases accounting for fewer than 10% of that in New York. Many factors influence such differences, but the timeline of policy interventions in Los Angeles and New York indicates that New York took actions even faster since the detection of the first case. However, the intervention policy is less detailed and instructive for the public to follow than the one in Los Angeles. Explanations for the rapid increase in the spread of COVID-19 have been proposed. 13, 14 Compared with the containment strategy in the US overall, Korea implemented a faster and effective testing regime, contacttracing, and quarantining of people. Detailed online education and clarification of requirements for isolation where widely disseminated online. In total the South Korean policies greatly increased the quarantine rate of exposed population. Nairobi, as the capital city of Kenya, has a relatively younger population than the other three cities. Kenya also take a fast response since the first case was detected. Four cities all ordered people to keep social distancing, close schools and hand hygiene. While Korea and Kenya called people to wear face masks in the beginning, the US did not encourage people to wear face masks/cloth face covering until April 3, 2020. 15 The difference in the interaction of these non-pharmaceutical interventions and age structures of population might deviate the spread of COVID-19.",

These models are applied to predict the epidemic peaks and sizes of COVID-19 in different intervention scenarios, such as closing schools, working from home, household quarantine and city lockdown. Age-specific studies have reported the role of school children on the spread of COVId-19. Some studies also highlighted the vulnerability of older population with pre-existing conditions.

The age-specific effects of different interventions on the outcomes of COVID-19 Figure 3 presents the temporal evolution of the number of individuals in each wellness/illness category (\"status\") over a year period in the four cities simulated per million residents of initial susceptible population with no intervention. It shows that the COVID-19 outbreak hits the four cities dramatically although differently, mainly due to the variation of population age structures. In the 'no intervention' scenario, COVID-19 causes 550,000 infected cases per million population in Nairobi, which is 35% higher than the reported infected cases in New York, Los Angeles, Daegu. This was mainly due to the higher contact rates among younger population was relative to the older population, which caused higher transmission rates among them. However, the deaths related to COVID-19 were much lower than other three cities with older populations. As seen in Figure 3 , for each million of the susceptible population, COVID-19 caused 29% more deaths in Daegu than in Nairobi, largely due to the older demographics. .

A strategy of 50% of the population working from home only avoided 5% infection in Nairobi and 9%-10% in the other three cities.

A 50% reduction in other mobility helped Nairobi flatten the curve more effectively than the same degree of the working from home strategy. In contrast, a 10% daily quarantine rate averted (Scenario F) 45%-53% of all infections, which was more effective than a strict single social distancing strategy.

S. cities have been under quarantine for less than one month, and already political and social backlash against the strategies is growing in some communities and among some politicians. Under Scenario F and Scenario G, the four cities could be hit by second wave. Therefore, it is critical to maintain the interventions to avoid a second wave of COVID-19, which has now been mildly observed in China. We observe significant variations in the impacts of the different social distancing strategies, while the quarantine strategies (Scenario F and G) show are more uniform effect. With combination of these four interventions, limited age-specific effects were observed in the simulation. A moderate social distancing combined with high quarantine intervention (Scenario G) was effective enough to curb the spread of epidemic in 3 months (Appendix 1).

A similar trend can also be found in the containment effect of infection of the epidemic. By intervening 1-week earlier, Daegu avoids 250 cases of infection, which accounted for 5% of the infection in the business-as-usual (BAU) scenario (policy actions implemented in the real case). We find that Los Angeles and New York could have avoided 43% and 38% of infection if the interventions were introduced 1-week earlier. The earlier intervention strategy also mitigated the overwhelming requirement of hospital beds. Without implementing strict containment strategies, moving intervention earlier could help flatten the curve to certain degree depending on the timing of BAU interventions taking effects.

In our model, we assume the quarantine only happened to people who showed symptoms, whereas, the quarantine strategy could even expand to the exposed but have no symptom yet. Therefore, an expanding quarantine intervention might have even larger effects than the results from our simulations. Since there was no city-specific fatality rates in each city, we adopted the age-specific fatality of China in four cities that was adjusted for censoring demographic information without the consideration of the medical capacity and facility. 1 In addition, other environmental risks, such as air pollution, might have significant impacts on the fatality rate of COVID-19 geographically. 22 A unified agespecific fatality rate might over-or underestimate the estimates of deaths in the four cities. In our model, we did not consider the population dynamics during the pandemic. Next step, we will further incorporate the impacts of population movement and air quality inside the SEIR-HQD model.",

Social distancing might have agespecific effects; therefore, cities with a high proportion of ageing population should reduce their mobility and protect them from younger population who tend to have higher transmission rates. Cities with younger population should be more careful about the second hit, while cities with ageing population should prepare more hospital beds and resources.",
