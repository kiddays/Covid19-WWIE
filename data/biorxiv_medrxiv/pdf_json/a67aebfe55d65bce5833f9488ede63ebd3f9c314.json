            "text": "Although one study revealed the isolation of infectious virus particles from stool samples , to date, it remains unclear how many people shed infectious viruses in feces. Most critically, it remains unknown whether or not there is a possibility for fecal transmission of SARS-CoV-2 but multiple health agencies worldwide have highlighted this possibility. The presence of such a large amount of coronavirus genomes in feces is hardly explainable by a swallowing virus replicating in the throat or by a loss of barrier function of the intestinal epithelium which will allow the release of viruses or genomes from the inside of the body (circulation or lamina propria) to the lumen of the gut. Instead, it is likely due to an active replication in the intestinal epithelium. Recently, intestinal biopsies of SARS-CoV-2 infected patients clearly show the presence of replicating viruses in epithelial cells of the small and large intestine (Xiao et al., 2020) . SARS-CoV-2 infection of the gastrointestinal tract is supported by the fact that ACE2, the virus receptor (Hoffmann et al., 2020) , is expressed in intestinal epithelial cells (Zhao et al., 2020) (Lukassen et al., 2020) (Wu et al., 2020a) (Venkatakrishnan et al., 2020) and single cell sequencing analysis suggest that its expression is even higher on intestinal cells compared to lung cells (Xu et al., 2020a) .This highlights that SARS-CoV-2 is not restricted to the lung but also infects the gastrointestinal tract. Importantly, many animal coronaviruses are well known to be enteric and are transmitted via the fecal-oral route (Wang and Zhang, 2016) .",

Here, we engaged in studying SARS-CoV-2 infection of human intestinal cells. For this, we exploited both human intestinal epithelial cell lines and human organoid culture models to characterize how these cells support SARS-CoV-2 replication and spread and how they respond to viral infection. Direct comparison of both primary and transformed cells show that human intestinal epithelial cells fully support SARS-CoV-2 infection and de-novo production of infectious virus particles. Interestingly, viral infection elicited a robust intrinsic immune response where type III interferon mediated response was shown to be significantly more efficient at controlling SARS-CoV-2 replication and spread as compared to type I interferon.",

            "text": "As there is growing evidence that the gastro-intestinal tract is infected by SARS-CoV-2, we engaged in studying virus infection, replication and spread in human intestinal epithelial cells (IECs). First, SARS-CoV-2 (strain BavPat1) was propagated in the Green monkey cell line Vero (see Methods section). To detect viral infection, we used an antibody directed against a region of the nucleoprotein (NP) which is conserved between of SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2. Additionally, we used the J2 antibody which detects double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) which is a hallmark of RNA virus replication (Targett-Adams et al., 2008) . Cells positive for NP were found to be always positive for dsRNA; the NP signal was found to be dispersed within the cytosolic area whereas dsRNA were found in discrete foci likely corresponding to replication compartments (Harak and Lohmann, 2015) (Fig. S1A ). Supernatants of infected Vero cells were collected at 48 hours post-infection (hpi) and the amount of infectious virus particles present was measured using a TCID50 approach on Vero cells (Fig. S1B ). The colon carcinoma derived lines T84 and Caco-2 cells were then infected with SARS-CoV-2 at a MOI of 0.5 (as determined in Vero cells) and, at different time post-infection, cells were fixed and immunostained using the anti-NP and anti-dsRNA antibodies (Fig. 1A) . Results show that SARS-CoV-2 infected Caco-2 cells were readily detected as early as 4hpi and, by 24 hpi, most of the cells were infected (Fig. 1B) . Similar results were observed in the T84 cells, but detection of infection was slightly delayed compared to Caco-2 cells and, although the same amount of SARS-CoV-2 was used to infect these cells, only around 20% of the cells were found infected at 24 hpi (Fig. 1B) . These observations were in agreement with the increase in viral genome copy numbers over time (Fig. 1C ) and the release of infectious virus particles in the supernatant of infected T84 and Caco-2 cells (Fig. 1D) . Interestingly, infection of IECs by SARS-CoV-2 was associated with the generation of an interferon (IFN)-mediated intrinsic immune response. Concomitant with the differences observed in virus replication and denovo virus production observed between T84 and Caco-2 cells, T84 cells mounted a much stronger immune response compared to Caco-2 cells (Fig. 1E ) although much less T84 cells were infected (Fig. 1B) . All together these results show that IECs are readily infected by SARS-CoV-2 and that infection of Caco-2 cells lead to a weaker intrinsic immune response which is associated with more de-novo infectious virus production compared to T84 cells.",

As quantification of the number of infected cells in 3D organoids is very challenging, we exploited previously established protocols to differentiate and infect human intestinal organoids in two dimensions with viruses (Ettayebi et al., 2016; Stanifer et al., 2020) . Non-differentiated organoids were seeded on human collagen-coated iBIDI chambers. At 24 hrs post-seeding, differentiation was induced by removal of Wnt3a and reducing the amounts of R-spondin and Noggin for four days. Upon full differentiation, organoids were infected with SARS-CoV-2. At 24 hpi, the infection was analyzed by immunostaining using the anti-NP and anti-dsRNA antibodies and by quantitative RT-PCR ( Fig. 4C ). Results show that independent of the donor, colon organoids were readily infected by SARS-CoV-2 as noted by the presence of cells positive for both NP and dsRNA (Fig. 4D ).",

To efficiently combat the pandemic, it is necessary to fully appreciate the complexity of the disease and this requires that the virus life cycle and its interaction with the host are characterized for each site of infection (e.g. lung vs. gut). Here, we report that human Human primary intestinal epithelial cells support robust replication of SARS-CoV-2 and secretion of infectious de-novo virus particles. We found that around 10% of the cells are infected in a human colon derived organoid leading to a modest but significant increase in viral genome copy number (Fig. 4F ) and de-novo infection virus particles (Fig. 4J ) over time.",

It is well known that in vivo intestinal epithelium cells are less immunoresponsive because of the gut microenvironment (e.g. microbiota and tissue specific immune cells) and as such they will very likely show a severely dampened immune response allowing for an even greater SARS-CoV-2 replication.

This is very different to the small intestine where ACE-2 appears to be more expressed (Qi et al., 2020) . This low ACE-2 level could explain why we have a small percentage of infected cells in our colon organoids (Fig. 4E) . On the contrary, TMPRSS2 seems to be not a limiting factor in the colon (Fig. S4C-E) . Interestingly, q-RT-PCR and western blot analysis do not support single cell analysis and clearly show that ACE-2 is expressed in both our carcinoma derived lines and our colon organoids ( Fig. S4F -G). The discrepancy between the single-cell RNA sequencing and classical molecular and biochemical approaches is likely the results of (i) the sequencing being not deep enough to detect ACE-2 in individual cells and (ii) RNA expression not necessarily matching the protein expression levels. These observations highlight that although analyzing data from single-cell RNA sequencing atlases could be very informative, their findings should be validated in tissues as they may be mis-leading or miss important sites of virus replication.",

Interestingly, in a study comparing 13 different human cell lines, Caco-2 cells were the only cell type found to support SARS-CoV-1 replication and, compared to green monkey cells, Caco-2 cells were very efficient in producing infectious de-novo virus particles and did not show cytopathic effects (Mossel et al., 2005) .

            "text": "We propose that the gut is an active site of replication for SARS-CoV-2 and this could account for the viremia observed in COVID-19 patients and for the presence of large amounts of SARS-CoV-2 genomes in the feces. The origin of the replicating SARS-CoV-2 in the intestinal epithelium is still not clear. To date only one paper reported the isolation of infectious virus from stool samples . Further characterization of the SARS-CoV-2 enteric lifecycle is necessary to determine whether the viral infection observed in the gut is due to fecal/oral transmission or is a manifestation of virus spreading from the lung to the gut. In the context of the gut we foresee that at the onset of SARS-CoV-2 infection, human intestinal epithelial cells will mount an antiviral response through the type III IFN signaling pathway. As immune cells participate in mounting an innate immune response, type I IFN will be secreted from these cells and will be able to act on intestinal epithelial cells further reinforcing their antiviral state against SARS-CoV-2. In respect to the severe pathologies observed in the lung, which are believed to be caused by a cytokine storm, the findings that lung epithelial cells mount a muted immune response upon SARS-CoV-2 infection suggests that the cytokines are coming from an alternative source. This source could be from local immune cells but also from the gastro-intestinal mucosa given the large immune response generated by primary human intestinal epithelial cells. As a matter of fact, many cytokines are released from epithelial cells towards the lamina propria (tissue side) (Stanifer et al., 2016) , and will quickly enter the circulation to potentially fuel and promote the inflammation and pathology observed in the lung.",

This decrease of the number of SARS-CoV-2 infected cells pre-treated with either IFNs was associated with an inhibition of the increase in viral genome copy numbers(Fig. 2C)and with a significant decrease in the release of infectious de-novo virus particles(Fig. 2D). These results show that both IFNb1 and IFNl provided in trans can induce an efficient antiviral state in IECs preventing/controlling SARS-CoV-2 infection. This strongly suggests that the IFN-mediated immune response can control SARS-CoV-2 infection in human IECs.",

Interestingly, infection of human primary intestinal epithelial cells by SARS-CoV-2 induces a robust intrinsic immune response characterized by the production of type III IFNs but not type I IFN. Pre-treatment of intestinal epithelial cells with exogenous IFNs prior to SARS-CoV-2 infection results in a major drop of the number of infected cells, a reduction of viral replication and a significant decrease in the production of infectious de-novo virus particles. Concomitantly, inhibition of type III IFN signaling by genetic ablation of its specific receptor results in a significant increase of SARS-CoV-2 replication and secretion. Together our results demonstrate that human intestinal epithelial cells are a productive site of SARS-CoV-2 replication and this may have critical implications for the etiology of both SARS-CoV-2 infection and for the pathologies observed in COVID-19 patients. Additionally, our work highlights the central role of type III IFN in controlling SARS-CoV-2 at the intestinal epithelium.",

The reason for the difference in the amount of IFN made upon infection of lung vs. intestinal epithelial cells is currently unclear. Like intestinal epithelial cells(Pervolaraki et al., 2017(Pervolaraki et al., , 2018Pott et al., 2011), lung epithelial cells are normally highly immunoresponsive and make IFNs upon viral infection(Crotta et al., 2013; Ye et al., 2019). The lack of IFN in lung epithelial cells following SARS-CoV-2 infection might be specific for this virus in this tissue(Blanco-Melo et al., 2020) as SARS-CoV-1 induces IFN production in infected lung tissue(Chu et al.). These differences should be properly addressed in future studies.",
