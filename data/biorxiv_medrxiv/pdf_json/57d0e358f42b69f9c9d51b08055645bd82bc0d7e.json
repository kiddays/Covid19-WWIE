            "text": "In vertebrates, bone formation is dynamically controlled by the activity of two specialized cell types: the bone-generating osteoblasts and bone-degrading osteoclasts. Osteoblasts produce the soluble receptor activator of NFkB ligand (RANKL) that binds to its receptor RANK on the surface of osteoclast precursor cells to promote osteoclastogenesis, a process that involves cell-cell fusion and assembly of molecular machinery to ultimately degrade the bone. CD13 is a transmembrane aminopeptidase that is highly expressed in cells of myeloid lineage has been shown to regulate dynamin-dependent receptor endocytosis and recycling and is a necessary component of actin cytoskeletal organization. In the present study, we show that CD13-deficient mice display a normal distribution of osteoclast progenitor populations in the bone marrow, but present a low bone density phenotype. Further, the endosteal bone formation rate is similar between genotypes, indicating a defect in osteoclast-specific function in vivo. Loss of CD13 led to exaggerated in vitro osteoclastogenesis as indicated by significantly enhanced fusion of bone marrow-derived multinucleated osteoclasts in the presence of M-CSF and RANKL, resulting in abnormally large cells with remarkably high numbers of nuclei with a concomitant increase in bone resorption activity. Similarly, we also observed increased formation of multinucleated giant cells (MGC) in CD13 KO bone marrow progenitor cells stimulated with IL-4 and IL-13, suggesting that CD13 may regulate cell-cell fusion events via a common pathway, independent of RANKL signaling. Mechanistically, while expression levels of the fusion-regulatory proteins dynamin and DC-STAMP are normally downregulated as fusion progresses in fusion-competent mononucleated progenitor cells, in the absence of CD13 they are uniformly sustained at high levels, even in mature multi-nucleated osteoclasts. Taken together, we conclude that CD13 may regulate cell-cell fusion by controlling expression and localization of key fusion proteins that are critical for both osteoclast and MGC fusion.",

            "text": "Loss of osteoclast (OC) generation/function gives rise to elevated bone formation without remodeling, resulting in osteopetrosis characterized by high bone mass and growth impairment, while gain of OC generation/function results in exacerbated bone degradation that, without equivalent coupling to bone formation, leads to osteoporosis, characterized by low bone mass, bone weakness and high predisposition to fractures with poor healing progression. OCs form from committed monocyte progenitors via initial signals provided by two central bone marrow-derived cytokines: macrophage colony stimulating factor (M-CSF) and receptor activator of NFkB ligand (RANKL), initiating a highly-organized program of commitment towards terminal differentiation and function [6] [7] [8] . This process involves proteins that participate in cell-cell fusion which are critical to the generation of functionally active OCs. Despite our current knowledge of events leading to the formation of OCs, understanding the regulation of these processes in homeostatic as well as their de-regulation in pathological conditions is unclear [9] [10] [11] . CD13 is a transmembrane metalloprotease widely expressed in all cells of the myeloid lineage, as well as activated endothelial cells, hematopoietic progenitor and stem cells [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] . Previous studies have implicated CD13 in vasculogenesis, tumor cell invasion, inflammatory trafficking and as a receptor for human corona virus [17] [18] [19] . Our novel observations have clearly shown that independent of its peptidase activity, CD13 is a critical molecule that assembles the molecular machinery enabling diverse cellular processes such as cell-cell adhesion, migration, membrane organization and dynamin-mediated receptor endocytosis and recycling of cell surface proteins 14, 15, [20] [21] [22] . Taken together, CD13 regulates many of the activities that have been described to be critical for osteoclastogenesis and cell-cell fusion. In the current study, we demonstrate that despite a relatively normal distribution of hematopoietic components in bone marrow and periphery, CD13 KO mice have reduced bone mass with increased OC numbers per bone surface area but normal bone formation parameters, indicating that osteoclastogenesis is compromised in the absence of CD13. In addition, the in vitro induction of CD13-deficient myeloid progenitors generated from bone marrow and spleen resulted in increased numbers of OCs that were considerably larger in size, contained many more nuclei and resorbed bone more efficiently than those from wild type progenitors. We confirmed that CD13-deficient macrophages can also hyperfuse to generate elevated multinucleated giant cells (MGCs) which again, were larger and contained more nuclei than those generated from wild type macrophages, suggesting that CD13 is a component of common fusion pathways shared by OC and MGC. Furthermore, we demonstrated that expression of fusion proteins which is typically downregulated in mature osteoclasts post-fusion 23 is abnormally preserved in osteoclasts lacking CD13. These findings are in agreement with our data showing that CD13 is a mediator of homotypic cell interaction and a regulator of molecular events defining cell membrane organization, fluidity and movement, all processes critical to cell-cell fusion 14, 15, 20 .

These studies prompted our current focus on the myeloid cells of the bone, the osteoclasts. We initially examined the effect of a global loss of CD13 on the phenotype of developing bone. Analysis of bone micro-architecture and function in the cortical and trabecular bone isolated from 8-10 wks. old WT and CD13 KO male mice by \u00b5-CT and histomorphometric analysis revealed that the femur cortical and trabecular bone density and thickness in CD13 KO mice is significantly reduced (1.5 fold) compared to WT animals (FIG. 1A, B) . Previously we have shown that the distribution of the hematopoietic population comprised of early hematopoietic progenitors, myelo-erythroid progenitors, common myeloid progenitors, and granulocyte macrophage progenitors in CD13 KO mice were similar to wildtype animals 12 . Cells that can generate bone-resorbing osteoclast reside in both bone marrow and peripheral hematopoietic organs 24 . To determine if differences in osteoclast progenitor (OCP) frequency are responsible for the loss of bone mass in the absence of CD13, we analyzed the distribution of primary OCP in both the bone marrow microenvironment and spleen in WT and CD13 KO mice.",

This difference was evident by d3, suggesting that the lack of CD13 accelerates OC fusion and multinucleation but not OCP proliferation rates, as the cell density (total number of nuclei/dish) was not significantly different between genotypes (FIG. 3G) . Furthermore, we examined the flow sorted spleen-derived OCP (CD3-B220-NK1.1-CD11b+ Ly6G-Ly6C+ CD115+), which were allowed to proliferate in presence of M-CSF for d3, followed by differentiation into mature OCs by RANKL treatment for an additional 3 days. Similar to BM-derived cells, CD13 KO -derived splenic cells produced OCs with larger area (3-fold), more cells with >3 nuclei (2.5-fold) and an increased number of nuclei per cell (3-fold) compared to WT mice (FIG. 4A-D) . To assess OC bone resorptive capacity, we plated WT and CD13 KO flow-sorted bone marrow-derived OCP on Osteo assay plates (Corning) in the presence of recombinant M-CSF and RANKL and allowed them to mature to OC over time.",

            "text": "Pertinent to our observations, it is believed that since OCs and macrophages are derived from common progenitors, some of the molecular mechanisms mediating their fusion and multinucleation may be shared 28 . In particular, the small GTPase dynamin 2 (the major isoform in OC) and the fusion protein DC-STAMP are common and critical regulators of both osteoclast and MGC fusion 23, 27 . Our recent studies have shown that CD13 is a potent negative regulator of dynamin-dependent endocytosis of a variety of receptors [20] [21] [22] , suggesting that CD13 may participate in cell fusion by regulating endocytic processes. Indeed, immunofluorescence analyses of WT BM-OCPs differentiated to OC with M-CSF and RANKL demonstrated high levels of dynamin and DC-STAMP expression by d2-post differentiation, which was subsequently reduced by 4d, when cell fusion and maturation into multinucleated WT osteoclasts is complete, as previously reported 23 . However, while dynamin and DC-STAMP are highly expressed in CD13 KO OCP, rather than being downregulated, this strong expression is maintained in mature multinucleated OCs (FIG. 6) , suggesting that CD13 may impact fusion by regulating the levels of key fusion and/or endocytic molecules critical for OC and MGC fusion. Further investigation into the relationship between CD13 and these and other common regulators of myeloid cell fusion such as OC-STAMP, the macrophage fusion receptor, osteoclast receptor avb3 integrin 28 will clarify common mechanisms regulating CD13-dependent myeloid cell fusion as well as the fusion of other lineages including satellite stem cells.",

Immunofluorescence and confocal microscopy further confirmed CD13 expression in CD68+ MGC(FIG. 5E).

Thus, this important biological process directly defines the course of many pathological processes including infertility, skeletal defects (osteoporosis and osteopetrosis), failure of skeletal repair, failure of maintenance of prosthetic implants as well as fusion of host plasma membrane and virus fusion protein in viral diseases. Clearly, potential common regulators and mechanisms would be attractive therapeutic targets in these disorders. Two of the cell types that undergo fusion, osteoclasts and multinucleated giant cells, are derived from a common progenitor from bone marrow and periphery. These cells are rendered fusion competent by common molecular mediators and ultimately mediate specialized functions in specific microenvironments. While OC can undergo fusion in both normal or pathological states such as Paget disease 32 , macrophages undergo fusion to form MGC primarily under inflammatory conditions such as chronic granulomatous disease 33 . However, the fact that the fusion of OC andMGCs are governed by common signaling mechanisms again makes these and their component molecules attractive targets for therapeutic intervention. Interestingly, we have previously shown that in response to ischemic injury, CD13 KO skeletal muscle satellite cells fused more readily than WT cells to form multinucleated myoblasts, suggesting that CD13 may also participate in fusion of other cell types, thus affecting processes such as skeletal muscle repair16 .",

Our data showing an aberrant persistence of fusion protein expression post-fusion in CD13 KO OCs suggests that CD13 may regulate the expression of these endocytic and fusion proteins during fusion, perhaps by mediating their internalization, endocytic trafficking, recycling and/or localization. In addition, organizers of actin-based protrusions are pivotal in both osteoclast and macrophage fusion. Recently, we have reported that CD13 is a critical signaling platform that links the plasma membrane to dynamic mediators of actin cytoskeletal assembly and rearrangement 20 . It remains to be established if CD13 localization is required at the site of cell-cell fusion to enable cells to be fusion competent and that its expression on both cells is imperative for fusion.",
