The pooling of the negative sample will reduce kit consumption without affecting the outcome. The possibility of mixing the positive specimen with the negative may result and it would affect the true results. The one possibility is that the positive result may become negative due to the dilution with the negative specimen. The PCR can detect the small number of pathogens and the specimen from positive patient usually contains a large number of viral particles, so the possibility of the positive specimen is to become negative by mixing with the negative specimen is very remote. The studies revealed that there is no significant effect of the pooling of negative specimens with the positive specimen in terms of the detection of the positive test by PCR methods [6] . Another study showed that the positive specimen may be detected even when it is diluted with up to 64 specimens [7] .",

As the availability of test kits for SARS-CoV-2 are limited, the possibility of pool sample testing may be adapted to overcome the shortage of kit reagents. In the pool testing, the multiple specimens from different suspected cases are combined to perform them in a single test process, and this method is helpful in the improvement of a screening program for the community screening [9] [10] . The important thing is pool sample testing is the number of tests to be included in the sample pool. If this number is not optimum, then there may be more utilization of test reagents and it would enhance the wastage of resources and efforts. The determination of an optimum number of specimens for the pooled sample testing is determined by the application of algorithms as discussed in the results. This application determines the optimum number of tests to be pooled for a single test and it will depend upon the total positive rate of COVID-19 cases in that particular community.",

Until now, there is no proven effective medicine against the COVID-19. The best solution is to adopt preventive measures to limit the spread of infection among the people. One of the important measures is to identify infected cases and isolate them from healthy people. In this regard, screening of the samples from a large number of people is required.
