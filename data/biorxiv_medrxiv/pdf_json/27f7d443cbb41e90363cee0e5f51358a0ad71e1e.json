The huge influx of Covid-19 patients into hospitals in affected countries has led to disruption of usual clinical activity, with cancellation of elective in-patient and outpatient activity. [3] [4] [5] In many cases, normal ambulatory care has been replaced by remote management using a variety of telemedicine approaches. 6 Even non-Covid-19 related emergency department activity has decreased markedly in many countries, as reported in a previous Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome outbreak. 7,8 As a result, there is concern that deaths from non-Covid-19 causes could increase, due to reduced routine care. One way to address these two questions is to examine recent observed population-based mortality rates, compared with expected rates, and compare any excess in deaths with the number of deaths attributed to Covid-19. We have analysed these data for 4 countries which have provided such data on a routine basis for at least 5 years.",

The increase in mortality is not wholly explained by deaths attributed to Covid-19. Indeed, only between 49 and 73% of the excess in deaths can be explained by official Covid-19 reports. The data from New York state support these findings, with an even more striking picture in New York city. The two most likely explanations for the discrepancy between the overall excess of deaths and the extra deaths not explained by Covid-19 are either there are additional deaths caused (or contributed to) by Covid-19, but not recognised as such, or that there is an increase in deaths from non-Covid-19 causes, potentially resulting from diminished routine diagnosis and treatment of other conditions. We believe that both are likely. In many reports of mortality attributed to Covid-19, the focus has been on deaths occurring in hospital. Similarly, in some countries due to limited testing for SARS-Cov-2 infection, deaths among elderly people in care homes and other places potentially caused (or contributed to) by Covid-19 are not attributed to that condition. 13 Interestingly, in England and Wales, where data were available by age category, the proportion of excess deaths attributed to Covid-19 was smallest in the oldest age group, possibly because more frequent underlying comorbidity made the cause less certain in those individuals or made it easier to ascribe an alternative cause of death.",

Even return to use of thrombolysis has been mooted. 15 The same considerations apply to acute stroke. 16 There has also been concern about re-supply of essential medicines to patients and even the impact of public discussion of the safety ACE inhibitors and ARBs which are life-saving treatments in patients with heart failure and reduced ejection fraction and in high-risk survivors of myocardial infarction. 17 Similar concerns have also been raised about patients with cancer, chronic kidney disease and diabetes, for obvious reasons. 18-20 All of these are diseases of older age and therefore it is unsurprising that we found that only the youngest individuals were not affected by this excess. If not already, in due course, mental health problems and domestic violence may also add to the non-Covid-19 excess in mortality, although reduction in industrial deaths, fatal road traffic accidents and deaths related to air pollution may offset increases from these other causes. 21, 22 This may also explain why we have not observed an excess of non-Covid-19 deaths in those <45 years where deaths due to causes other than ischaemic heart disease or cancer represent a greater proportion of deaths.",

It would have been of interest to include Italy and Spain in these analyses. Data on overall mortality were available for some regions in Italy: in the North, most affected by the pandemic, there was a 65% increase in the numbers of deaths observed, compared to expected, in the period from the time of the first reported Covid-19 case to the beginning of April. 23 Similar data for Central and Southern regions, areas less affected by the pandemic, showed a 10% increase in the observed number of deaths, compared to expected. We could not obtain Spanish national data for the dates of our analysis in the other countries and Spain is also in a different phase of its Covid-19 outbreak. However, Spanish data for the period 17 March to 20 April 2020, spanning the peak weeks of the pandemic in that country, show a substantial increase in the number of deaths observed, compared to expected. 24 Unlike the other countries we studied, most of the excess mortality was attributed to Covid-19.

Few countries currently report mortality data quickly enough to allow identification of the excess in deaths we have highlighted. Rapid reporting of deaths should not be difficult and is essential to identify a problem like this, early, and the impact of efforts to diminish it.",

            "text": "death and attribution of cause in Spain, compared with the UK and Netherlands.Comparison with other nations is further complicated by variations in the trajectory of the pandemic in individual countries. For example, in Denmark, a north European country, similar to the others we studied, and with a national health service, the epidemiology of the pandemic has been very different. With a total of 6511 cases in a population of 5.8 million, only 299 COVID-19 related deaths have been reported from as of 14 April 2020. However, there may be more of a delay in reporting deaths in Denmark than in the other countries. Population density and transport links are also likely to be important as illustrated here by the comparison between New York state and city and the reports from many countries of worse outbreaks in large urban areas and cities with busy international airports.Clearly it will take time to fully explain the trends we have described and, especially, to quantify the exact causes of the excess of non-Covid-19 deaths. Even then it may be difficult to accurately determine whether Covid-19 caused or contributed to death. In patients requiring mechanical ventilation for Covid-19 induced respiratory failure it may be appropriate to attribute cause of death to Covid-19 but other patients may have the cause attributed to Covid19 while dying from worsening heart failure or unidentified pulmonary thromboembolism. If it is correct that the Covid-19 pandemic has had a detrimental effect on medical care more generally, other \"downstream\" consequences are likely. Non-Covid-19 hospital admissions may rebound as chronic conditions destabilise. Failure to diagnosis and treat new events may have other delayed consequences, for example the development of heart failure in sub-optimally treated or untreated acute myocardial infarction and stroke in patients with untreated transient ischaemic attack.",

The coding and therefore definition of a Covid-19 related death may be influenced by local regulations and guidelines on certifying the cause of death in each country, as discussed in relation to Spain above. Finally, the availability of testing for Covid-19 may have influenced the ascertainment of Covid-19 related deaths in each country and therefore the excess of non-Covid-19 deaths in each of the countries may represent an under-identification of cases of SARS-Cov-2 infection. Conversely, the number of Covid-19 deaths may be inflated by deaths in people who had Covid-19 at the time of death but did not die from their viral illness i.e. died from another non-Covid-19 reason despite infection with SARS-Cov-2.",

The first case of Covid-19 was reported in New York State 1 March and the first death 14 March 2020.As this analysis utilised publicly available national statistics, no ethical approval was required.
