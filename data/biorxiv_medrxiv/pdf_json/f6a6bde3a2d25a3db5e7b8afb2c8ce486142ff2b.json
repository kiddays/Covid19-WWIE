Methods were compared on a series of all COVID-19 consecutive cases (n=59) admitted in an ICU devoted to such patients. At the last follow-up date, 99 days after the first admission, all patients but one had been discharged. A simulation study investigated the generalizability of the methods' patterns. CPE and DPE estimates were also compared to COVID-19 estimates reported to date. Findings: LOS \u2265 30 days concerned 14 out of the 59 patients (24%), including 8 of the 21 deaths observed. Two months after the first admission, 38 (64%) patients had been discharged, with corresponding DPE and CPE estimates of ICU_ALOS (95%CI) at 13.0 days (10.4-15.6) and 23.1 days (18.1-29.7), respectively.

A major aim of these measures is lessening as much as possible the daily number of new individuals requiring an admission in intensive care units (ICU) in order to be able to appropriately manage them in the healthcare system and sustain an appropriate management for the rest of the population. 2 A fast inflow of new admissions in the ICU has critical consequences within a short time. For example, between March 19 and April 2 2020 in France, the number of ICU beds occupied by COVID-19 infected persons dramatically increased from 1002 to 6305, 3 corresponding to an average daily increase of 14 % additional beds. Such a situation requires a massive and rapid increase of ICU facilities and the French Minister of Health announced on March 28 that the nationwide capacity had been increased from 5000 to 10,000 critical beds. 4 The underlying mathematics are simple: an average unbalanced increase of 15% during 14 days implies that at day 14, the resulting occupancy would be that of day 0 multiplied by a factor 7.08 since 1.15 (14 days ) = 7.08. The system is highly sensitive to a sustained unbalance: even an average increase as low as 2% during two weeks, a likely situation after outbreak peak, would nevertheless require increasing occupancy at day 14 by 32%.",

Such an estimate is expected to be provided as soon as possible. However, when examining the situation within a short delay after the beginning of the outbreak, only few cases are likely to be already discharged from the ICU. The patients still in ICU referred to as censored cases must be considered in any unbiased estimation relating to the length of stay (LOS). In this study, we present a detailed examination of the timeline of the whole cohort of consecutive COVID-19 patients admitted to a devoted ICU of the Zhongnan hospital of Wuhan University (ZHWU) in which we investigated the evolution of the ALOS estimation according to the accumulation of the cases, using two methods of estimation. Our results indicate that even considering a last follow-up date corresponding to the date when two thirds of the admitted patients would have been discharged, the ICU ALOS estimated with the biased method would be nearly half of that issued from the unbiased method. At the light of these investigations, the estimates relating to ICU LOS of COVID-19 cases that have been reported to date 5-8 likely underestimate the real values. Such estimates being also used in forecasting models, [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] the present study has practical implications for improving prediction scenarios to guide public decision.

These concerns may be then extended to modelling studies 9,10,12,13,17 that will naturally parameterize their forecasts according to the observational data reported (Table S2 in the Supplementary Appendix 2). The data of the series reported here yielded an estimate of ICU ALOS at 21.1 days (95% CI 17.5-25.3) and a median ICU LOS at 17.4 days [IQR 9.6-28.7]. These estimates are well above estimates reported to date. These estimates are associated with several strengths. First the whole study time course lasted 99 days, enough time had passed for allowing a last date of follow-up at which all patients but one were discharged. To our knowledge, such a resulting quasi complete distribution of the LOS observed in a given series of COVID-19 cases (see Figure 2B ) has not been reported to date, and in addition, such a data set is indeed appropriate for assessing estimation methods since the target value of the estimate is nearly perfectly known (only one stay remained censored).",

Therefore, enhancing the quality of the above-mentioned estimates is an important concern and our study suggests that there is room for such enhancements in the analyses of COVID-19 epidemic. Third and to conclude, whenever the estimates reported in this study would be generalizable to other settings, then this is bad news: long ICU LOS as reported here imply that occupied beds remain unavailable for a long time and this adds additional pressure to the surge in ICU beds encountered in many places worldwide.",

First, on December 30 2019, at a time when the outbreak emerged frankly, two initial ICU, one depending on emergency and the other from surgery, were reorganized for constituting a single entity of 31 beds devoted to the management of patients with COVID-19 requiring critical care. Second, on March 12 2020, at a time when the outbreak had declined, all COVID-19 ICU patients were transferred to another ICU in Leishenshan hospital, the largest newly-built facility for COVID-19 patients with 1,600 beds, while ICU admissions were reorganized for other pathologies than COVID-19 at ZHWU. Third, on April 15, Leishenshan hospital was definitively closed and patients initially admitted at ZHWU were retransferred to this hospital.",

On March 8, two months after the first admission date later, 38 (64%) patients had been discharged and the estimate of ALOS issued from DPE and CPE at that date was 13.0 days (95% CI 10.4-15.6) and 23.1 days (95% CI 18.1-29.7), respectively. Under the assumption that the parametric distribution used in CPE is well fitted to the data, the two methods should converge towards a similar estimate when no censoring data remain, i.e., when all patients of the cohort have been discharged: while only one patient remained in the ICU at the last date of follow-up, April 16, ALOS with CPE and DPE was 21.1 days (95% CI 17.5-25.3) (which constitutes the most accurate estimate on the study data set) and 20.2 days (95% CI 16.2-24.3), respectively. CPE estimate of hospital ALOS 30.6 days (95% CI 26.2-35.3) and median duration of hospital LOS was 27.0 days [IQR 16.5-39.0]",
