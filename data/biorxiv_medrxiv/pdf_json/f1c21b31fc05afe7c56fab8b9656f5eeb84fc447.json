These events define five major clades (G, I, S, 26 D and V) of globally-circulating viral populations, representing 85.7% of all sequenced 27 cases, which we can identify using a 10 nucleotide genetic classifier or barcode. We applied 28 this barcode to 4,000 additional genomes deposited between March 31 st and April 15 th and 29 classified successfully 95.6% of the clades demonstrating the utility of this approach. An 30 analysis of amino acid variation in SARS-CoV-2 ORFs provided evidence of substitution 31 events in the viral proteins involved in both host-entry and genome replication. The 32 systematic monitoring of dynamic changes in the SARS-CoV-2 genomes of circulating 33 virus populations over time can guide therapeutic and prophylactic strategies to manage 34 and contain the virus and, also, with available efficacious antivirals and vaccines, aid in the 35 monitoring of circulating genetic diversity as we proceed towards elimination of the agent. 36",

We found the V483A substitution in 13 closely-related cases 163 from Washington State.

V367 is 512 surface exposed, and its substitution would not create clashes with other protein regions. However, the exchange of a small with a bulky 513 hydrophobic residue would alter the surface characteristics of this region, which might influence the efficiency of glycosylation (stick 514 model) of the nearby N343, or the positioning of the sugars. Additionally, the altered RBD surface could potentially interfere with 515 antibody recognition. (D) G476S: G476 is located in the RBD. It is positioned solvent-exposed in a SARS-CoV-2-specific loop. This 516 loop is stabilised by a disulphate bridge (C480:C488; C480 is shown as stick model). In the open, ACE2-bound conformation of the 517 RBD, G476 is close to ACE2 Q24 and E23. The substitution G476S would lead to light clashes with these ACE2 residues (indicated as 518 red spheres) and with the RBD residues N487. However, minor reorientation of the side chains might allow an additional hydrogen bond 519 to be formed between S476 and ACE2 Q24 and E23, thus enhancing the affinity. (E) V483A: V483 is also located in the RBD, solvent-520 exposed in the same SARS-CoV-2-specific loop as G476 (C480:C488 are shown as stick models). In the open, ACE2-bound 521 conformation of the RBD, V483 is more than 10\u00c5 away from the ACE2 receptor, and hence does not contribute to direct binding or 522 stability. In the closed conformation, this loop is not modeled in the EM structures (PDB 6vyb), inferring it is flexible in the absence of ACE2. Superimposition of the ACE2-bound conformation of the RBD onto RBDs in a closed conformation shows that this loop region 524 would stick out into the solvent. Substitution of V483 is consequently not predicted to have a strong impact on receptor binding or 525 protein stability. By lowering the hydrophobic surface, this substitution might however reduce the non-specific stickiness of this loop 526 region, and/or affect binding of antibodies. (F) D614G: D614 is located in the SD1. In the trimeric S, D612 engages stabilising 527 interactions within the SD1 (R646 or the backbone of F592, depending on the chain) and with the S1 of the adjacent chain (T859 and 528 K854). Replacement of D614 with a glycine would entail losing these stabilising interactions and increase the dynamics in this region. 529 (G) V1040F: V1040 is located in a loop region that makes hydrophobic contacts between stalk regions of the spike trimer. The V1040F 530 substitution is possible without steric hindrance, and would slightly increase the hydrophobic contacts between the chains. The other 531 mutations are not shown in detail, but are evaluated as follows. M153T: M153 is located in the NTD in a solvent-exposed loop. N 532 electron density was modeled for this loop in the cryo-EM structure (6vyb) suggesting it is flexible. The substitution is expected to be 533 neutral. S940F: S940 is located in the stalk region, in a solvent-exposed turn. Introducing the bulkier phenylalanine in this position 534 would not destabilise the structure but locally change the surface characteristics. C1254F: C1254 is the last cysteine in a cysteine-rich 535 unstructured short cytoplasmic region. This region is required for efficient membrane fusion. The exact mechanism remains to be 536 elucidated, and hence we cannot assess the exact impact of the C1254F mutation.",

The nonsynonymous mutations in the N 183 protein, which have key roles in viral assembly, might also have functional implications. 184 The hotspot mutations S202N, R203K and G204R all cluster in a linker region where they 185 might potentially enhance RNA binding and alter the response to serine phosphorylation 186 events (Supplementary Figure 6). The clade I-defining mutation in the nucleocapsid 187 protein, which has key roles in viral assembly, is synonymous. However, we observed 188 nonsynonymous mutations in the nucleocapsid protein that are predicted to have functional 189 implications.

The clustering of these 197 genomes revealed the spread of clades to diverse geographical regions (Figure 1, Figure 3). 198 This pattern contrasts with those observed for other epidemic coronaviruses, such as 199 MERS-CoV, which display distinct geographical clustering 17 . For example, clade G, which 200 was first detected on January 28 th , has reached 40 countries and 130 cities, within a span 201 of 10 weeks (Supplementary Table 1). This pattern demonstrates efficient viral 202 transmission through frequent intercontinental travel during the period when international 203 social distancing in order to contain the global spread of viruses. 207 208 We have observed a distinct distribution of the major clades in different parts of the 209 world (Figure 3). Most of the viral genomes that have not been assigned to a major clade 210 are found in Asia and have earlier detection times in January and February at the start of 211 the epidemic in China (Supplementary Figure 2). We observed a decrease in the genetic 212 diversity of the virus over time following dissemination from China, especially in Europe 213",

Both domains 543 are flanked by flexible regions, namely a flexible linker between them (LKR, underlined 544 in the bottom panel sequence) and ~40 residue intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) as 545 tails. The NTD and CTD are RNA-binding regions, but the LKR and IDRs also affect 546 RNA-binding of N 2 . The LKR contains a serine-arginine (SR)-rich region, which 547 contributes to RNA binding and N oligomerization. The arginines may promote RNA-548 binding through electrostatic interactions, whereas the serines are putative phosphorylation 549 sites that would counteract RNA binding and possibly favour oligomerisation upon 550 phosphorylation 3 . The hotspot mutations S202N, R203K and G204R are all within the SR 551 region of the LKR. S202N would delete a putative phosphorylation site. Given the large 552 number of alternative serine phosphorylation sites, and the presence of many asparagines 553 within the linker, this S/N substitution might not have a very strong influence. The 554 homologous substitution R203K is also expected to have only minor effects. G204R might 555 increase binding to RNA, and/or affect other homo-or heterologous interactions. In 556 summary, the substitutions might potentially enhance RNA binding and alter the response 557 to serine phosphorylation events. The structural figure consists of homology models for 558 the NTD and CTD, linked by arbitrary but stereochemically-plausible linker regions.
