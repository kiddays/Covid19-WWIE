The approach has been tested by predicting the number of contaminated persons until 20 days after fitting the inputs data collected within 15 days using standard least \u03c7 2 -fit method. Encouraged by this first test, we add the new data collected within 30 days and give prevision until 33 days. The present data show an approximate linear increase of about (4-5) infected persons per day while the analysis signals an eventual near future stronger growth. These results may also be interpreted as the lowest values of the real cases due to the insufficient number of samples (about 2200 for 20 millions of population). A comparison with some other approaches is done. Some social, economical and political impacts of COVID-19 and confinement for Madagascar and Worldwide are shortly discussed.",

Didier Raoult -Marseille (expert in tropical diseases), which were successful against paludism are promising though under debates. Some other pists are the uses of some endemic medicinal plants such as in Madagascar where some of them contains natural chloroquine. 3 There is some proposal from the Bill Gates foundation but doing the first tests in Africa are criticized. 4 However, new study (French TV source) recommends a distance above 2m. 5 The true lifetime of the virus on inert objects is still under study and needs to be confirmed. ing in China, Europe, UK, USA and Russia have been done in different works (see e.g. various new articles in arXiv [7]) where most of them are based on Susceptible-Infected (SI) or Susceptible-Infected Recovered (SRI) models (see e.g. [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] ) while some is a simple Gaussian fit of the data [19] . To our knowledge nothing has been yet done in African and some other developing countries. The reasons could be that, in these developing countries, the pandemic is still at the beginning of its effect and the data are not yet sufficient to make a rigourous statistical study (Gaussian law of large numbers of events) which is also complemented by the eventual non-reliability of the collected data due to the few numbers of detection tests or perhaps for some political reasons. 2. First analysis : data up to 15 days COVID-19 enters in Madagascar on 21th March through the Antananarivo-Ivato airport via passengers from Europe and from China.
