Here the X-ray crystal structure of M pro in complex with Carmofur reveals that 25 the carbonyl reactive group of Carmofur is covalently bound to catalytic Cys145, 26 whereas its fatty acid tail occupies the hydrophobic S2 subsite. Carmofur inhibits viral 27 replication in cells (EC50 = 24.30 \u03bcM) and it is a promising lead compound to develop 28 new antiviral treatment for COVID-19. 29 30 (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder.

The number of confirmed cases 32 worldwide continues to grow at a rapid rate, but there are no specific drugs or vaccines 33 available to control symptoms or the spread of this disease at this time. 34 The etiological agent of the disease is the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. This virus has 35 a ~30,000 nt RNA genome. The N-terminus of the viral genome encodes two 36 translational products, polyproteins 1a and 1ab (pp1a and pp1ab) 1,2 , which are 37 processed into mature non-structural proteins, by the main protease (M pro ) and a papain-38 like protease 3 . M pro has been proposed as a therapeutic target for anti-coronavirus (CoV) 39 drug development 4-6 . We previously screened over 10,000 compounds and identified 40 Carmofur as compound that can inhibit M pro in vitro, with an IC50 of 1.82 \u03bcM 7 .",

The 70 carbonyl oxygen of Carmofur occupies the oxyanion hole and forms hydrogen bonds 71 (3.0 \u00c5) with the backbone amides of Gly143 and Cys145, mimicking the tetrahedral 72 oxyanion intermediate formed during protease cleavage (Fig. 1e). The fatty acid tail, 73 which appears in an extended conformation, inserts into the bulky hydrophobic S2 74 subsite (composed of the side chains of His41, Met49, Tyr54, Met165, and the alkyl 75 portion of the side chain of Asp187) (Fig. 1d, e). The hydrophobic interactions are 76 mainly contributed by the side chains of His41, Met49 and Met165, all of which run 77 parallel with the alkyl part of the fatty acid tail of the inhibitor (Fig. 1e and Extended 78 Data Fig. 2b). 79 The mechanism of covalent modification by Carmofur is different from that of the 80 inhibitor N3 7,19 , which covalently modifies Cys145 through Michael addition of the 81 vinyl group. The structures of M pro -Carmofur and M pro -N3 are overall similar (r.m.s.d. 82 of 0.286 \u00c5 for all C\u03b1 atoms).
