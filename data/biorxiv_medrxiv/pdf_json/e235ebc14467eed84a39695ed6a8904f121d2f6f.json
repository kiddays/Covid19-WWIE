Identification of the key underlying factors for 3 this disparity is highly warranted. Here we describe constructing a proteomic risk 4 score based on 20 blood proteomic biomarkers which predict the progression to 5 severe COVID-19. We demonstrate that in our own cohort of 990 individuals without 6 infection, this proteomic risk score is positively associated with proinflammatory 7 cytokines mainly among older, but not younger, individuals. We further discovered 8 that a core set of gut microbiota could accurately predict the above proteomic 9 biomarkers among 301 individuals using a machine learning model, and that these gut 10 microbiota features are highly correlated with proinflammatory cytokines in another 11 set of 366 individuals. Fecal metabolomic analysis suggested potential amino 12 acid-related pathways linking gut microbiota to inflammation.

It does not cleave (activate) prothrombin and plasminogen but converts the inactive single chain urinary plasminogen activator (pro-urokinase) to the active two chain form. Activates coagulation factor VII. May function as a tumor suppressor negatively regulating cell proliferation and cell migration Q06033 ITIH3 Inter-alpha-trypsin inhibitor heavy chain H3; May act as a carrier of hyaluronan in serum or as a binding protein between hyaluronan and other matrix protein, including those on cell surfaces in tissues to regulate the localization, synthesis and degradation of hyaluronan which are essential to cells undergoing biological processes P51884 LUM Lumican; Small leucine rich repeat proteoglycans; Belongs to the small leucine-rich proteoglycan (SLRP) family. SLRP class II subfamily P18428 LBP Lipopolysaccharide-binding protein; Plays a role in the innate immune response. Binds to the lipid A moiety of bacterial lipopolysaccharides (LPS), a glycolipid present in the outer membrane of all Gram-negative bacteria. Acts as an affinity enhancer for CD14, facilitating its association with LPS. Promotes the release of cytokines in response to bacterial lipopolysaccharide; BPI fold containing P15169 CPN1 Carboxypeptidase N catalytic chain; Protects the body from potent vasoactive and inflammatory peptides containing C-terminal Arg or Lys (such as kinins or anaphylatoxins) which are released into the circulation; M14 carboxypeptidases P13796 LCP1 Plastin-2; Actin-binding protein. Plays a role in the activation of T-cells in response to costimulation through TCR/CD3 and CD2 or CD28. Modulates the cell surface expression of IL2RA/CD25 and CD69; EF-hand domain containing P13671 C6 Complement component C6; Constituent of the membrane attack complex (MAC) that plays a key role in the innate and adaptive immune response by forming pores in the plasma membrane of target cells; Complement system P12259 F5 Coagulation factor V; Central regulator of hemostasis. It serves as a critical cofactor for the prothrombinase activity of factor Xa that results in the activation of prothrombin to thrombin P0DJI9 SAA2 Serum amyloid A-2 protein; Major acute phase reactant. Apolipoprotein of the HDL complex; Belongs to the SAA family P0DJI8 SAA1 Serum amyloid A-1 protein; Major acute phase protein; Belongs to the SAA family",

May be involved in the packaging of molecules destined for exocytosis; C-type lectin domain containing P05155 SERPING1 Plasma protease C1 inhibitor; Activation of the C1 complex is under control of the C1-inhibitor. It forms a proteolytically inactive stoichiometric complex with the C1r or C1s proteases. May play a potentially crucial role in regulating important physiological pathways including complement activation, blood coagulation, fibrinolysis and the generation of kinins. Very efficient inhibitor of FXIIa. Inhibits chymotrypsin and kallikrein; Serpin peptidase inhibitors P02768 ALB Serum albumin; Serum albumin, the main protein of plasma, has a good binding capacity for water, Ca(2+), Na(+), K(+), fatty acids, hormones, bilirubin and drugs. Its main function is the regulation of the colloidal osmotic pressure of blood. Major zinc transporter in plasma, typically binds about 80% of all plasma zinc; Belongs to the ALB/AFP/VDB family Constituent of the membrane attack complex (MAC)",
