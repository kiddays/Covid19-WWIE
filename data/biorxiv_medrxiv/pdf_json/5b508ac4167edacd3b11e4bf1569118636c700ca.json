Therefore, the testing of SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgM antibodies facilitates not only the diagnosis of COVID-19, but the evaluation of infection status as well. In fact, the testing of SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgM antibodies has been investigated with regard to its value in early diagnosis of the disease and has been adopted as one of the diagnosis criteria in the Chinese guideline. 4,5 However, the production of the antibodies and their protective effect, implication on the outcome and association with re-detectable positive RNA remain to be clarified. This work represents a retrospective analysis of 211 confirmed COVID-19 patients in Chongqing, China with their antibody testing to throw light on the development of SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgM antibodies and their association with the course and outcome of the disease and re-detectable positive RNA testing after discharge.",

The 145 patients with initial antibody testing results upon admission were divided according to positive and negative IgM and positive and negative calculated according to Jiong Wu et al. 6 The relation of antibody concentration with the duration of positive virus detection (the duration between first and last positive nucleic acid testing), duration of fever (the duration between first and last detection of fever as defined by temperature > 37\u00b7 3\u00b0C), length hospital stay, the progression of PII (PII value on day 7-10 after admission minus that within 3 days after admission) and outcome of the disease was investigated with the antibody testing result of 78 patients on day 16-21 after symptom onset. The predictive value of SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgM antibody concentration for re-detectable positive nucleic acid testing was investigated with antibody testing results of 74 recovered patients within 7 days after discharge. The difference in antibody concentration between the patients with and without re-detectable positive nucleic acid was studied with two repeated antibody tests performed on day 1-7 and day 8-14 with a 7-day interval in 40 patients, and the lymphocyte subsets of the 20 patients with re-detectable positive nucleic acid were examined.",

This study demonstrated a rate of re-detectable positive nucleic acid as high as 52.7% (39/74) despite strict adherence to domestic guidelines on discharge criteria, which may be attributed to the fact that SARS-CoV-2 mainly resides in the lower respiratory system. 21, 22 In addition, possible deviation in specimen collection may lead to false negativity of nucleic testing and consequently inappropriate discharge decisions, 23, 24 resulting in recurrence and even deterioration of the disease. The 20 patients with re-detectable positive nucleic acid displayed decline in lymphocyte subsets on the second admission, which was similar to the changes of initial infection. [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] These patients with SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid detected in nasopharyngeal swabs within 14 days after discharge had significantly lower IgG concentration compared to those with negative nucleic acid after discharge, but the difference in IgM concentration was not significant. Meanwhile, the changes in IgG and IgM tests with a 7-day interval did not display significant differences. Therefore, repeated nucleic acid testing should be conducted using specimens collected at multiple sites before discharge, 30 and the level of IgG may contribute to the discharge criteria. The results also suggested the possibility that IgG not only serves as a protective antibody, but also bears the potential to deteriorate the injury of multiple organs, which, if proven, will raise concern on treatment with serum antibody of recovered patients, and may indicate IgG or its immune complex as indicators to evaluate organ injury and disease severity.",

The chronological mapping of the level of SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgM antibodies revealed a peak of both antibodies on day 19-21, after which IgM gradually decreased while IgG remained at a high level, which was consistent with the development of IgM. It has been reported that SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgM peak on the 3 rd week, after which IgM persistently decrease while IgG remains at a high level,9,10 but the analysis of SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgM tests in 40 recovered patients after discharge with a 7-day interval demonstrated a median decrease of 21\u00b7 2% in IgG regardless of re-detectable positive nucleic acid, indicating instant decrease of IgG after recovery and, therefore, that long-term protection provided by IgG requires further study, which may be helpful for vaccine development and raises questions on the timing of serum collection of recovered patients for treatment. The analysis of possible influencing factors of antibody development did not reveal statistical significance except for PII value, but the first part of the study indicated an increasing trend in the detection rate of the antibodies which peaked on day 13-15 for IgG and on day 16-18 for IgM. The first antibody test in this study was conducted on day 13 of symptom onset (IQR 11 th -16 th day), possibly due to the period of research, development and approval of the antibody detection kits as COVID-19 was caused by a novel coronavirus. However, a report by Long et al. found that the median time until seroconversion of SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgM was 13 days, 12 so the fact that antibody tests were conducted after day 13 does not weaken the findings of this study. Nonetheless, the higher PII value in the negative IgM group in comparison to the positive IgM group indicated severer respiratory symptoms in patients with slower acute humoral immune response.Until the validation of specific therapy for SARS-CoV-2, host immune system remains to be the most effective defense against the disease. This study found no correlation between IgG and IgM concentration and viral shedding, course and outcome of the disease through a retrospective analysis without the knowledge of SARS-CoV-2 viral load. Similarly, the study by Corman et al. did not find evidence for inhibition of MERS-CoV by neutralizing antibodies.11 The kit in this study mainly detected antibodies against nucleoprotein and spike protein due to the use of recombinant antigens containing the nucleoprotein and a peptide from spike protein of SARS-CoV-2, 12 and the IgG antibody against spike protein has been proved to induce severe acute lung injury in Chinese macaques through alterations in inflammation response as reported by Liu et al.13 Similar lung injury caused by SARS-CoV vaccines has been observed in other animal models, such as mice and African green monkeys,[14][15][16][17] and higher IgG concentration has been detected in severe and critical patients with COVID-19.
