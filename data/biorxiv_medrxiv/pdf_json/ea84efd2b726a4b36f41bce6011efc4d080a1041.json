The symptom of anosmia, that we previously reported to be an important predictive symptom of covid-19, was also heritable at 48%. Symptomatic infection with SARS-CoV-2, rather than representing a purely stochastic event, is under host genetic influence to some extent and may reflect inter-individual variation in the host immune response. Viral infections typically lead to T cell activation with IL-1, IL-6 and TNF-\u03b1 release causing flu-like symptoms such as fever. The genetic basis of this variability in response will provide important clues for therapeutics and lead to identification of groups at high risk of death, which is associated with a cytokine storm at 1-2 weeks after symptom onset 9 .",
