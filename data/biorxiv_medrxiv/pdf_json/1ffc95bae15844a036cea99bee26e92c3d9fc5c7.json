Till date 2144 cases of COVID-19 is confirmed in Bangladesh till 18 th April though the stage-3/4 transmission is not validated yet. To project the final infection numbers in Bangladesh we used the SIR mathematical model. We also tried to demonstrate the impact of control strategies like social distancing on the COVID-19 transmission. Due to large population and socio-economic characteristics, we assumed 60% social distancing and lockdown can be possible. Assuming that, the predicated final size of infections will be 3782558 on the 92th day from the first infections. To estimate the impact of social distancing we assumed eight different scenarios, the predicted results confirmed the positive impact of this type of control strategies suggesting that by strict social distancing and lockdown, COVID-19 infection can be under control and then the infection cases will steadily decrease down to zero.",

Till date (18 th April 2020) there are about 2.26 million confirmed cases of COVID-2019 and about 154K reported deaths globally [1] . Nearly 40% of the world populations are currently under lockdown by Govt. or community to reduce the transmission of this extreme contagious disease. COVID-19 is the viral infectious disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2, for which there is no treatment and vaccine yet. COVID-19 is transmitted by respiratory droplets and fomites with incubation period from 2 to 14 days [2] .Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research (IEDCR), Bangladesh first reported a COVID-19 case in Bangladesh on March 8, 2020 [3] . Since then, there has been a steady increase in the number of infections with 2144 cases on April 18, among which there are 1,994 active cases, 66 recovered cases and 84 deaths. In response, Bangladesh has employed international travel bans and a gradual lockdown. However, countries like Bangladesh are at a greater risk because of large population density, inadequate infrastructure and healthcare systems to provide required support. Initially, it was thought that hot and humid weather [4, 5] , a large proportion of the young population, and probable immunity caused by BCG vaccinations [6] , may help to keep infection number low.. However, larger portion of these outcomes are preliminary and correlation-based, thus additional confirmation is necessary for hard conclusion [7] .",

            "text": "We hereby present mathematical and epidemiological models for the COVID-19 transmission in Bangladesh. The trends of the maximum of pandemics follow the rapid exponential growth during the preliminary stage and ultimately fallen down [8] . The mathematical epidemic models are therefore based on an exponential fit for short term and long term predictions. The Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered (SIR) compartment epidemiological model [9] is used by considering susceptibles, infectious, and recovered or deceased status of individuals during pandemics. This SIR model has revealed a significant prognostic aptitude for the increase of COVID-19 transmission in Bangladesh on a day-to-day basis. We have also calculated the probable effects of social distancing and frequent hand wash with soaps or sanitizer on the increase of infections. Bangladesh announced a countrywide lockdown excepts the emergency services till 21 April. There are no exact data how many people maintaining social distances in Bangladesh, although our previous study (elsewhere submitted) [10] showed that 12.03% did not maintained social distances, however, the study was conducted through online cross-sectional methods thus a big portion of the population was not included due to unavailability of internet. The study also estimated that no one is free of risk of infection suggesting a longer period of lockdown is required for controlling the COVID-19 pandemic. In the present study, we also estimated the possible infections in case of 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, 90% and 99% populations are in lockdown. However, socioeconomic conditions in a country of more than 160 million populations with high density cause considerable challenges in implementing strict social distancing. Considering this dense population of Bangladesh and to know the effects of tiny percentages of differences of social distance, we assumed two scenarios. We estimated the prediction of highest infection cases where 99% and 99.50% people maintained strict social distancing. As the SIR epidemiological model is entirely dependent on data, it is very important to mention on the character of this data. Different diagnostic strategies are taken in different countries for the confirmation of COVID-19 cases. In Bangladesh, in the beginning testing has mostly been limited to persons travelling from infected countries and their direct contacts. Very recently, countrywide testing is started with the suspected persons as well as selected Pneumonia patients and symptomatic healthcare workers. As of April 18, Bangladesh has tested 21,307 samples (129/million) [1] . A number of recent studies [11] have shown that the effectiveness of coronavirus infection may vary due to the warmer weather. In addition, differential immunity of Bangladeshi people due to BCG vaccine [6] is already completely assumed in the data as basic reproduction number. Present SIR model forecast the transmissions as a result of stage-1 (persons with a travel history to infected areas/countries) and stage-2 (person-to-person contact). However, if the confirmed cases of infections start to surpass the predicted infection thoroughly, then the outbreak will enter a new stage, and no mathematical model explained above will be applicable. Nevertheless, as of April 15 th , there is no strong evidence for community transmission.",

Even though, the social distancing and scrupulous contact tracing actions are taken by Bangladesh authority, may limiting these virus transmissions to small groups, relocation of laborers, workers and small income groups could deteriorate the situation. Consequently, these factors need to be measured during constructing conclusions based on the current study. The missing expat populations with infections possibly will also influence the predictions but this could be a debatable issue as discussed below. However, if a considerable number of infections were missed, a point would have already become visible in the curve by the end of the April.",

We assumed that these people did not carry viruses from the capital to other regions as then the infection cases were very low. In addition, most of expats who returned to Bangladesh from infected regions did not follow home quarantines and be scattered in different part of the country. Some of them might carry viruses which are turning out to be true now. As a result, the exact scenarios of maintaining social distances in Bangladesh are indistinguishable.

The prediction results are illustrated in Figure 05 and tabulated in the third column in Table 01 confirmed that by social distancing, COVID-19 infection cases can be controlled and reduced as well as the ending of the outbreak will be rapid. In Table 02 we have summarized the predicted infection cases on the end of April, May, June, July and August.

As long as the disease is spreading the outstanding susceptible number declines each day. In addition, the persons who turn into infected today equals to the yesterday's number of susceptible multiplied by the rates of infection per day, but it might look unusual that we also multiply that result by how many were infected the previous day. This is because the rate of infection per day is for every infected individual. If 2 persons are infected the chance of any person else becoming contaminated is 2 times higher than 1 individual is infected. So any estimation of the rate of transmission of the disease needs information of the infection rate per day and the numbers of primarily infected and originally susceptible persons. At the beginning of an epidemic the number of persons becoming infected each day is perhaps bigger than the number recovering, so the number of infected will maintain growing until more person recover than be infected. The numbers of susceptible individual always reduces, but the number of infected and recovered at first goes up and then turn down.",

In accordance the final size of COVID-19 will be 3782558 cases which is obtained from the SIR model analysis. Early strict lockdown and social distancing is the key factors of prevented COVID-19 transmissions.

This may have an effect on the final size of outcome. For example, the infection rates in Italy and USA are still not become stable after more than 30 days of lockdown. They have witnessed the uppermost percentage of death as well. Conversely, South Korea, Japan, Singapore etc. has shown significant decline by imposing lockdown [1] . As estimated in a recent study [16] , a reduction of infections in Australia can be evident only if the social distancing levels go beyond 80%. Assuming the same pattern as Australia in Bangladesh as well (even though the lockdown in Australia was more strict with stringent police control over person movement activities), we can assume that till April 30 (37 days from lockdown) very tiny effect of social estrangement will be observed. By this date, Bangladesh may have reported cases as many as 21579 if 40% of Bangladesh population are susceptible that are shown in Table 02 . This number could rise significantly if community transmission (stage-3) turns out and transmissions due to the movement of industries workers and laborers. In addition, on May 31, Bangladesh should observe the peak of transmission predicted 2940692, if no further strict lockdown imposed. To reach on the numbers of infection, on 30 th of May, Bangladesh should expect around 259270 patients on a single day.",

Exponential increase is thought throughout to consider for the worsen-case scenario. A reduction of 90-95% can bring the condition to more convenient. In addition, if Bangladesh pursues the case isolation approach strictly, it is anticipated that the infection curve will begin flattening out soon. Naturally, the degree of accuracy of these estimates remains to be seen. In conclusion, qualitatively, both models show that the epidemic is moderating, but recent data show a linear upward trend. The next few days will, therefore, indicate in which direction the epidemic is heading. This investigative estimate shows that the transmission rate of COVID-19 in Bangladesh will be as high as 9.4 million and for the socio-economic conditions and some other practical considerations it is not possible to impose most strict lockdown. However, still now, the transmission rate per day and basic reproduction number for Bangladesh are nearly the level of global (1.5 to 2.5) range [17] . Due to the questionable small amount of testing [1] compare to other countries referencing a low transmission rate per day and therefore the lesser basic reproduction number than world. The mathematical epidemiological model SIR is used to forecast the short-term and long-term outcomes. The SIR model assumes all the infection cases to be symptomatic, which is a limitation and could be underestimate the actual cases because of an unsure number of asymptomatic cases. With this constraint, the SIR model satisfactorily predicts the cases till today (April 18). The prediction indicates that Bangladesh will enter equilibrium by the end of the first week of June with estimated total number of cases to be approximately 3782558, if no further stringent measures taken by the Government of Bangladesh. It is projected that the effect of social distancing will be visible shortly by the end of April. However, Bangladesh is on the door to go into community transmission due to reported infringement of quarantine standard by people as well as other sociodemographic characteristics. The predictions completed using the epidemiological model in this study will be unacceptable if the transmission goes into stage-3 massively.",
