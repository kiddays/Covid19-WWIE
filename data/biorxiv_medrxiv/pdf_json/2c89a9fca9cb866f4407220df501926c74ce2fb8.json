For all countries, a peak has been either observed (China and South Korea) or is expected in near future. The approximate dates and heights of those peaks imply in important epidemiological issues. Inspired by similar complex behaviour of volumes of transactions of stocks at NYSE and NASDAQ, we propose a q-statistical functional form which appears to describe satisfactorily the available data of all countries. Consistently, predictions become possible of the dates and heights of those peaks in severely affected countries unless efficient treatments or vaccines, or sensible modifications of the adopted epidemiological strategies, emerge.",

This constant t 0 characterises the beginning of the epidemics in that particular region; it is typically somewhat larger than the date of appearance of the first case. The normalising constant C reflects the total population of that particular country. For \u03b1 = 0, if \u03b3 = 1 we recover the standard q-exponential expression; if \u03b3 = 2, it is currently referred in the literature as q-Gaussian; for other values of \u03b3, it is referred to as stretched q-exponential. Through the inspection of the roles played by the four nontrivial parameters, namely (\u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3, q), it became rather transparent that (\u03b1, \u03b2) depend strongly on the epidemiological strategy implemented in that region, in addition to the biological behaviour of the coronavirus in that geographical climate. In contrast, the parameters (\u03b3, q) appear to be sort of universal, mainly depending on the coronavirus. Therefore, we investigate several countries with the basic assumption that these two parameter would not change much from one country to another and we fixed these values at the values that we determine for China since this country has already had nearly the full evolution of the pandemics. For several countries, except South Korea, this assumption seems to be working. The results of China and South Korea are given in Fig. 1 . It is evident that, although the functional form (1) does yield satisfactory results for both China and South Korea, the (\u03b3, q) parameter values differ somewhat for each of these countries. On the other hand, as can be easily seen from Fig. 2 , our assumption is corroborated by several * Electronic address: tsallis@cbpf.br \u2020",

Because of that, we have not included it here. We remind that the values for (\u03b3, q) used for the South Korea evolution curve of active cases also differ from those used for all the other countries, which reinforces the fact that some sort of exceptionality exists there, for reasons that are unknown to us. For all the other countries we have adopted the values of (\u03b3, q) obtained from the inspection of the entire curve of China.",
