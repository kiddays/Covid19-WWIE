In general, we observed a correlation between damage to the lung, as 137 defined by consolidation and inflammatory cell infiltrate, and staining with the high 138 mannose binding lectin HHL (Fig. 2a) . In normal lung, HHL staining was confined to 139 the bronchiole epithelium and basement membrane. In contrast, in infected and 140 consolidated lung tissues we observed binding to compacted alveolar spaces and 141 bronchial plugs. We also observed binding to inflammatory cells and sloughed 142 bronchial epithelium.

However, we did not observe a corresponding 222 immune response, and viral stability (33). Glycosylation of NA is essential for the 233 enzyme activity (33). M2, a small transmembrane protein of about 11 KD, is at 10-234 100 fold lower abundance than HA on the virus surface and has a putative N-235 glycosylation site at which glycosylation is not commonly observed (33-36). To 236 determine whether the increase in high mannose was due to influenza virus 237 glycoproteins or to changes in glycosylation of host proteins, we performed lectin 238 blot analysis in tandem with Western blot analysis of HA and NA, the major influenza 239 virus glycoproteins (Fig. 5b, Supplemental Fig. 11 ). Upon infection, we detect 240 increased levels of high mannose across multiple proteins, both influenza and host, 241 as determined by HHL binding. We observed a strong increase in high mannose for 242 a band correlating to NA (indicated by arrows, Fig. 5b) .

Carbohydrate recognition plays a significant role in innate immunity 276 proteins A and D (SP-A/D) (12, 42). Innate immune lectins are thought 280 to protect against infection through recognition of foreign pathogens. We focused 281 our attention on MBL2. MBL2 binds influenza viral particles and was originally 282 ascribed a protective role (43). However, knockout of MBL2 in mouse mitigated the 283 severity of influenza infection, rather than increasing viral load as originally theorized 284 (18). Upon binding, MBL2 activates the complement cascade and corresponding 285 inflammatory response (44). A recent study on critically ill patients infected with 286 H1N1pdm09 virus showed a strong correlation between levels of MBL2 in the blood 287 and patient death (19). In addition, schizophrenics and multiple sclerosis patients, 288 both have high levels of MBL2 and unusually high death rates from influenza and 289 pneumonia (45-48). These studies strongly suggest that MBL2 plays a determining 290 role in the severity of response, but how this occurs is unknown. 291 MBL2 recognizes several glycan epitopes including Lewis structures (14, 15), 292 high mannose (16), yeast mannans (17) and fucose (15). Given that high mannose 293 is a ligand for MBL2, we wanted to test whether MBL2 would recognize influenza 294virus-infected human cells. We incubated infected and control A549 cells with 295 recombinant human MBL2 and examined binding by fluorescence microscopy(Fig. 296 7). Uninfected A549 cells were not recognized by MBL2. In contrast, infected cells 297 were strongly recognized by the innate immune lectin. This data is in keeping with 298 previous work that demonstrated complement-dependent lysis of influenza-infected 299 hamster cells mediated through binding of guinea pig mannan-binding lectin (49).",

In contrast, 313 little is known about change in the host glycome upon pathogen invasion and how 314 this might impact disease progression. 315 Herein, we use a ferret model of influenza virus infection in tandem with our 316 lectin microarray technology (6, 8) to study the host response to the 2009 H1N1 317 influenza virus and its relationship to disease progression. Our data suggest that 318 induction of high mannose upon influenza virus infection is a key mediator of 319 severity. Based on our work and the current literature, we hypothesize that activation 320 of the unfolded protein response (UPR) upon influenza infection turns on expression 321 of high mannose, which is then recognized by the innate immune lectin MBL2, 322",
