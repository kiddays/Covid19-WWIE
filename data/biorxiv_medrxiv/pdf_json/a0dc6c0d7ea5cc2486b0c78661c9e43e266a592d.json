Here we analyzed SARS-CoV-2 sequence diversity across 5,700 sequences sampled since December 2019. The Spike protein, which is the target immunogen of most vaccine 5 candidates, showed 93 sites with shared polymorphisms; only one of these mutations was found in more than 1% of currently circulating sequences. The minimal diversity found among SARS-CoV-2 sequences can be explained by drift and bottleneck events as the virus spread away from its original epicenter in Wuhan, China. Importantly, there is little evidence that the virus has adapted to its human host since December 2019. Our findings suggest that a single vaccine 10",

Vaccine candidates typically include an insert that corresponds to one or more virus antigens, either derived computationally or from one or multiple strain(s) sampled from infected individuals. The first viral sequence derived during the COVID-19 outbreak, Wuhan-Hu-1 (GISAID accession EPI_ISL_402125), was published on January 9, 2020. As many vaccine programs initiated at that time, it is likely that this SARS-CoV-2 sequence, sampled in December 15 2019 in Wuhan, China, will be the foundation for a number of vaccine candidates. Compared to other RNA viruses, coronaviruses have a more complex molecular machinery resulting in higher replication fidelity. The mutation rate of SARS-CoV was estimated at 9.0\u00d710 -7 substitutions per nucleotide per replication cycle (10), a rate that is much lower than that of most RNA viruses (1\u00d710 -3 to 1\u00d710 -5 substitutions per nucleotide per replication cycle) (11) , indicating the limited 20 propensity of coronaviruses to diversify. Nonetheless, as the virus spreads more widely, it is important to monitor the introduction of any mutations that may compromise the potential efficacy of a vaccine candidate based on the first sequence.",

In the 5 case of SARS-CoV-2, mutations in the protein S, which mediates cell entry, are most likely to confer fitness to the virus as it adapts to humans.

We used likelihood-based, phylogenetically informed models assuming branch-specific substitution rates (18) and identified eight sites under diversifying selection (i.e. with a nonsynonymous/synonymous substitution rates ratio dN/dS > 1), including four sites in S: sites 5, 50, 614 and 943 (Figure 2A) . Three of these four sites rarely varied (with the variant amino acid found 5 in <1% of sequences) and only transiently diversified thus far during the epidemic. In contrast, site 614 changed rapidly: the D614G mutation was introduced into Europe in January and became dominant on that continent ( Figure 2B ) and then globally within two months (found in 55% of sequences) ( Figure S2) . Overall, at least two thirds of sites across the genome were under purifying or neutral selection (dN/dS<1): S=85.9%, E=68.0%, M=74.8%, N=65.6% ( Figure 2C ) 10 (19). While dN/dS ratios varied across genes, ranging from 0.32 (M) to 1.19 (ORF6), they were not significantly different between structural and non-structural genes (Mann-Whitney test, P=0.32) ( Figure 2C ). Per-lineage mutation rates per site, calculated on internal nodes, also showed no differences in mean values (P=0.90) or distributions (K-S test, P=0.89) between structural and non-structural genes ( Figure 2D ). Despite notable differences across structural 15 genes, all fell in the range of other RNA viruses ( Figure 2E ) (20) . Mutations were disproportionately neutral: all branches evolved under neutrality for >65% of sites; and half of all branches evolved under neutrality for >83% of sites ( Figure 2F ) (18).",

The distribution adhered to expectations of the neutral model and deviated significantly (Mann-10 Whitney test, P<1e-3) from those of increasing fitness ( Figure 3B ). Similar results were obtained when the SARS-CoV-2 and simulated phylogenies were iteratively down-sampled by 50% ( Figure 3C) . Therefore, we concluded that the sample size of sequences was sufficient to test for adaptation. Together, the SARS-CoV-2 population and phylogeny showed no evidence that the global spread of SARS-CoV-2 was related to viral fitness effects. 15 Last, we evaluated two typical vaccine design strategies, which rely either on sampled sequences or on computationally derived sequences that cover the diversity seen across circulating sequences and are in theory optimal compared to an individual isolate (30). We inferred the most recent common ancestors (MRCA) of SARS-CoV-2 S sequences sampled from Wuhan within the first month of the epidemic, from all currently circulating SARS-CoV-2 sequences, and from those 20 corresponding to closely related sequences sampled from pangolins (n=9) and a bat. There were 17 mutations between the human MRCA and the human-bat MRCA and 41 mutations between the human MRCA and human-pangolin MRCA. Overall, three segments in S reflected significant variability across species (AA 439-445, 482-501, 676-690) ( Figure 4A -B, Figure S4 ) (31). In contrast, when considering only human sequences, SARS-CoV-2 diversity was limited: both 25 MRCAs (derived from early Wuhan sequences or from all circulating sequences) were identical and is also made available for use under a CC0 license.",

These results suggest that SARS-CoV-2 has not, as yet, adapted to its host as it is spreading globally. Rather, our findings illustrate that epidemiological factors primarily 5 mediated the global evolution of SARS-CoV-2. While certain mutations have increased in frequency, these were likely exported to under-infected areas early in the outbreak and therefore given the opportunity to spread widely (founder effect). For example, in January 2020, a virus carrying the D614G mutation, which had not then been observed among sequences from China, was transmitted to Germany. Host and environmental factors permitted the establishment of a 10 sustained cluster of infections that propagated this mutation until it became dominant among European sequences and then globally ( Figure S2 ). There is no evidence that the frequent identification of this mutation is caused by convergent selection events that would have occurred in multiple individuals. The D614G mutation is at the interface between two subunits and thereby would not be expected to be part of a critical epitope for vaccine mediated protection (Figure 4) . 15 However, an S612L mutation, in the same region as the D614G mutation, has been observed after passaging a MERS-CoV isolate in the presence of two antibodies (in 5/15 clones after 20 passages) (33). The rare presence of the S612L mutation among MERS-CoV sequences (2 of 473 sequences from humans) indicates that it is unlikely to be a common escape pathway.",

While the possibility of a D614G escape pathway is unknown, mutations in the RBD constitute a likely path to escape antibody recognition, as described for Influenza (34, 35).

Yet, it is important to note that the virus was only recently identified in the human population -a short time frame relative to adaptive processes that can take years to occur. Although we cannot predict whether adaptive selection will be seen in SARS-5 CoV-2 in the future, the key finding is that SARS-CoV-2 viruses that are currently circulating constitute a homogeneous viral population. Viral diversity has challenged vaccine development efforts for other viruses such as HIV-1, Influenza or Dengue but these viruses each constitute a more diverse population than SARS-CoV-2 viruses ( Figure S5) . We can therefore be cautiously optimistic that viral diversity should not be an obstacle for the development of a broadly protective SARS-CoV-2 vaccine. and is also made available for use under a CC0 license.",
