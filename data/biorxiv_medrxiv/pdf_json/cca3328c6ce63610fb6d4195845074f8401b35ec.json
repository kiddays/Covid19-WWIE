The closely related polysaccharide heparin, the widely used anticoagulant drug, which is structurally similar to HS and is a common experimental proxy, can be expected to mimic the properties of HS. Heparin prevents infection by a range of viruses if added exogenously, including S-associated coronavirus strain HSR1 and here, we show that the addition of heparin (100 \u03bcg.ml -1 ) to vero cells inhibits invasion by SARS-CoV-2 by 70%. We also demonstrate that heparin binds to the Spike (S1) protein receptor binding domain and induces a conformational change, illustrated by surface plasmon resonance and circular dichroism spectroscopy studies. The structural features of heparin on which this interaction depends were investigated using a library of heparin derivatives and size-defined fragments. Binding is more strongly dependent on the presence of 2-O or 6-O sulphation, and the consequent conformational consequences in the heparin structure, than on N-sulphation. A hexasaccharide is required for conformational changes to be induced in the secondary structure that are comparable to those that arise from heparin binding. Enoxaparin, a low molecular weight clinical anticoagulant, also binds the S1 RBD protein and induces conformational change. These findings have implications for the rapid development of a first-line therapeutic by repurposing heparin as well as for next-generation, tailor-made, GAG-based antiviral agents against SARS-CoV-2 and other members of the Coronaviridae.",

In combination, Ori et al. 22 and Nunes et al. 12 identified 786 heparin binding proteins. In this study, 776 heparin binding proteins, from the previously identified list, were decomposed into amino acid sequences containing no less than 3 residues with at less one basic amino acid. To simplify the problem, the heparin binding proteins were fragmented into sequences containing the following combination of amino acids; BX, BXA, BXS, BXP, BXAS, BXAP and BXPS (where, B = basic, X = hydrophobic, A = acidic, P = polar and S = special). These sequences were compared using a metric based on the Levenshtein distance, a measure of the similarity between strings of characters, which is defined as the minimum number of insertions, deletions or substitutions that need to be applied to the characters to alter one sequence so that it matches the other. Sequences with a similarity score of greater than 0.7 (70% similarity) were considered highly conserved. These sets of highly conserved basic amino acid containing sequences found in heparin binding proteins were then used to identify possible heparin binding sequences within SARS-CoV-2 S1, utilizing the same Levenshtein similarity cut-off of 0.7.",

At the end of the injection the system returned to running buffer (PBST, red arrow). There was no dissociation. This is common in surface measurement, particularly in flow systems, due to the extensive boundary layer of liquid enabling rebinding of the analyte and often causes a substantial underestimation of the dissociation rate, koff, which can be remedied by the addition of soluble ligand 23 . The injection of 100 nM SARS-CoV-2 S1 RBD over the control channel, functionalised with just streptavidin, showed a small increase in response ( Figure 2B ) of the order of 10% of that seen in the measurement channel. Repeated measurements indicate that this is the maximum level of background binding. These data demonstrate that 100 nM SARS-CoV-2 S1 RBD binds specifically to heparin immobilised through its reducing end and does not interact to a major extent with the underlying streptavidin/ethyleneglycol surface. It should be noted that when biotin-heparin is anchored to the streptavidin layer, as in the measurement channels, such background binding will be reduced, since less of the underlying surface is exposed. This is illustrated in the competition experiments, in which soluble heparin was able to completely abrogate the binding of SARS-CoV-2 S1 RBD to the surface (Figure 3A) .",

The response when the surface returned to running buffer, PBST, was then measured. This is appropriate, since there is no appreciable dissociation of the heparin-bound SARS-CoV-2 S1 RBD when the surface returns to PBST ( Figure 2B ) and it ensures that any differences in refractive index of samples do not interfere with the measurement. At 0.0017 mg.ml -1 heparin, a small reduction in the binding of SARS-CoV-2 S1 RBD was observed ( Figure 3A ) and, as the concentration of heparin increased, the binding of SARS-CoV-2 S1 RBD decreased in a dose-dependent manner. SARS-CoV-2 S1 RBD binding was completely abrogated by 1.7 mg.ml -1 heparin. Enoxaparin was also found to inhibit the binding of SARS-CoV-2 S1 RBD, but on a weight basis was less potent than heparin ( Figure 3A) . Thus, a small inhibition of binding was observed at 0.017 mg/mL Enoxaparin and the maximal inhibition observed with this polysaccharide was 70% at 1.7 mg.ml -1 . These data indicate that heparin is ~30-fold more potent an inhibitor of the interaction of SARS-CoV-2 S1 RBD with immobilised heparin than Enoxaparin. We then examined whether short oligosaccharides could inhibit SARS-CoV-2 S1 RBD binding. A heparin-derived octasaccharide (dp 8) was without effect, but a decasaccharide (dp10) at 0.17 mg.ml -1 showed a modest inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 S1 RBD binding to immobilised heparin. Whether these data reflect a true requirement for a longer structure for SARS-CoV-2 S1 RBD binding or instead, reflect a selective reduction in the presence of particular binding structures in the polysaccharide as a consequence of the processes (\u03b2-elimination for enoxaparin and partial enzymatic heparin degradation for oligosaccharides), remains to be determined.",

This suggests that SARS-CoV-2 S1 RBD has a preference for tracts of saccharides that are 2-O and 6-O sulphated. Interestingly, the doubly desulphated heparins (heparin 5, heparin 6, heparin 7) possessed inhibitory activity, albeit lower than the native heparin ( Figure 3C ). Since the sulphation of the polysaccharide has a marked effect on its conformation [16] [17] [18] 24 these data suggest that the SARS-CoV-2 S1 RBD may have a preference for a particular spatial arrangement of charged groups. Completely desulphated heparin (heparin 8) has no inhibitory activity, indicating that ionic interactions with sulphate groups make an important contribution to the interaction of the SARS-CoV-2 S1 RBD with the polysaccharide. Per-sulphated heparin (heparin 9) inhibited most strongly of the heparin derivatives, but not as effectively as native heparin. Again, this indicates the likely importance of the conformation of the polysaccharide for SARS-CoV-2 S1 RBD binding, since sulphation on all available hydroxyls renders the polysaccharide more rigid and restrict is conformational flexibility 24 .",

Here, the ability of the SARS-CoV-2 S1 RBD to bind pharmaceutical heparin, studied using spectroscopic techniques, showed that SARS-CoV-2 S1 RBD binds to heparin and that, upon binding, a significant conformational change is induced. Moreover, moieties of basic amino acid residues that are common constituents of heparin binding domains, and accessible to solvent on the SARS-CoV-2 S1 RBD surface, form a continuous patch ((R454, R457, K458, K462, R466, R346, R355, K356 and R346 in Figure  7) , suitable for heparin binding.",

Since the SARS-CoV-2 S1 RBD does not dissociate appreciably when the system returns to PBST, this is when the response was measured, to avoid any confounding effects of differences of refractive index between samples. A control measurement (100 nM SARS-CoV-2 S1 RBD alone) was performed before each competition and used to calculate the percentage of maximum binding. This ensured that small changes over time in the responsiveness of the surface did not cofound the analysis.
