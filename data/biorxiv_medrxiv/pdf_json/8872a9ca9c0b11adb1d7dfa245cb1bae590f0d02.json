The Risk Of Bias In Non-randomised Studies -of Interventions (ROBINS-I) was used to assess study quality. 9 ROBINS-I contains seven domains: (1) bias due to confounding factors; (2) bias in the selection of participants for the study; (3) bias in classification of interventions; (4) bias due to deviations from the intended interventions; (5) bias due to missing data; (6) bias in the measurement of outcomes; and (7) bias in the selection of reported results. The categories for risk of bias judgement were \"Low risk\", \"Moderate risk\", \"Serious risk\", \"Critical risk\", and \"No information\", with a high-quality study defined as one showing a \"Low risk\" or \"Moderate risk\". Studies were excluded when the quality was \"Critical risk\" or \"No information\". R version 3.6.2 and Stata version 15 (StatCorp, College Station, TX, USA) were used for statistical analyses. All data are expressed as overall summary estimates and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Cochran's Q test and I 2 statistic were used to assess heterogeneity, with p < 0.05 for Cochran's Q test or I 2 >50% indicating significant heterogeneity, in which cases the random-effects model was used. Otherwise, the fixed-effects model was used. Heterogeneity was assessed by meta-regression of province, sample size, and age.

First, this study was retrospective, and most studies were preprinted articles that had not been peer-reviewed, leading to a moderate overall quality of the literature. Second, not all clinical characteristics were well-documented, such as chest CT or laboratory tests, leading to inconsistencies in the total number of each item calculated. This also led to heterogeneity. Third, all included cases were treated from December 2019 to February 2020, and many were reported by several hospitals in Wuhan, Hubei province. There may be repeated reports of some cases, leading to a significant heterogeneity and obvious publication bias. To overcome these issues, we used random effects for meta-analysis, meta-regression tests, and Egger's test. Finally, we were unable to determine the incubation period of COVID-19 because of the heterogeneity among studies in reporting the timeline of cases.",

Through literature retrieval and data extraction, we identified 20,662 patients confirmed to have COVID-19 reported in 147 articles. The patients ranged in age from 1 month to 100 years old, with a mean age was 49.40 years, which is consistent with a China CDC report.157 This suggests that the general population, regardless of age, is susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection. In addition, some studies suggested that advanced age is a risk factor for severe illness and mortality. 15,19,90,92 The proportion of males was 53.45%, indicating that COVID-19does not have a gender predisposition. Approximately 1 in 10 patients had a history of smoking, but whether this population was more susceptible to COVID-19 remains unclear. Of 8028 COVID-19 patients, 38.52% had at least one comorbidity, most commonly hypertension and diabetes. Any comorbidity is an important factor in poor prognosis. Patients with hypertension, diabetes, and cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases are at a higher risk of severe illness or death. 19,90",
