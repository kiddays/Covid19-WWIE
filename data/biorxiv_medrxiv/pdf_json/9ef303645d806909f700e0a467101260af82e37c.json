Serologic tests could be 32 complementary to PCR in these situations. The aim of our study was to analyze the 33 diagnostic performance of one serologic rapid test in COVID-19 patients. 34 Methods: 35 We evaluated an immunochromatographic test (AllTest COVID-19 IgG / IgM) which 36 detects IgG and IgM antibodies. We validated the serologic test using serum samples 37 from 45 negative patients (group 1) and 55 patients with COVID-19 confirmed by PCR 38 (group 2). Then, we prospectively evaluated the test in 63 patients with clinical 39 diagnosis of pneumonia of unknown etiology that were COVID-19 negative by PCR 40 (group 3).",
