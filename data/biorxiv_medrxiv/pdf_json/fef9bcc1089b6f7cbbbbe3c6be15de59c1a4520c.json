One of the medical fields that may experience significant consequences of the pandemic is that of psychiatry (2) (3) (4) . Importantly, individuals who already live with mental disorders may be particularly vulnerable to the psychological stress associated with the pandemic (4, 5) . However, data on how the COVID-19 pandemic affects this group of people is largely absent from the literature. Here, we report data from an investigation conducted at the psychiatric services of the Central Denmark Region (CDR), which has a catchment area of approximately 1.3 million people covered by five psychiatric hospitals providing inpatient and outpatient treatment of all types of mental disorders. Based on clinical observation and evidence of the psychological effects of both the current (6) and past (2) pandemics, we expected to find examples of \"pandemic-related\" symptoms of anxiety, obsessivecompulsive disorder, depression and psychotic disorders (e.g. schizophrenia).",

Subsequently, we conducted an electronic search for clinical notes containing at least one of the following words: \"corona\", \"COVID\", \"virus\", \"epidemic\", \"pandemic\", and \"contaminate/contamination\" (including compound words). A total of 11,072 clinical notes contained at least one of these six pandemic-related words. Then, these 11,072 clinical notes were screened manually (5514 screened by CR and 5558 screened by OHJ) to determine whether they described symptoms that seemed plausibly related to the COVID-19 pandemic. Specifically, the clinical notes were labeled with \"0\" (no pandemic-related psychiatric symptoms), \"1\" (possible pandemic-related psychiatric symptom) or \"2\" (pandemic-related psychiatric symptom). All clinical notes labeled 1 were reassessed by both CR and OHJ and relabeled as either 0 or 2 (lack of consensus was resolved by discussion and/or consultation with SD\u00d8). Throughout this process, it was attempted to distinguish between reactions to the pandemic, which appeared rational and reactions, which seemed pathological. This distinction relied on the use of qualifiers (e.g. \"very worried\" vs. \"somewhat worried\"), descriptions of worsening of otherwise stable psychopathology .

The results clearly suggest that this phenomenon exists among individuals with mental illness (2) (3) (4) . However, as the data from this investigation stems from standard clinical practice where the patients were not systematically assessed for pandemic-related psychopathology, we cannot speak to its overall prevalence. Nevertheless, we believe that our findings underline the necessity of taking urgent action to mitigate the negative effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on individuals with mental disorders. A low-cost intervention would be to simply discuss the ongoing pandemic and its societal consequences with patients seeking care in psychiatric settings -as this may lead to relief of pandemic-related symptoms via general comforting, and clarification of misunderstandings/false beliefs regarding the pandemic. This is also the advice we have provided to our colleagues in the CDR based on these findings. As an example, we have phrased three questions that can be used by the staff to initiate a conversation on the COVID-19 pandemic with their patients:",

This investigation was approved by the Chief Medical Officer of Psychiatry in the CDR as part of a quality development project (\"COVID-19 and mental disorders\"), which aims at optimizing the detection and care of patients with COVID-19 pandemic-related psychiatric symptoms in the mental health services of the CDR.ResultsThe initial screening resulted in 9405, 695, and 972 clinical notes labeled with 0 (no pandemicrelated psychiatric symptoms), 1 (possible pandemic-related psychiatric symptom), or 2 (pandemic-related psychiatric symptom), respectively. The reassessment of the clinical notes initially labeled as 1 resulted in 310 and 385 notes relabeled with 0 and 2, respectively. Consequently, there were 1357 clinical notes from 918 patients (621 females with a mean age of 36.3 years (SD=14.3) and 297 males with a mean age of 40.9 years (SD=13.8)) describing COVID-19 pandemic-related psychiatric symptoms. As expected, the majority of the 9715 clinical notes not describing COVID-19 pandemicrelated psychopathology focused on logistics (e.g. \"The appointment was rescheduled to a phone consultation due to the risk of COVID-19\"). The main diagnoses of the 918 patients and the type of the COVID-19 pandemic-related psychopathology described in their clinical notes are reported in Figure 1, which also shows the cumulative incidence of i) patients with pandemic-related psychopathology, ii) clinical notes describing pandemic-related psychopathology, and iii) confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Denmark 5 in the period from February 1 st to March 23 rd . The figure shows a clear association between the number of COVID-19 cases in Denmark (and the societal restrictions) and the degree of pandemicrelated psychopathology (predominantly anxiety).",
