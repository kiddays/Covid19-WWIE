From the perspectives of information and mobility, this work aims at evaluating to what degree the massive population has responded to the emergencies of the COVID-19 pandemic in China. Using the real-time and historical data collected from the Baidu Maps and Baidu search engines, we confirm the strong correlation between the local pandemic situation in every major Chinese city and the population inflows from Wuhan between 1 January and 23 January 2020. We further evidence that, in cities under more critical situations, people are likely to engage COVID-19-related searches more frequently, while they are not likely to escape from the cities. Finally, the correlation analysis using search and mobility data shows that wellinformed individuals are likely to travel less, even while the overall travel demands are low compared to the historical records. Partial correlation analysis has been conducted to test the significance of these observations with respect to other controlling factors.",

Wuhan, which has a smaller population than the other four cities, contributed even higher volumes of related searches in the early of January 2020.

As the collective responses of the population to the emergencies, the demands of information from individuals are higher as the local infectious situation becomes worse. The more infectious cases in a city, the more the residents of the city would search online for pertinent information. However, people are not likely to escape from the cities where they live, even when the situations are critical. The worse the infectious situation in a city, the less likely residents are to travel beyond the city. Furthermore, well-informed individuals are more likely to travel less, even while the total travel intentions are still low compared to the prior year. The more the residents of a city have engaged searches pertaining to the pandemic, the more likely those residents are to refrain from travel. The implications of these correlations include that, the more that timely information acquisition is attainable to and attained by residents, the more stay-at-home orders are likely to be followed, even, or especially, when there are more cases in a city.",
