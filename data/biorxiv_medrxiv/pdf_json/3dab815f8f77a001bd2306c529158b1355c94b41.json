On the other hand, many Asian countries give similar K values to the Japanese one. For example, the K value of Thailand is K = \u22120.036/d. The relatively high absolute K values of Asian countries from the beginning prior to strict social restrictions suggest that the population immunity may be formed more quickly in these countries than European countries 5, 6 .

Since the K is related with a dumping factor of the exponential constant, a systematic study of K may reveal the underlying reasons for regional differences in infection rate and mortality of COVID-19. Also, as evidenced by the comparison with the SI model calculations, the linearity of the K value is not trivial but is most likely to be caused by several consecutive infectious explosions. Focusing on the change in the value of K will help to improve and refine epidemiological models of infectious diseases with the same tendency as COVID-19.",

In France, where the spread started after about 10 days from Italy, K is \u22120.019/d from the early stages. The difference from Italy in K is probably due to the fact that the 10-days delay made it possible to implement aggressive containment measures in the early stages. Germany and Sweden are examples of countries' policies showing changes in the slope of their K values. On March 16, Germany began measures to prevent the spread of infection, including closure of most retail stores except grocery stores and pharmacies, restriction of operation hours of restaurants, and prohibition of assembly at religious facilities. This resulted in a steep K slope (K = \u22120.025/d). Sweden, on the other hand, sought to acquire population immunity and took relatively mild measures resulting in a moderate gradient (K = \u22120.018/d) lasting more than a month. UK took took similar measures in the early stage of the spread resulting in infection explosion with K = \u22120.007/d. It was tamed down (K = \u22120.020/d) after they introduced the strict policy.On the other hand, in Russia, the K value stays above 0.6 with a slope of K = \u22120.007/d, and there is no indication that the spread will converge yet.",
