The first diagnosed patient in Turkey has been reported by the Republic of Turkey Ministry of Health on March 11, 2020. Today, over ninety thousand cases in Turkey, and two million cases around the world have been declared. Due to the urgent need for vaccine and anti-viral drug, isolation of the virus is crucial. Here, we report one of the first isolation and characterization studies of SARS-CoV-2 from nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal specimens of diagnosed patients in Turkey. This study provides an isolation and replication methodology, and cell culture tropism of the virus that will be available to the research communities.",

It is a positivestrand RNA virus (family: Coronaviridae), showing high homology with SARS-CoV and bat coronavirus 4, 5 . SARS-CoV-2 is the seventh coronavirus known to infect humans; SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 can cause severe disease, whereas HKU1, NL63, OC43, and 229E are associated with mild symptoms 6 . The novel SARS-CoV-2 is the virus behind the pandemic outbreak originating from China 7 and this recent coronavirus outbreak presents enormous challenges for global health. The first diagnosed patient in Turkey was announced by the Ministry of Health on March 11, 2020. Since then, more than ninety thousand diagnosed patients have been reported, showing the urgent need for vaccine studies and anti-viral drug discoveries.

The emergence of coronaviruses at regular intervals poses an important threat to human health and economy of countries.

Also, before culturing the cells with the specimens, we wash the cells with FBS free media to remove excess of fetal bovine serum.

Therefore, MDBK cell line is suggested for efficient plaque assay for virus titration and antiviral drug screening. Furthermore, studies reported that plaque formation time for SARS-CoV-2 was 72h, however; in our study, plaque formation was observed in 6 th day of the infection, probably because of the virus low titer.

EvaGreen fluorescent dye (Biotium, USA) was added to each reaction mixture for real-time LAMP detection. Melt curve analysis and %2 agarose gel electrophoresis were used for the evaluation of the results. Here, the virus N gene was used as a target gene in SARS-CoV-2 and actin as an internal control. Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM): Infected Vero cells were scraped from the flask and centrifuged at 300xg for 10 minutes.
