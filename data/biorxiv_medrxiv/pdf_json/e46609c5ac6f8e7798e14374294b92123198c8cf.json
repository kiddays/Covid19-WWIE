            "text": "The exponential character of the recent Covid-19 outbreak requires a change in strategy from containment to mitigation. Meanwhile, most countries apply social distancing with the objective to keep the number of critical cases below the capabilities of the health care system. Due to the novelty and rapid spread of the virus, an a priori assessment of this strategy was not possible. In this study, we present a model-based systems analysis to assess the effectiveness of social distancing measures in terms of intensity and duration of application. Results show a super-linear scaling between intensity (percent contact reduction) and required duration of application to have an added value (lower fatality rate). This holds true for an effective reproduction of R > 1 and is reverted for R < 1. If R is not reduced below 1, secondary effects of required long-term isolation are likely to unravel the added value of disease mitigation. We recommend an extinction strategy implemented by intense countermeasures. 2 COVID-19 cases is above 2.5 million resulting in over 170,000 deaths [1]. Due to these 3 large numbers, the initial approach of containment, i.e. tracing contacts of patients with 4 laboratory-confirmed infection [2], is not applicable anymore and may even have 5 unintended consequences of hampering effective healthcare delivery [3]. Instead, the 6 majority of countries decided to use community interventions, like cancellation of events, 7 general social distancing and travel restrictions [4]. 8 These community mitigation measures reduce transmission, hence flatten the curve 9 and push the peak of new infections further into the future which eventually helps 10 preventing an epidemic peak that overwhelms health-care systems [5]. Numerous 11 studies support this strategy [3] [4] [6] [7]. There is no doubt that this is the right 12 course of action to protect the lives of many vulnerable patients. Nevertheless, 13 considering the basic reproduction of Covid-19 as well as the considerable variation of 14 regional availability of intensive care [8], drastic interventions are needed to push new 15",

According to recent estimates, we are probably at 23 least 1 year to 18 month away from large-scale vaccine production [5] . Independent of 24 the time it takes to develop a vaccine, the epidemic spread will also come to an end, if 25 sufficient people have been infected to establish herd immunity. Studies on the 26 effectiveness of the concept of disease mitigation with the objective to establish herd 27 immunity shows some potential in the case of pandemic influenza [11] . 28 In this study, we present an exploratory and model-based systems analysis that is 29 aimed at investigating the application of social distancing strategies to Covid-19. 30 Specific objectives of this research are: 1) to investigate the effectiveness of contact 31 reduction policies with respect to intensity and duration and 2) to estimate the amount 32 of time to establish herd immunity by considering the national health care systems of 33 Austria and Sweden, which are very different in terms of critical care capabilities. A 34 detailed description of model equations, assumptions as well as uncertainty of currently 35 available data are presented in the following section. Data uncertainty is addressed by 36 the analysis of alternative scenario runs to enhance robustness of model results. In a 37 concluding section, we compare our results to similar studies, discuss current limitations 38 of data availability and give recommendations based on exploratory results. 39 Method 40 Adapted SIR model 41 The current scenario of novel pathogen emergence includes considerable uncertainty 42 [12] . This means that a reliable scientific evidence base on Covid-19 is yet to be 43 established. Under these preconditions, the use of models for exploratory rather than 44 predictive purposes is more appropriate [13] . Accordingly, the simulation model 45 presented in this study was designed to identify and systematically explore important 46 qualitative behavior of this dynamic system that remains unchanged irrespective of 47 parameter variations. An adaptation of the popular susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) 48 model turned out to be most suitable for this purpose (see Fig. 1 ). In order to meet the 49 specific requirements of a simulation model on Covid-19 mitigation, the structure of the 50 original model was adapted accordingly. For instance, pathological findings of Covid-19 51 indicate that there is a considerable number of cases that develop mild or no symptoms 52 [14] . To account for this characteristic, we separated the infected population into those 53 that are asymptomatic and those that are not, which in the latter case leads to isolation 54 or hospitalization. The asymptomatic infected get resistant without prior isolation.",

For instance, estimates of the basic 86 reproduction number R0 vary within a range from 1.4 [16] to 4.71 [17] . Part of this 87 variation is explained by geographic variation of population densities and social habits. 88 Moreover, there is uncertainty in the percentage of asymptomatic cases. The outbreak 89 in a smaller isolated population is an opportunity to derive representative numbers by 90 applying comprehensive and repeated laboratory testing. One such example is the 91 outbreak of Covid-19 on board of the Diamond Princess cruise ship.

Given the large scale of temporal delay (up to multiple years for a 10% increment 213 of additional contact reduction), secondary effects of long-term social isolation such as 214 psychological distress, depression [32] , and increased mortality [33] are likely to 215 unravel the added value of disease mitigation.
