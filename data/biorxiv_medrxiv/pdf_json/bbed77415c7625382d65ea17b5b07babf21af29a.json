The design (referred to as Pneumask) consists of a custom snorkel-specific adapter that couples the snorkel-port of the mask to a rated filter (either a medical-grade ventilator inline filter or an industrial filter). This design has been tested for the sealing capability of the mask, filter performance, CO2 buildup and clinical usability. These tests found the Pneumask capable of forming a seal that exceeds the standards required for half-face respirators or N95 respirators. Filter testing indicates a range of options with varying performance depending on the quality of filter selected, but with typical filter performance exceeding or comparable to the N95 standard. CO2 buildup was found to be roughly equivalent to levels found in half-face elastomeric respirators in literature. Clinical usability tests indicate sufficient visibility and, while speaking is somewhat muffled, this can be addressed via amplification (Bluetooth voice relay to cell phone speakers through an app) in noisy environments. We present guidance on the assembly, usage (donning and doffing) and decontamination protocols. The benefit of the Pneumask as PPE is that it is reusable for longer periods than typical disposable N95 respirators, as the snorkel mask can withstand rigorous decontamination protocols (that are standard to regular elastomeric respirators). With the dire worldwide shortage of PPE for medical personnel, our conclusions on the performance and efficacy of Pneumask as an N95-alternative technology are cautiously optimistic.",

However, the supply of PPE in hospitals is extremely limited and the crisis is worsening by the day [2] [3] [4] , as the industrial supply chains are unable to scale up to meet current demand [5] . We propose a potential stop-gap solution which consists of three parts: an off-the-shelf snorkel mask, a custom (3D-printed / injection-molded) adapter, and a filter/filter cartridge. The primary benefit of a snorkel mask is providing a full-face shield and air seal while allowing for controlled intake and exhaust flows through rated respiratory filters. Such masks are already widely available in large quantities and designing to make use of this supply chain could allow better access to PPE for medical personnel during this crisis. Typical full-face snorkel masks have a respiratory snorkel-port located at the top of the mask consisting of 1 inhale and 2 exhale channels ( Figure 1 ). In most models, there is an additional one-way exhale port near the mouth/chin area. The full-face mask has been tested to withstand disinfection protocols, while still maintaining its seal performance after the disinfection. This allows the mask to be safely reused, if proper standard operating procedures are followed.",

Unlike many other open-source designs that are intended for ventilated patients or consumers, this mask is primarily designed to prioritize the protection of a healthy user, rather than the surrounding environment. It is assumed that users are alert and active during mask usage, can be trained on standard operating procedures, and have access to standard sterilization and disinfection methods used in hospitals. Additionally, the appropriate filters for Pneumask are currently only accessible to those with a hospital affiliation (in the USA, at the time of this publication). This concept is not intended for patient use. The goal is to couple the snorkel-port of the mask to a filter through a custom adapter. There are a couple of strategies with regards to the filter: (1) Rated off-the-shelf medical respiratory inline filters can be directly connected to the adapter, or (2) Alternative filter materials, such as NIOSH-rated industrial filters, can be attached with a second modular adapter. (A list of medical inline filters and industrial-used filters are listed in Appendix A Table 1 and Appendix A Table 4 .) Many of these filters are rated for a substantially longer life-span as compared to the standard disposable N95 respirators.",

This adapter connects the snorkel to a single standard respiratory filter that is already in supply at many hospitals. All air from inhale is meant to be channeled through this adapter. An optional one-way valve can be placed between the adapter and the filter to prevent any exhaled air from going back to the filter, which lowers fogging and CO2 buildup. Optional valve and air pathway modifications are discussed in the adapter design supplementary.

We found this force to be 17lbs, which was the same as for the supplied snorkel, and compared favorably with our measured linear pull force necessary to disconnect the 22mm male ISO adapter/female ISO Virex filter coupling of 9lbs. The configuration of the Pneumask-G design shown in figure 3A can be implemented with any rated filter with an ISO 22mm OD port. This includes both HME filters (some of which are HEPA-rated) and viral filters. The performance of the design in terms of 1) work of breath and 2) CO2 accumulation will depend on the filter that is used inline in the system. Performance of different filters is discussed in the filter testing section.",

The output port is designed to connect to standard cartridge filters by 3M. Two gaskets are required to mount these filters (Figure 4b) , and typically must be ordered separately.

The epoxy was allowed to cure for 24 hours and the assembly was subsequently washed with isopropyl alcohol for 2 minutes. The adapter which sampled from the eye chamber and mouth chamber used a flexible tube to sample air from a desired location. This adapter was modified by drilling a hole large enough for the flexible tube to pass through. The hole was once again cleaned and a luer lock connector was pressed into the tube.

The incense produces particles of various sizes, including those in the range picked up by the detector (0.3 \u00b5m -10 \u00b5m). With the pump on, we measure the number of particles produced by the incense. Then we place the filter on the setup and run the particle counter to measure the number of unfiltered particles. To calculate the filtration efficiency, we calculate the ratio of unfiltered particles to the number of particles produced by the incense, and then subtract from one. The filter efficiencies for the 3 filters tested are reported in Figure 15 . We constructed an experimental system for measuring the pressure drop across various materials, including N95 masks, during inhalation and exhalation.

            "text": "One concern our team had was the ability for particulates to enter through the chin exhalation valve. As these snorkel valves are not medically approved, it is necessary to understand the performance of the valves to assess safety. The NIOSH standard \"Exhalation Valve Leakage Test\" (Section 84.182) stipulates the pressures and flow rates necessary for equivalent performance standard to typical N95 respirators. Particularly, it states that: \"(a) Dry exhalation valves and valve seats will be subjected to a suction of 25mm water-column height while in normal operating position. (b) Leakage between the valve and valve seat shall not exceed 30 milliliters per minute.\" [28] With this specification in mind, we conducted the following test to determine technical equivalency to NIOSH standards, investigating if this sports equipment is adequate to meet industrial device standards. A chamber was glued around the chin valve using epoxy, and an 8mm tube was connected to this chamber ( Figure 17A ). The 8mm tube is connected to an opened water tank ( Figure 17B) . First, the water was allowed to equilibrate by manually opening the chin valve briefly ( Figure 17B) . Then, the mask was lifted up to create a water column of 30mm ( Figure 817C) , which corresponds to a negative pressure of 30mmH2O applied to the chin valve. As time passes, the small leakage of the chin valve reduces the negative pressure and therefore the height of the water column. The leak of the chin valve can be approximated as the ratio between the volume of air in 10mm of tube length, and the time it takes for the water column to go from 30mmH2O to 20mmH2O. On average, this time was 21 seconds. As a consequence, in steady state and for a negative pressure of 25mmH2O on average, the leak of the chin valve is on average 1.5mL/min (12 measurements, standard deviation 0.3mL/min). We conclude that the leak flow of the exhale valve (chin valve) is lower than the maximum flow allowed to comply with the NIOSH regulation (30mL/min for 25mmH2O of pressure). It is noted that this test was done on a one specific mask model our team had available, the Decathlon FreeBreath. Although our findings here are reassuring, there is a possibility that different mask models and manufacturers have varying quality of valves. We recommend quantifying this parameter prior to usage (especially prior to large-scale usage of any particular mask brand). The mask is lifted up (chin valve closed) to create a water column of 30mm, which means that a negative pressure of 30mmH2O is applied to the chin valve.",

Subjectively, it appeared comfortable but took a small adjustment period to adapt to breathing to a comfortable level.

A male, 38 years old healthy volunteer, under standard monitoring including ECG, SatO2, NIBP, EtCO2 and Inspired CO2 measurements, wore the Pneumask in the G configuration for a total of 80 minutes. During the test, the subject lied recumbent and without moving. An anesthesiologist was present at all times during the test, recording the vital signs trend and was instructed to stop the test if vital signs deteriorated in any way.

Our explanation is that the inspired CO2 rise triggered an increase in minute ventilation and respiratory rate, maintaining EtCO2 within normal values. In conclusion, after 80 minutes of mask use under resting conditions, there was no significant accumulation of CO2 and no deleterious effects secondary to the observed elevation of inspired CO2. It is likely that any accumulation under resting conditions will be minimal and automatically adjusted by the user by the normal physiologic response to CO2 buildup.",

For the second test, we monitored heart rate, SpO2, non-invasive blood pressure (NIBP), ECG, End-tidal CO2, Inspiratory CO2, FiO2, as well as a number of subjective measures including discomfort and stamina. The results of this test are summarized in 22. These results indicate that the change in Inspiratory CO2 throughout use of the device, in exertion that simulates that of most healthcare work, is negligible and in line with NIOSH standards [19] . Subjective comfort/discomfort was rated from 1 of complete discomfort to 10 of complete comfort. It is notable that this never fell below a rating of a 7. Further, the volunteer had an appropriate HR response for the level of exertion and no further alterations in physiological processes were noted. This indicates the device performs similar to elastomeric respirators under near identical conditions. The third qualitative testing was performed with Pneumask-G configuration on a Body Glove TM snorkel mask on one of our co-authors. A series of capnographic measurements were performed using a closed anesthesia circuit including EtCO2, pressure, volume, and flow measurements. Under normal respiration with an open mask purge valve, the EtCO2 is around 30 mmHg. Under regular simulated Operating Room activities, there was no rise in EtCO2 noted for 30 minutes. Once we closed the purge valve with tape, the EtCO2 rose to 33 mmHg with normal respiratory pattern. No rise was noted in EtCO2 with 30 minutes of regular OR activities. Work of breathing was noted to be more difficult in this setup.",

Computational runtime is around 8-9 hours per exhale-inhale cycle. We are currently solving these tests using 32 cores Intel XEON on a desktop machine (not on a compute server). Mesh size is 4.8M cells, so we have 150k cells per core. The timestep is set at 0.01s, to compromise between compute speed and quality, with a CFL number around \u2248 20. One-way valve modeling poses some challenges numerically in the model: to avoid the numerical cost of mesh motion, and the very thin gaps present during opening and closing of the purge valves, the valves are modeled by simply varying the porous resistance of a porous region at the location of the valve. Therefore, the viscous resistance is set to a very high value to force the flow to practically zero when air would flow against the valve's direction. For flow in the valve's direction, the resistance is set to a value that reproduces the pressure drop across the valve in its full-open position. To be clear, the variable porous resistance is currently not set based on the local flow field at each valve, which would be more physical, but caused substantial numerical instability. Instead, each valve's resistance parameter is set based on the global direction of the flow (inhaling, vs exhaling). This approach is only valid since the flow changes direction almost instantaneously throughout the computational domain. While this solution is pragmatic, and allows us to perform the desired qualitative ranking of the CO2 buildup of different mask configurations with quick turn-around, it can indeed be further improved.",

Among these, some hydrogen peroxide solutions, such as Accelerated Hydrogen Peroxide, offer the advantage of potentially being less harmful to the user and equipment, while only requiring a short contact time of just a few minutes.

Modification or blocking of the chin valve would require complete redesign of airflow pathway. (3) Use a single-usage filter if available. For filters designed for repetitive usage, follow the instructions and regulatory-approved extended use claims (EUC) of the manufacturers (4) Avoid prolonged usage if possible (5) Long-term durability of the adapter when subjected to many cleaning process cycles will likely be dependent on the exact material and manufacturing process. Please perform appropriate further failure testing to characterize usage lifetime of these adapters in the material that is used.

The number of healthcare workers without access to suitable PPE will continue to grow if no additional efforts are made, due to a discrepancy between demand and available supply. With lack of PPE solutions for health care workers globally, new alternatives have to be explored.

We encourage readers who wish to replicate our fit-testing results to perform quantitative fit testing with a very high performance HEPA-rated inline filter (standard is 99.97% efficient for particles at 0.3 \u00b5m). This is to ensure that the fit of the mask (sealing capability of the mask) is evaluated separately from the filter performance.
