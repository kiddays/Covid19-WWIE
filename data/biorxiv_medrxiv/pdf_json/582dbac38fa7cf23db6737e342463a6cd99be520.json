As of April 16, 2020, the daily growth rate of total cases in the U.S. is 5.1%, which accounts for 32,076 newly infected and confirmed people, and the growth rate in Italy is 2.3%, according to Wikipedia.

In the example of the U.S., the daily growth rate of 4.5% on April 14 became even increased to 5.1% on April 16. This might serve as an early warning in controlling the U.S. pandemic progression. But, current tracking systems of COVID-19 data are incapable of displaying such alarming signals, because they focus on the number of daily new cases, which is not normalized by the growing number of total cases, so fails to expose important changes in the trend of the virus spreading. To monitor the pandemic progression and 4 project the numbers in the coming weeks, it is better to watch the time course of daily growth rates, of which data visualization was not easily available. Below, with the example of the U.S. that has the most confirmed cases among countries, I present the COVID-19 time series visualization for monitoring the pandemic progression. Figure 1A shows new confirmed cases per-day in the U.S., South Korea and Italy, after adjusting the population size of Italy and South Korea to the one of the U.S. Each time series starts since the total cases became greater than 100 before population adjustment, so that computing daily growth rates of total cases becomes reliable.

Figure 3 shows the trend of the daily growth rates in the three countries. The value at each day on the trend curves is the average of 9 daily rates around each day, and the most recent value is the average of recent five daily rates.

The report shows that the daily new cases in Spain dramatically increased after a partial lifting of lockdown restrictions, clearly visualizing slowing down is much harder; the trend of the growth rates of France turned to increasing 8-9 days before, raising an alarming signal; the daily growth rate of Germany is currently close to the one of Italy, so the difference in the pandemic progression between Germany and Italy is estimated as zero day; the U.K. is following the trajectory of Italy 16 days behind. Interestingly, Sweden did not show big differences from other countries in new cases or growth rates, although it did not adopt nation-wide lockdown restrictions.",
