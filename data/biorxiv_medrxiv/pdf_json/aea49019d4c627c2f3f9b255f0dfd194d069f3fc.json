France became one of the most impacted country in Europe, behind Italy and Spain. On March 12, the closure of schools and universities had to be ordered, followed, four days later, by the announcement of a full lockdown of the French population starting on March 17. 4 Several models were developed in an attempt to forecast the transmission dynamic of the virus in France. Although these models were initially simplistic, and relied on the limited data available at the time, these preliminary analyses were helpful in predicting various epidemiological outcomes. Our first work sought to use a deterministic compartmental model to forecast hospital needs for each of the 13 French metropolitan regions. 5 Like others, our model predicted that, without strong control measures, the epidemic would overwhelm the French healthcare system, much like it was overwhelming the Italian one.",

Di Domenico and colleagues proposed a stochastic model to forecast the expected impact of school closures and telework measure in three French regions. 8 Ferguson and colleagues used an individual based simulation model to assess the potential effectiveness of mitigation and suppression strategies in Great Britain and the United States. 9 Both predicted that mild control strategies would be insufficient to successfully mitigate the epidemic. But the expected impact of control measures such as a lockdown, was necessarily subject to a lot of uncertainty, as it greatly depends on the level of reduction of contacts that could be achieved, which is hard to estimate.",

Bo\u00eblle). We then estimated the requirements in both non-ICU and ICU beds, considering the several age-specific lengths of stay observed in the AP-HP hospitals (without admission in ICU, pre-ICU and post-ICU admissions). Regarding the data at our disposal, we chose to only estimate the deaths of hospitalized infected cases, and we did not consider deaths in nursing homes and at home. To do this, we used the corresponding age-dependent risks of death and length of stay before death (set to be equal for both non-ICU and ICU) and estimated a weighting factor to match the observed number of deaths.",

We estimated that, over this period, more than 100,000 ICU beds might have been occupied at the same time at the national level. Regarding the mortality burden of the COVID-19, the French lockdown might have averted slightly more than 61,000 deaths in hospitals. These results varied slightly between regions, but the lockdown seems to have had an important impact in all regions. Indeed, the regional relative reductions ranged from 70% to 98% for the different considered hospital requirements and deaths. Related to theses regional disparities, we noted that the estimated reproduction numbers were surprisingly high in some regions, especially in Pays de la Loire and Nouvelle-Aquitaine with values greater than 4. However, these values may not reflect a high number of cases in these regions, but may be likely related to a more recent introduction of COVID-19 in the region (smaller initial lag were estimated for these regions compared to the other regions). This may also be due to population movements before the start of the lockdown to these two specific regions located on the West coast of France, which could contribute to bias our estimates.

Therefore, the differences and reductions presented here are relative to what would have happened if the transmission dynamics had remained unchanged. We did not model what impact could have had moderate mitigation measures compared to the lockdown. However, several studies already estimated that these moderate measures would be largely insufficient at mitigating the epidemic. 8, 9 The impact of seasonal variations in the transmission of SARS-Cov-2 is still unclear; therefore, we chose to not include a seasonal parameter in our model. Although data on the matter is very scarce, several experts suggest that the impact of seasonality on COVID-19 transmission could be modest. 19, 20 It appears thus reasonable to assume that the vast majority of the reduction has to be credited to the lockdown, even if it is impossible, for the moment, to disentangle the effect of the lockdown and the potential underlying effect of seasonality. Moreover, the mortality estimates presented here do not take into account deaths occurring outside hospitals (at home or in nursing homes) as we limited our analysis to hospital data. As with many countries, the true overall mortality in France remains unknown, as it is likely that many deaths actually related to COVID-19 might not have been identified as such. The impact of the lockdown may thus remain unknown regarding overall mortality. Our model also does not account for the excess mortality that would have resulted from hospital congestion. Given the important excess hospitalizations and ICU admissions that would have occurred without the lockdown, it is likely that it would have resulted in an important excess mortality due to the congestion of the health care system. Another point of concern is the underestimation of the number of deaths that would have occurred without the lockdown as the analysis was cutoff at one month, while a proportion of patients still hospitalized on April 19 might die afterwards, given the delay between hospital admission and death. Therefore, the lockdown might have averted more deaths overall than what is estimated here. Furthermore, our model does not include population movements between regions. At the time, we assumed that the impact would be negligible, as infected cases were present in most locations, meaning that the transmission was mainly driven locally. It is even more the case during the lockdown as travels are greatly reduced. Finally, we did not take into account the fact that some regions (like Grand-Est or Hauts-de-France) implemented mitigation strategies before the national lockdown because of clusters of infected persons. As previously discussed, the impact of such measures was likely to be modest at the time, and even so, this bias would tend to minimize the estimated impact of the lockdown. However, we can consider these measures were taken into account in the estimated reproduction number.",

Salje and colleagues used an age-stratified, deterministic, compartmental model to assess the impact of the lockdown in France, and current population immunity. 22 They estimated that the first month of the lockdown reduced the reproduction number from 3.3 to 0.5 (84% reduction).

They also estimated that on May 11, the currently scheduled date for exiting the lockdown, between 3.5% and 10.3% of the population will have been infected. Their estimations are almost identical for April 19 (around 3.4% to 10.1%). On the same day, we estimated that, without the lockdown, the attack rate of symptomatic cases would have been around 23%. Although we should also take into account asymptomatic cases, it is likely that without the lockdown, herd immunity might still not have been achieved at this point. Hence, the one-month burden we quantify underestimates the total burden of an un-controlled COVID-19 epidemic. Consequently, our results highlight the possible life cost of letting the COVID-19 epidemic run its course, and the need for various combinations of control measures to avoid a second wave of the epidemic after exiting the lockdown. Di Domenico and colleagues investigated possible exit strategies using a stochastic, age-structured, transmission model integrating data on age profile and social contacts in the \u00cele-de-France region. 23 They also estimated that exiting the lockdown completely without other control measures would lead to a second wave largely overwhelming the healthcare system. However, there is still a significant number of unknowns regarding the physiopathology of COVID-19. For instance, how age influences the susceptibility to infection, the probability of developing an asymptomatic form, the infectiousness of asymptomatic cases. Moreover, the impact of other factors on the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 (climatic factors, seasonal variations) remains unclear. Consequently, the future course of the epidemic is still subject to many uncertainties. More work is still needed to forecast the behavior of the epidemic under various scenarios for the weeks to come.",

Without this lockdown, the COVID-19 epidemic would have had a critical morbidity and mortality burden in France, overwhelming the French healthcare system in a matter of weeks.
