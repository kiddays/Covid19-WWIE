Here we present the cryo-electron microscopic structure of the SARS-CoV-2 RdRp in its replicating form. The structure comprises the viral proteins nsp12, nsp8, and nsp7, and over two turns of RNA template-product duplex. The active site cleft of nsp12 binds the first turn of RNA and mediates RdRp activity with conserved residues. Two copies of nsp8 bind to opposite sides of the cleft and position the RNA duplex as it exits. Long helical extensions in nsp8 protrude along exiting RNA, forming positively charged 'sliding poles' that may enable processive replication of the long coronavirus genome. Our results will allow for a detailed analysis of the inhibitory mechanisms used by antivirals such as remdesivir, which is currently in clinical trials for the treatment of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).",

The additional nsp12 motifs F and G reside in the fingers subdomain and position the RNA template (Fig. 3b) contacts to the RNA product strand may retain a short RNA during de novo synthesis 15 .",

K58 is located in the nsp8 extension, and interacts with exiting RNA (Fig. 3c) . Thus the nsp8 extensions may be regarded as 'sliding poles' that slide along exiting RNA at the rear of the polymerase to prevent premature dissociation of the RdRp during replication. The sliding poles could serve a function similar to the 'sliding clamps' of DNA replication machineries 23 .",

The nsp12 residue N691 may recognize the 2'-OH group of the NTP, thereby rendering the RdRp specific for the synthesis of RNA, rather than DNA. Our modeling is also consistent with binding of the triphosphorylated form of remdesivir to the NTP site, because there is space in the NTP site to accommodate the additional nitrile group that is present at the 1' position of the ribose ring in this nucleoside analogue.",

The eluted protein was dialyzed in dialysis buffer (150 mM NaCl, 50 mM Na-HEPES pH 7.4, 10 % (v/v) glycerol, 5 mM \u03b2-mercaptoethanol) in the presence of 2 mg His-tagged TEV protease. After 12 hours, imidazole pH 8.0 was added to a final concentration of 30 mM. The dialyzed sample was subsequently applied to a HisTrap HP 5 mL column (GE Healthcare), preequilibrated in dialysis buffer. The flow-through that contained the protein of interest was then applied to a HiTrap Q 5 mL column (GE Healthcare). The Q column flow-through containing nsp8 or nsp7 was concentrated using a MWCO 3 kDa Amicon Ultra Centrifugal Filter (Merck) and applied to a HiLoad S200 16/600 pg equilibrated in size exclusion buffer (150 mM NaCl, 20 mM Na-HEPES pH 7.4, 5 % (v/v) glycerol, 1 mM TCEP). Peak fractions were assessed by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie staining. Peak fractions were pooled. Nsp7 with a final concentration of 418 \u00b5M was aliquoted, flash-frozen, and stored at -80 \u00b0C until use. Nsp8 with a final concentration of 250 \u00b5M was aliquoted, flash-frozen, and stored at -80 \u00b0C until use. All protein identities were confirmed by mass spectrometry.",

Ab initio refinement was performed using particles from bad 2D classes to obtain five 3D classes of 'junk' . These five classes and the first polymerase reconstruction were used as starting references to sort the initial 1.3M particles in supervised 3D classification rather than 2D, as the latter tended to exclude less abundant projection directions. 514k particles (39%) from the resulting polymerase class were subjected to another ab initio refinement to obtain five starting references containing four 'junk' classes and the complex of interest. These classes were used as starting references in another supervised 3D classification. 418k particles (82%) from the class representing the complex were exported from cryoSPARC to RELION 3.0 30 . There, all particles were refined in 3D against the reconstruction previously obtained in cryoSPARC, using a mask including only the core part of the polymerase and a short segment of upstream RNA to obtain a 3.1 \u00c5 reconstruction. CTF refinement and another round of 3D refinement improved the resolution further to 2.9 \u00c5. Particles were re-extracted at 1.3 \u00c5/ px in a bigger box in Warp to accommodate distant parts of the RNA. Unsupervised 3D classification with local alignment was performed to obtain 2 classes: with nsp8b present, and without. 172k particles with nsp8b present were finally subjected to focused 3D refinement using a mask including the RNA, nsp8a and nsp8b.",

The structure was rigid-body fit into the cryo-EM reconstruction and adjusted manually in Coot 31 . After adjustment of the protein subunits, unmodeled density remained for helical segments in the N-terminal regions of both copies of nsp8. These nsp8 extensions were modeled by superimposing the nsp8 model (PDB: 2AHM; chain H) from the crystal structure of the nsp7-nsp8 hexadecamer 18 , in which the far N-terminal region of nsp8 adopts a similar fold. Careful inspection of the remaining A-form RNA density revealed that in our complex, instead of the originally designed short template-primer duplex (see above), four copies of one of the RNA strands were annealed to form a pseudo-continuous, longer RNA duplex. Annealing was mediated by a 10 bp self-complementary region within this RNA strand (Extended Date Figure 1c) . Nucleotides 5-18 of four RNA strands were modeled, whereas the flapped-out nucleotides 1-4 were invisible due to mobility and excluded from the model. The model was real-space refined using phenix.refine 32 against a composite map of the focused refinement and global reconstructions generated in phenix.combine_focused_maps and shows excellent stereochemistry (Extended Data e Cryo-EM processing tree.",
