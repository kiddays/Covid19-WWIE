This perception dates back to the pioneering work of McKeown and Record, who ruled out standard of living disparities in ARI mortality in 19 th -century England and Wales because of their highly-infectious and seasonal nature. As a result, the focus of research on the social determinants of infectious disease has been on inequity in chronic and endemic infections, such as Tuberculosis, diarrheal disease 7 , and HIV. Recently, however, attention has returned to social determinants of ARI, reflected in an increasing number of studies of disparities by race/ethnicity and SES in infection risk, severity and mortality for influenza [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] , RSV 13 and all-cause ARI 14-18 . Nevertheless, our understanding of the mechanistic links between SES and ARI-related risks remains underdeveloped, as does our ability to address inequalities in ARI outcomes.",

Respiratory viruses such as influenza and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), have often been described as 'equal opportunity infectors', implying little socioeconomic disparity in susceptibility. However, early data from the COVID-19 pandemic has underscored that the burden of respiratory viruses actually reflect and magnify existing socioeconomic inequalities 2 . These trends have been made clear in the United States by the alarming disparities in the toll of severe disease and mortality experienced by African-Americans 3 . At the population level, viral and immune factors are necessary pre-conditions for the emergence and transmission of pathogens causing seasonal and pandemic ARI 4 . At the same time, socioeconomic inequalities are clearly key drivers of exposure, severe disease, and mortality. The rapid pace of transmission and mortality resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic has shone a bright light on these disparities. But they are no less acute in the context of other causes of seasonal and pandemic ARI, despite attracting less attention. In this paper, we review the literature on socioeconomic and racial disparities in ARI infection, hospitalization, and mortality in the United States. By focusing on the existing literature on influenza, RSV, and all-cause ARI we hope to identify key principles of the relationship between socioeconomic inequality and ARI outcomes, as well as highlighting poorly understood areas that need to be addressed by research and policy in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic.",

However, such advances in population-level protection are often accompanied by a widening of disparities in outcomes, as new preventive measures and therapies become available first to the well-off. As recent discussions of the ability to practice social distancing, and whether a COVID-19 vaccine will become broadly available shows, these issues remain woefully unaddressed, and have significant implications for public health.",

In the UK, a case-control study matching children under 1 year old admitted to Sheffield hospital with clinical suspicion of bronchiolitis to healthy community controls identified from birth records found that children living in the two most deprived electoral wards, as defined using the Townsend index, were 1.5 times as likely to be admitted to the hospital and 1.7 times as likely to require a medical intervention than children living in other parts of the city 16 .

The COVID-19 pandemic has shown in stark relief the ways in which SES and racism structure ARI outcomes at every level from exposure to disease severity and mortality. However, despite the large toll of mortality exacted by seasonal and pandemic ARI and the clear evidence of disparities, the number of studies investigating disparities in ARI outcomes and incidence is too limited to help chart a way towards more equitable outcomes. Notably, most of the analyses discussed in this review come from data collected by studies in which identifying disparities was not a primary goal, and thus was not explicitly incorporated into study design and the enrollment of participants. Further, much of the previous work has documented disparities, for example by race/ethnicity, but has not explored the history of policies and practices that specifically marginalized these racial/ethnic minorities and led to disparate outcomes 45 . This echoes earlier findings that studies focusing on identifying and addressing social determinants are underrepresented relative to the importance of social factors in structuring infectious disease risk 46 .",

This reliance on clinical data is likely to under-count risk in populations without access to care, who are disproportionately likely to have low SES, and/or come from marginalized groups, e.g. undocumented immigrants, for whom real and perceived overlaps between medical and legal systems may serve as a disincentive to care-seeking.

The evidence turned up by our review, as well as the issues of racially and socioeconomic disparate exposure risks, coupled with unequal access to testing and treatment made clear by the COVID-19 pandemic, demonstrate that the principles underlying Link & Phelan's theory of SES and race as fundamental causes of health and illness apply to ARIs as much as many non-communicable diseases as well as infections more classically understood has having social antecedents, such as tuberculosis and diarrheal disease. Fundamental cause theory (FCT) posits SES drives disparities through its impact on the financial and social power to marshal the material and social resources that are protective of health 47 . FCT is a mainstay of the literature on SES-related disparities in non-communicable diseases, but has enjoyed very limited application to infectious diseases 48 . A key tenet of FCT is that these disparities are persistent and are likely increase even as population-level risk goes down. For example, medical innovation is likely to increase disparities because new interventions typically become available first to the well-off and well-insured. This strongly suggests that progress in the treatment and prevention of ARIs using antivirals, monoclonal antibodies 49 , influenza vaccination, and molecular genotyping to inform surveillance and control, are likely to result in increased inequality in both ARI incidence and severe outcomes. These issues have once again been front-and-center during the COVID-19 pandemic, as well-off individuals in the United States enjoyed preferential access to testing in the early days of the pandemic. Similarly, the ability to participate in 'social distancing' by working from home, having food and other essential delivered to one's home, and engage other protective measures are clearly a function of power and material resources.

Ideally, large longitudinal cohort studies with study samples that are representative of the US population would be available to estimate differences in incidence and risk and VE. A meta-analysis found that 97% of observational studies on influenza severity were cohort studies, but very few of these studies collected information on race/ethnicity and the authors do not report on measures of SES in their analysis 55 . To capture the components of risk associated with social disparities, these studies would ideally span multiple seasons and account for known factors associated with risk such as age, influenza infection and vaccination history, household composition, crowding, and other potential exposure and susceptibility related factors. In the absence of such studies, greater attention is needed to increase the socioeconomic diversity of the populations that studies of seasonal ARI risk and VE draw upon, as well as the potential impact of SES on infection outcomes and vaccine effectiveness. Where such data are not available, careful statistical modeling is essential. For example, approaches such as multiple regression with poststratification (MRP), which can be used to make unbiased population-level predictions from nonrepresentative data, may help address some of these questions while we wait for more detailed data 56 .",

For example, policies limiting or eliminating paid sick leave have been shown to increase rates of influenza transmission in the workplace, and to disproportionately affect racial/ethnic minorities 37 , with similar patterns evident in the COVID-19 pandemic. In order to be able to reduce transmission, symptomatic persons should be treated with antivirals (when applicable) and practice home isolation 57 . This cannot be achieved without policies that support rather than penalize such behavior. The lack of supportive workplace policies has been suggested to result in a population-attributable risk of 5 million additional cases of ILI in the US with a disproportionate burden on Hispanic Americans 37 . The lack of a health system ensuring equal access to prevention and care is clear a key factor in exacerbating SES-related disparities in seasonal ARI incidence, as well as undermining pandemic preparedness. However, in the absence of sweeping changes that would address the root causes of these disparities , targeted vaccination for influenza 58, 59 and RSV 60 based on age specific contact and transmission patterns has been theorized to improve both the efficacy of vaccines. Identifying high priority groups for vaccination has been shown to be effective in reducing disease burden when target groups are those with high-risk of infection or high transmission potential for both RSV and influenza [58] [59] [60] [61] .

New vaccine rollouts, such as an RSV vaccine and a universal flu vaccine, should include some targeted vaccination programs to ensure populations already at increased risk of infection are given access to new technologies to prevent the intensification of disparities. Nevertheless, FCT suggests that the long-term efficacy of such interventions is likely to be limited if the upstream drivers of inequality are not addressed: New pathogens and technologies will inevitably expose the weaknesses of existing strategies, once again opening up a gulf between the well-off and everyone else.",
