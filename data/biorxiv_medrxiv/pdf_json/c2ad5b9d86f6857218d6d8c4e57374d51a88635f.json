Regulatory elements located within ACE2 affect the expression levels of the PIR and 93 CA5B genes. PIR and CA5B are involved in NF-kB regulation and pyrimidine synthesis, 94 respectively. VPS13C, encoding a factor required for late stage endosome maturation, is also 95 controlled by a putative enhancer located in intron 11 of BMX, adjacent to ACE2. We propose 96 that ACE2 repression by SARS-CoV-2 trips a chromatin-based switch that coordinates the 97 activity of these regulatory elements and thus the genes they control. Collectively, these 98 changes inadvertently lead to the development of a pro-viral replication environment. 99 100 101 102 .

This reaction is important in mitochondria as it supplies HCO3 -202 ions required by pyruvate carboxylase for gluconeogenesis, and by carbamoyl phosphate 203 synthase 1 (CSP1) for pyrimidine biosynthesis (Fig 2B) [38-40]. Pyrimidines are important 204 host factors critical for viral genomic replication, mRNA synthesis for protein translation, and 205 phospholipid synthesis [41]. Inhibiting de novo pyrimidine biosynthesis impacts on SARS-206 CoV-2 replication [18]. CSP1 additionally produces a precursor for the biosynthesis of 207 polyamines, small aliphatic molecules that play important roles in virus replication. Inhibition 208 of polyamine biosynthesis significantly impaired replication of the Middle East Respiratory 209 Syndrome [MERS] coronavirus [42]. Targeted inhibition of CA5B encoded carbonic 210 anhydrase might therefore decrease levels of critical host factors pyrimidines and polyamines 211 -critical host factors needed for SARS-CoV-2 replication.

The VPS13 family are endoplasmic reticulum associated lipid transporters. 231VPS13C is proposed to act as a lipid transporter at organelle contact sites between (i) the 232 endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and endolysosomes, and (ii) the ER and lipid droplets, where it 233 transfers lipids, potentially bulk lipid transfer, between organelles to maintain lipid 234 homeostasis and organelle functionality[49]. Increased VPS13C expression is predicted to 235 increase the extent of contact and lipid transfer between these organelles. This in turn virus's replication capacity and pathogenesis, as the ER plays both a physical and 237 functional central role in the virus's capacity to replicate and form new viral progeny. 238Moreover, SARS-CoV extensively reorganizes the host cell's membranes infrastructure to 239 produce a reticulo-vesicular network of modified ER to coordinate its replication cycle[50].240 Alterations to ER-lipid droplet contacts mediated by VPS13C could support the virus's 241 required expansion and re-organization of ER membranes by altering lipid flow through the 242 ER [51]. Notably, cells infected with Hepatitis C virus (HCV), a positive-strand RNA virus 243 like SARS-CoV-2, contain ER-derived membranous structures that contain significantly high 244 levels of cholesterol, despite the ER of uninfected cells possessing relatively low cholesterol 245 levels [52]. Increased VPS13C-mediated ER-endolysosomal contact sites could increase the 246 capacity of endocytosed dietary cholesterol to be delivered to the ER and enhance the virus's 247 ability to replicate. Pharmacological impairment of endolysosomal cholesterol efflux reduced 248 HCV replication, [52] suggesting another possible therapeutic approach for investigation to 249 slow SARS-CoV-2 replication. ER stress, impacted by changes to VPS13C expression, may 250 also contribute to late infection stage NF-\u03baB activation (reviewed in [53]). 251 The significance of the putative enhancer for PHKA2, which encodes the phosphorylase kinase 252 regulatory subunit alpha 2, is unclear. Mutations in this gene have been linked to glycogen 253 storage disorders and glucose metabolism. Thus, linkages can be drawn to the increased 254 expression of CA5B, which impacts on gluconeogenesis. Notably, PHKA2 was downregulated 255 in plasma from individuals with hepatocellular-carcinoma caused by HCV infections [54]. 256 Theoretically, chromatin remodeling in response to SARS-COV-2 infection could down-257 regulate PHKA2 expression. However, there is a paucity of information linking this gene to 258 viral infections or the lung and this conclusion requires additional experimental support.",

Ideally, the Hi-C datasets should be derived from matched 276 tissues prior and post SARS-CoV-2 infection. Finally, the GTEx database has recognized 277 limitations, including the ethnic diversity of the samples. These limitations will form the putative regulatory regions in and surrounding ACE2 that regulate the expression 282 of PIR, CA5B, and VPS13C in the lung. We contend that viral induced chromatin-dependent 283 repression of the ACE2 gene increases the activity of these regulatory sites and promotes an 284 intra-cellular environment suitable for viral replication.

Elements located within and surrounding the ACE2 locus regulate the lung-specific 516 expression of PIR, CA5B, CA5BP1, VPS13C, and PHKA2. (A) Common genetic variants 517 (SNPs) located within the ACE2 locus form spatial cis-acting regulatory interactions with PIR, 518 CA5BP1, and CA5B across sub-TAD boundaries on chrX:15,300,000-15,600,000. Inter-TAD 519 trans-acting interactions regulate PHKA2 (3.2 Mb away) and VPS13C (located on chromosome 520 15). Visualization of TAD and chromatin interactions was performed using the 3D genome http://genome.ucsc.edu)[36], respectively. (B) Within ACE2, MAFs for the SNPs that tag the 523 regulatory sites showed significant bias in four different populations (i.e. African [AFR], Ad 524 Mixed American [AMR], East Asian [ASN] and European [EUR]) at one PIR (rs714205) andFig 2. Hypothesis: SARS-CoV-2 infection is associated with an ACE2 dependent switch 530 that alters expression of proteins that promote an environment for viral proliferation in 531 the lung. (A) In middle-aged non-infected individuals, control regions within ACE2 are 532capable of downregulating the expression of PIR, which is involved in the NF-\u03baB pathway. 533Enhancer elements within ACE2 are poised to upregulate CA5B expression, which encodes an 534 enzyme important for pyrimidine synthesis. In addition to this, an enhancer region within the 535 BMX gene (still within the same TAD) contributes to VPS13C regulation. (B) We hypothesize 536",
