The lognormal distribution provides the best fit for the truncated data (followed closely by the gamma and Weibull). However, we do not believe there is cause for excluding the non-positive data and would caution against making assessments and projections based on the truncated data.

However, if any of the recorded infections occurred in the midst of increasing clusters of cases, our estimates may represent successful (compressed) serial intervals anticipated during an epidemic growth period. Third, each infector's identity and timing of the onset of symptoms is probably based on an individual memory of past events. If the precision of the recall is impeded by time or trauma, case-patients may be more likely to relate infection over prior experiences (longer serial intervals) to recent experiences (short serial interval). By comparison, the recorded serial intervals may be skewed upwards by travel-related transmission delays from primary case patients infected in Wuhan or another city before returning home. If their infectious cycle begins while traveling, then we may not be able to detect events of early transmission with shorter serial intervals.",

Bars indicate the number of infection events with specified serial interval, and blue lines indicate fitted normal distributions for (A) all infection events (N = 339) reported across 86cities of mainland China as of February 19, 2020, and (B) the subset infection events (n = 158) in which both the infector and infectee were infected in the reporting city (i.e., the index patient's case was not an importation from another city). Negative serial intervals (left of the vertical dotted lines) suggest the possibility of COVID-19 transmission from asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic case-patients. These estimates reflect the recorded dates of onset of symptoms for 556 case-patients from 86 China cities, ranging from 0 to 86 years of age (mean 46.5 years, SD 16.2 years). Other recent estimates for the average COVID-19 serial interval based on case data from mainland China, Taiwan, Hong Kong, Vietnam, South Korea, Germany, and Singapore include 7.5 days (95% CI 5.3-19) [13], 4.4 days (95% CI 2.9-6.7) (17) , and 4.0 days [95% CrI 3.1-4.9] (18) , based on considerably smaller samples of 6, 21, and 28 infector-infectee pairs, respectively. Although none of these studies indicate negative serial intervals before the infector in which the infectee had symptoms, 9.73% of the serial intervals in our study are negative.",
