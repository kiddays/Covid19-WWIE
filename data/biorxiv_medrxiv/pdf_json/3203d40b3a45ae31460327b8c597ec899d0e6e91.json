As of April 10, 2020, the virus has 19 rapidly disseminated to over 200 countries and territories, causing more than 1.6 million confirmed cases 20 of COVID-19 and 97,000 deaths worldwide. The clinical presentation of COVID-19 is fairly non-specific, 21 and symptoms overlap with other seasonal respiratory infections concurrently circulating in the 22 population. Further, it is estimated that up to 80% of infected individuals experience mild symptoms or 23 are asymptomatic, confounding efforts to reliably diagnose COVID-19 empirically. To support infection 24 control measures, there is an urgent need for rapid and accurate molecular diagnostics to identify COVID-25 19 positive patients. In the present study, we have evaluated the analytical sensitivity and clinical 26 performance of four SARS-CoV-2 molecular diagnostic assays granted Emergency Use Authorization by 27 the FDA using nasopharyngeal swabs from symptomatic patients. This information is crucial for both 28 laboratories and clinical teams, as decisions on which testing platform to implement are made. 29 30",

DiaSorin Molecular had the lowest LoD (39 \u00b1 23 254 copies/mL), closely followed by Hologic (83 \u00b1 36 copies/mL). The modified CDC assay showed a final LoD, 255 of 779 \u00b1 27 copies/mL based on the results interpretation algorithm. It is worth mentioning that this assay 256 requires both targets to be fully detected, thus clinical samples falling in this concentration range would 257 be identified and repeated, potentially generating additional turnaround time and laboratory labor. In 258 contrast, GenMark could only detect 100% of replicates at 1,000 copies/mL, and was not able to reliably 259 detect replicates below 1,000 copies/mL, thus patient specimens below this concentration range could 260 potentially be missed. One important limitation to mention is that sensitivity using Probit analysis could 261 not be calculated for GenMark since Ct values are not available as part of the ePlex system result 262",

DiaSorin 268 Molecular and GenMark showed 100% specificity, while Hologic and the CDC assay initially had two and 269 one discordant results, respectively. Repeat testing of these three specimens showed that for Hologic, 270 NW-83 repeated as positive a second time and was therefore potentially a false positive and NW-85 was 271 negative upon repeat, meaning this result could have previously been a false positive as well. The 272 continued discordant result from NW-83 could potentially be attributed to specificity issues, since the 273 assay did not prove to be the most sensitive assay among those used in the study, with DiaSorin Molecular 274",

When it comes to the hands-on and turnaround time of the four assays in this study, the 281 throughput and workflow evaluation are clearly shown in Table 5 and are based on lab technologist 282 experience in our laboratory. As a routine real-time RT-PCR assay, the modified CDC requires nucleic acid 283 extraction, master mix preparation and PCR setup, standard PCR amplification, as well as interpretation to purchase additional instruments to allow for testing of more samples at a time in order to satisfy patient 289 testing volume requirements. The Hologic Panther Fusion platform has more of an automated workflow, 290 with five samples processed at a time after loading. The sample to answer time for the first five samples 291 is 2 hours and 40 min, followed by 5 results every 5 minutes after loading 120 samples; the total assay run 292 time for 120 specimens is approximately 4 hours and 35 min. It is also important to note that the Hologic 293 platform has longer hands-on time, since the technologist has to load the primers, probes, and other 294 consumables and the fact that 120 clinical samples have to be manually transferred to Sample Lysis Buffer 295 tubes. These steps, especially the pipetting of the specimen into the lysis tube, can be somewhat labor 296 intensive and time consuming, bumping the overall turnaround time for 120 specimens closer to the 7 297 hour mark. It is important to emphasize that each platform has their advantages. For workflow, TAT, and 298 ease of use, the three sample-to-answer platforms (DiaSorin Molecular, Hologic, GenMark) out-299 performed the modified CDC assay, which is a manual assay requiring many steps, specialized personnel, 300",

Accurate and actionable results have been at the core 233 of medical decision-making during this current outbreak, both in the inpatient and outpatient setting. For 234 hospitalized patients, results are critical for clinical management as well as infection control and cohorting 235 for bed management. Likewise, results are just as critical in the outpatient setting as the basis for social 236 distancing measures to slow the spread of infection. To that end, false negative results are particularly 237 troubling, since they inevitably lead to more exposures. Turnaround time is also critical for allocation of 238 limited resources, such as the limited availability of isolation rooms and real-time cohorting decisions. In 239 addition, healthcare workers need rapid results to ensure they are not exposing patients whom they are 240 treating. Moreover, levels of personal protective equipment (PPE) required by health care professionals 241 also vary depending on whether a patient is COVID-19 positive, requiring a rapid TAT to preserve precious 242 resources. Considering the transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2, which has recently been estimated to have a 243 basic reproduction number (R0) of 2.2, meaning that on average, each infected person can spread the 244 infection to an additional two persons, a false negative result can be devastating (15, 16).
