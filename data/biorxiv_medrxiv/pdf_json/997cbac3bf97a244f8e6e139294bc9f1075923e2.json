However, to our knowledge, no primary peer-reviewed data has addressed implications of COVID-19 for resident physicians, whose situation has only been described in editorials. 13, 14 We also sought to explore whether specialty-specific risks existed for COVID-19 infection. By surveying residency program directors among all departments within NYC from April 3-12, 2020, we captured the immediate features and impact of COVID-19 among resident physicians during the exponential phase of the COVID-19 pandemic in NYC. As future or recurrent outbreaks are likely, such knowledge may help tailor future interventions to mitigate the burden of COVID-19 among HCWs. directors, and contact electronic mail addresses were retrieved from either previous correspondence or publicly available search tools with ACGME via hyperlink (https://apps.acgme.org/ads/Public/Programs/Search). The survey was first distributed to 12 ophthalmology residency program directors in the greater NYC area, who expanded distribution to 188 additional non-ophthalmology training programs within their own institutions. As a second method, 303 programs identified separately in the ACGME database by two authors (M.P.B., A.H.A.) were also contacted electronically. Ultimately, at least one contact attempt was made at every known residency training program in the greater NYC area (approximately 340 total), as our two approaches may have overlapped.",

Second, 49.4% of residency directors answered \"yes\" to the question of whether resident physicians for whom they were responsible had suboptimal PPE. While this might reflect selection bias with respect to which residency directors chose to answer the survey, we note that 90/91 programs reported reuse or extended use of masks that are ordinarily disposable after a single use. Third, we find that some specialties may be at greater risk for contracting COVID-19 compared to others. In particular, anesthesiology had significantly higher numbers of confirmed COVID-19 residents than several other specialties. It is possible that the higher infection rates may be due to the critical skill of intubation provided by anesthesiologists, which comes with high probability of aerosolization and exposure to viral particles. 17 We recognize limitations to our current study. While not all presumed and suspected cases have COVID-19, we present these numbers given the high pre-test probability of infection in HCW with suggestive symptoms, as well as known limitations of RT-PCR detection of the virus. 15, 16 Future work using serological testing may provide a more accurate census of confirmed positives, as recent studies have shown. 18 Selection bias may have affected our findings, as fields such as ophthalmology may have been overrepresented due to the authors' connections to colleagues in this field, while other specialties may have been under-represented because of significant stress and lack of time to complete the survey. It is also possible that program directors whose residents have been affected by COVID-19 would be more likely to respond. However, we capture 91 NYC residency programs (out of an estimated 340 total residency programs) during a period of exponential pandemic growth, offering a unique perspective on the impact on resident physicians during what may be the height of COVID-19 in NYC. Indeed, capturing the experience as it happens avoids recall bias after the fact. It is our hope that this insight may allow locations not yet as substantially affected by COVID-19 to better anticipate the needs of resident physicians, who are truly at the front lines of an unprecedented challenge.
