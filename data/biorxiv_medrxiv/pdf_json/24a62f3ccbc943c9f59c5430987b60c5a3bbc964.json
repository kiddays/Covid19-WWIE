In this paper, a mathematical model is proposed to analyze the dynamic behavior of COVID-19. Based on inter-city networked coupling effects, a fractional-order SEIHDR system with the real-data from 23 January to 18 March, 2020 of COVID-19 is discussed. Meanwhile, hospitalized individuals and the mortality rates of three types of individuals (exposed, infected and hospitalized) are firstly taken into account in the proposed model. And infectivity of individuals during incubation is also considered in this paper. By applying least squares method and predictor-correctors scheme, the numerical solutions of the proposed system in the absence of the inter-city network and with the inter-city network are stimulated by using the real-data from 23 January to 18 \u2212 m March, 2020 where m is equal to the number of prediction days. Compared with integer-order system (\u03b1 = 0), the fractional-order model without network is validated to have a better fitting of the data on Beijing, Shanghai, Wuhan, Huanggang and other cities. In contrast to the case without network, the results indicate that the inter-city network system may be not a significant case to virus spreading for China because of the lock down and quarantine measures, however, it may have an impact on cities that have not adopted city closure. Meanwhile, the proposed model better fits the data from 24 February to 31, March in Italy, and the peak number of confirmed people is also predicted by this fraction-order model. Furthermore, the existence and uniqueness of a bounded solution under the initial condition are considered in the proposed system. Afterwards, the basic reproduction number R 0 is analyzed and it is found to hold a threshold: the disease-free equilibrium point is locally asymptotically stable when R 0 \u2264 1, which provides a theoretical basis for whether COVID-19 will become a pandemic in the future. : Stability of fractional-order nonlinear dynamic systems: Lyapunov direct method and generalized Mittag-Leffler stability.",

It quickly spread to all parts of the country and parts of Southeast Asia, North America and Europe. As of 5 February, 2020, more than 24550 cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) had been confirmed, including over 190 cases outside of China, and more than 490 reported deaths globally.

            "text": "Wuhan is the capital of Hubei Province, as the major air and train transportation hub of central China with huge population movement during the period of spring festival. The geographical factors plus self-sustaining human-to-human transmission in the community of the new coronavirus have added radical difficulties to the prevention and interference of this epidemic. The outflow of domestic passenger volumes from Wuhan was estimated to be 5 million during the spring festival, about 0.7 of which went to other cities in Hubei province. which made it difficult for the infected people to track back to the population. Government has progressively implemented metropolitan-wide quarantine of Wuhan since 23-24 January, 2020 which ultimately contributes a lot of the containment of virus. The epidemic was seeded by a force of frequent human contact generating from communication. Prasse et al. proposed a network-based discrete model to describe this condition and they found the networkbased modelling was beneficial for an accurate forecast of the epidemic outbreak [21] . Peng et al. constructed and analyzed a generalized SEIR model to analyze COVID- 19 and their work showed that the outbreak of COVID-19 in China could be dated back to the end of December 2019 [20] . In addition, the basic reproduction number R 0 is 'the expected number of secondary cases produced, in a completely susceptible population, by a typical infective individual'. If R 0 \u2264 1, on average an infected individual produces less than one new infected individual over the course of its infectious period, and the infection cannot grow. Conversely, if R 0 > 1, each infected individual produces, on average, more than one new infection, and the disease can invade the population [9] . There have been abundant articles estimating the basic reproduction number R 0 of COVID-19 to determine whether the epidemic disease will spread widely [14, 17, 23] . Meanwhile, in the process of infectious disease transmission, susceptible individuals contact infected individuals and become infected with a certain probability. There is a lot of evidence that the incidence rate is an important tool to describe this process [4, 5, 27] . It represents the infection ability of a infected individuals in per-unit time. So because of high infectiousness of COVID-19, the bilinear incidence rate is always considered. And the classical SEIR model assumes that the incubation of infected person is not infectious, but this assumption is quite different from the infection characteristics of the new coronavirus infection COVID-19 [26] . What's more, due to a variety of special conditions, patients with COVID-19 cannot be admitted to hospital for immediate treatment, and individuals infected with COVID-19 have a high mortality rate both in the incubation period and no-treatment period.",

However, in real life, the spread of infectious diseases depends not only on its current state, but also on its past state. Smethurst et al. find that the waiting times between doctor visits for a patient follow a power law model [25] . At the same time, a power law waiting time distribution P[J n > t] = Bx \u2212\u03b1 leads to Caputo fractional time derivative C t 0 D \u03b1 t of the same order [18] . And the Caputo fractional-order derivatives allows traditional initial and boundary conditions when dealing with real-world problems. Not only that, its derivative for a constant is zero. What's more, the precision of the Caputo fractional-order can supersede the integer order resulting from its changes at every instant of time and nonlocal behavior. Khan et al. [28] .",

There are a lot of research for COVID-19 that not only individuals are contagious, but those in the incubation period may have the same incidence rate as well as those with symptoms. So the infectiousness of the infected person's incubation period is considered in this paper. Also, considering an individual hospitalized with COVID-19, the different mortality rates are investigated in this model. Thus based on the above analysis and the memorability of Caputo fractional-order derivatives, a fractional-order SEI-HDR model for COVID-19 with inter-city networked coupling effects are built. Should such a model can be fitted with data reasonably well, some epidemic parameters can be extracted. Then, based on the official data given by N-HC (National Health Commission of the people's Republic of China [1] ) every day, several numerical examples are exhibited to verify the rationality of the fractional-order model and effectiveness of inter-city networked coupling. Compared with integer-order system (\u03b1 = 0), the fractional-order model without network is validated to have a better fitting of the data on Beijing, Shanghai, Wuhan, Huanggang and other cities. In the case of inter-city networked coupling effect, the results indicate that this system may be not a significant case to virus spreading for China, but may have an impact on preventive measures in other countries. Finally, the stability of disease-free equilibrium point is obtained by the basic reproduction number R 0 , which provide theoretical significance for the development of COVID-19 in futher.",

System (1) is solved by applying least squares method and predictor-correctors scheme. To evaluate the prediction accuracy, the data can be moved for a fixed number of days, say m, prior to March 18. The prediction model is determined upon the data from 23 January up to 18 \u2212 m March, 2020. Then we predict the course of the disease up to 18 March, and the number of omitted days m is equal to the number of prediction days.

One of the most significant findings to emerge from this investigation is that the fractional-order system has a better fitting effect than the integer-order system. In addition, in the case of the inter-city network effect, the results indicate that the network system may be not a significant case to virus spreading for China. Meanwhile, system (1) better fits the data from 24 February to 31, March in Italy and the peak number of confirmed individuals in Italy is predicted according to system (1). Moreover, the existence, uniqueness, and positivity solution by the initial-value problem of system (1) are establish. Then the local stability of disease-free equilibrium point are studied by the basic reproduction number R 0 . And in the absence of network, the sensitivity of R k 0 to the other parameters is analyzed, which provide theoretical basis for disease control.",
