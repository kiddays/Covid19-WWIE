First, the score carries information about the severity of lung injuries but does not sufficiently address their extension. For instance, for equal grade 3 scoring, some patients may have only one chest point graded 3 while others may have 3 chest points graded 1. Hence GS does not reflect the disease extension. Scores such as the median, the average or the maximum severity ultrasound grading are not pertinent. They are too naive to include specific or sufficient information on the extension of lung lesions. Besides, let us indicate that we collapsed the CT score \"extended\", \"severe\", \"critical\" to \"severe\" out of clinical simplicity, in order to match the 4 grades ultrasound scoring. In order to improve the ultrasound scoring, a further study is ongoing comparing CT and LU for each chest point, and associated with more refined statistics based on machine learning techniques taking into account linear and non-linearity effects such as the non-linear jump in condition between GS at 0 and 1. Although this approach suggests gains in specificity, a more complex scoring may not be easy to compute in practice.",

With better specificity, one may hope that LU could help appreciate the more or less typical character of COVID-19 disease and make it not only a screening tool but also an orientation diagnostic tool. Furthermore, if LU seems to be a reasonable alternative to chest CT in situations of compromised availability, LU must not compete with chest CT, especially when the patient requires closer lung status evaluation. Indeed, patients may not be \"ultrasoundable\", (morbid obesity, sub-cutaneous emphysema or any cause that prevents LU interpretation). Also, patients with pre-existing conditions such as emphysema, fibrosis etc. may have an abnormal LU affecting the relevance of the operator's interpretation. Due to the principle of ultrasound technique lesions without any contact with the pleural envelope will not be detected (air interposition). Although LU may be informative in terms of many conditions such as pneumothorax, pleural effusion, interstitial images or sub-pleural consolidation. CT has remarkable specificity for lung lesions and is the reference imaging for thorough investigations.",
