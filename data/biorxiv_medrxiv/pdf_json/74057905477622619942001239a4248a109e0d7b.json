            "text": "We introduce the problem of determining the mutational support of genes in the SARS-Cov-2 virus and estimating the distribution of mutations within different genes using small sample sizes that do not allow for accurate maximum likelihood estimation. The mutational support refers to the unknown number of sites mutated across all strains and individual samples of the SARS-Cov-2 genome; given the high cost and limited availability of real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test kits, especially in early stages of infections when only a small number of genomic samples (\u223c 1000s) are available that do not allow for determining the exact degree of mutations in an RNA virus that comprises roughly 30, 000 nucleotides. Nevertheless, working with small sample sets is required in order to quickly predict the mutation rate of this and other viruses and get an insight into their transformational power. Furthermore, with the small number of samples available, it is hard to estimate the mutational landscape across different age/gender groups and geographical locations which may be of great importance in assessing different risk categories and factors influencing susceptibility to infection. To this end, we use our state-of-the art polynomial estimator techniques and the Good-Turing estimator to obtain estimates based on only roughly 1, 000 samples per category. Our analysis reveals an interesting finding: the mutational support appears to be statistically more significant in patients which appear to have lower infection rates and handle the exposure with milder symptoms, such as women and people of relatively young age (\u2264 55).",

            "text": "Viruses tend to mutate rapidly for a number of reasons, including highly unreliable replication of their genetic content and the need to evolve, adapt and compete with the host organism. The rate of mutation varies widely across various types of viruses and has been extensively studied in the past [1] , [2] . It is known that RNA viruses tend to mutate faster than DNA viruses as RNA replication is much less accurate than DNA replication. Similarly, single stranded viruses are more likely to mutate than double stranded ones [3] due to their structural instabilities. There is also evidence to indicate the length of the viral genome is inversely correlated with the mutation rate, with shorter viruses mutating faster those having longer strands of genomic material [4] . Mutational and fitness landscapes of viruses are frequently used to determine their evolvability and potential to spread across diverse populations [5] , [6] , [7] . If the immune system of a host encounters viral protein from a strain it was already exposed to, its response is fast and the infected cells are efficiently eliminated. If the virus mutates at a very high rate, the host immune system may take longer to respond, giving the virus more time to replicate and spread. This phenomenon is known as antigenic drift [8] . It is hence widely believed that fast mutating viruses pose a greater health risk as they provide an escape mechanism not countered by the host. Nevertheless, some recent studies have shown that high mutation rates could also trigger rapid innate immune response in the host; they can also be a sign that the host is successfully fending of the infection and that the virus has to explore a significant number of changes to its genome to successfully compete with the immune system. Elevated levels of mutations can be disadvantageous to the survival of virus, at least at short time scales [9] . It hence remains an open problem to determine the exact causes for elevated mutation rates in some viruses and their correlation to clinical patient outcomes.",

Typically, coronaviruses have genomes including at least six open reading frames (ORFs). ORF1a and ORF1b constitute the longest component of the genomes are responsible for encoding two polypeptides, pp1a and pp1ab, which are jointly used to create a family of nsp proteins. The family includes replicasetranscriptase proteins, responsible for promoting cellular mRNA degradation and blocking the translation in host cells, thereby impairing the operation of the immune response, proofreading and scaffolding proteins, processivity clamps, as well as transmembrane proteins. The pp1a/b polypeptides are functionally combined using proteases, such as the native chymotrypsin-like protease. Viral structural proteins are encoded by the sgRNA region of CoVs, and include the spike (S), membrane (M), envelope (E), and nucleocapsid (N) proteins, as well proteins encoded by ORF 10. For RT-PCR testing and detection of Covid-19, the oligonucleotide primers and probes used should be selected from the nucleocapsid (N) gene region, per recommendation by the CDC and as provided in panels produced by IDT [15] . The latter panel is designed for specific detection of the 2019-nCoV (two primer/probe sets). As a control, additional primer/probe sets used as controls such as the human RNase P gene (RP) are included in the panel. It is hence of special interest to focus particularly on the N region of the genome, as high-rate mutations in this region may cause highly undesirable false negatives in the test outcomes.",

We downloaded the data on several occasions, starting from 04-03-2020, and continuing on 04-10-2020 and 04-14-2020. The data size grew significantly during this time span and in order to observe the influence of the sample set sizes on the estimates of the mutational supports we used different sizes of samples. We filtered the genomic datasets only to include nearly-complete samples i.e., those of length > 29, 000 nts, resulting in a total of 3511 samples in 04-03-2020, 5650 samples on 04-10-2020 and 8893 samples on 04-14-2020. We also downloaded the associated metadata. As the first step in our analysis, we used the sequence alignment software MUSCLE [17] to perform pairwise alignment of all the samples with the SARS-Cov-2 sequence of Patient 1, published under the name Wuhan-Hu-1, collected from a patient admitted to the Central Hospital of Wuhan on December 26, 2020 (GenBank accession number MN909847). Next, for each aligned pair of samples we generate a \"mutation profile\", a list containing the position in the reference genome in which the patient aligned to the reference has a mutation. We do not perform multiple sequence alignment in order to assess the mutation landscape as we need to analyze each patient data separately. The mutation profile lists are subsequently aggregated over all the patient samples, resulting in a mutation histogram accounting for all positions in the viral reference genome. The aggregate profiles are then partitioned according to the 11 genes they are located in on the viral genome depicted in Figure 1 . The total count of mutations for each location in each gene is used as a sufficient statistics for estimating the mutational support and distribution of the mutations in each of the 11 genes. To adjust for alignment artifacts introduced by sequencing errors, dropouts and alignment gaps, we removed all gaps encountered in the prefixes and suffixes and sufficiently long gaps (> 10 nts) within the alignments. Most gaps are encountered at the 5'UTR and 3'UTR regions of the genome, as expected from outputs of global alignment algorithms.",

In the first set of tests, we divided the patient mutations based on gender (Male/Female), based on age (under 55/over 55) and based on geographical locations (Asia/ North America/ Europe) and based on a combination of features for which sufficiently many samples are available, such as Male/Female, Below55/Above55, Europe. Since the number of samples per feature type may vary significantly, we performed two tests. In one test we used all samples available, while in another we adjusted for difference in sizes of the sets by subsampling the larger of the two classes to make the sample set sizes equal. The number of samples available for various classes is depicted in Table 1 . For data obtained on 04-03-2020, we used all the samples available for all the classes, without balancing the class sizes. For data from 04-10-2020 and 04-14-2020, we balanced the classes by subsampling from the larger of the two classes for both age and gender. For geographical regions, we used all 615 samples from Asia and subsampled Europe and North America to 1000 samples each for 04-10-2020. Similarly, we used all 636 samples from Asia and subsampled Europe and North America to 1774 samples each for 04-14-2020 to account for differences in class sizes. It is important to point out that by performing the experiments with different sample set sizes one can compare the quality of the estimates in the early stages of epidemics and later stages when more information about individual strains of viruses becomes available.

The problem of estimating the support of an unknown probability distribution or estimation the distribution itself in the context of small sample sets has a long history. The first line of work in this area is attributed to Laplace, as described in [18] , who introduced a class of smoothed distribution estimators termed add 1 (or more generally, add constant c estimators). These estimators adjust the counts of symbols in order to account for the unseen.",

We define the mutational support of a virus as the total number of genomic sites mutated in any viral genome in any individual (observed or unobserved due to limited testing) compared to a reference genome, which in this case is the Patient 1 genome, the first sequenced SARS-Cov-2 genome. Our postulate is that the mutational support provides a good assessment of the overall number of mutations encountered in a virus and its strains throughout an epidemic/pandemic outbreak. Other types/definitions of mutation rates for SARS-Cov-2 have been widely reported in the literature. What is referred to as the genomic mutation rate is the product of the per-nucleotide site mutation rate and the genome size, and it represents the average number of mutations each offspring will have compared to the parental (or ancestral) genome. RNA viruses have a per site mutation rate that lie in the range 10 \u22126 \u2212 10 \u22124 [19] . The mutation rate of a virus is often equated with the rate at which errors are made during replication of the viral genome. Clearly, determining the genomic mutation rate in a large carrier population appears to be a challenging task as each host will have a different mutation rate and due to the fact that distinguishing offspring and ancestors appears hard. Furthermore, replication errors may clearly not be the only mechanism behind viral mutations. The genome mutational rate for SARS-Cov-2 is estimated at roughly 2 to 3 mutations a month.",

We only remark that the estimator termed RWC (regularized weighted Chebyshev) optimizes the regularized risk described above, while the RWC-S estimator uses a risk objective which involves a different normalization term. By far the most frequently used method for distribution estimation is the Good-Turing estimator [12] , which in a slightly modified form may be described as follows. For a sequence x n of length n over an unknown finite alphabet, we let n i denote the number of times a symbol i appears in x n . Furthermore, we let \u03d5 t stand for the count of counts, i.e., the number of symbols that appear t times in x n . The estimator proposed in [13] combines the Good-Turing and ML estimators, the latter being used for the frequently observed symbols. For symbols that appear t times, if \u03d5 t+1 \u2265 \u2126(t), then the Good-Turing estimate is used to determine the underlying total probability mass, otherwise, the ML estimator is used instead. More precisely, for a symbol appearing t times, if \u03d5 t+1 \u2265 t we use the Good-Turing estimator, otherwise we use the empirical estimator.

From Table 2 , it is apparent that naive ML methods underestimate the mutational support in the ORF1a and ORF1b genes roughly two-fold and that the mutational support of both genes is roughly 10% of the total gene lengths. Note that it is interesting to observe that both the ML and RWC-S estimators indicate that the mutational support is higher in younger patients, but in this case the results may be explained by the uneven sample set sizes for the two patient categories (909 versus 1, 477) . Also, the mutational support of the N region is significantly smaller, amounting to roughly 1% of the genome length for both categories. Similar results may be observed for the case that patients are partitioned according to gender, as listed in Table 3 . An interesting observation is in place for the results pertaining to different geographic regions. Despite the fact that the number of available samples from Asia is smaller than that of Europe and North America, the mutational support in the ORF1a region of Asian patients is more than twice as large as that of North America. A similar result holds true for the case of ORF1b, where the European population has three times more mutations than the North American population. ORF1a encodes replicase polyproteins pp1a and pp1b, which implies that the replication machinery has undergone significantly more adaptations in Asia than North America. It has been documented that the ratio of ORF1a-and ORF1b-encoded proteins plays an important role in the replication efficiency of coronaviruses [24] .

This finding is of great significance for Covid-19 and other viral outbreak testing methods as it indicates that genomic regions used as identifiers for the virus may mutate much faster than predicted based on small preliminary sample set information and that one may have to change the primers used for testing as the disease progresses.

The important finding is that the mutational support of ORF1b is almost twice as large in the low risk population compared to the high risk population. This result may imply that the large mutational support is a result of a highly competitive virus-host interaction which forces the virus to mutate in order to gain advantage over the host's immune system.",

This is especially the case for samples partitioned according to gender, despite the fact that the number of mutations in female subjects in the ORF1b region was close to twice as much as that in male subjects. In addition, the probability of having a mutation at the highest probability sites is significantly larger in \"younger\" than \"older\" populations.

Nevertheless, the positional stratification of mutations is significant for patients from different continents, especially in the N region of the SARS-Cov-2 genome. The largest spread of probability mass is observed for patients in Asia which may be indicative of the larger exploration rate for mutations in the region where the outbreak originated. Another plausible explanation is that Asia, the origin of the pandemics, is in a later phase of the pandemic when compared to Europe and North America. The observation may also has an impact on the design of testing schemes which use the N region of the genome as for patients from Europe there exist only 2-3 sites with high mutation rates, with a similar trend observed for North American populations.
