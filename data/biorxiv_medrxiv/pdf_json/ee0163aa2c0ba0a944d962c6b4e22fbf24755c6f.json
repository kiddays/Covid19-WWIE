After adjusting cofounding factors, multivariate GEE analysis demonstrated that the antibody levels were comparable between day 31-40 and day 41-53 since disease onset. However, the proportion with a titer of 1:512 or above decreased from 52.8% during day 31-40 to 27.6% during day 41-53. Due to the lack of blood samples collected from patients in the later stages of illness, whether and when seropositivity rate declined below 100.0% remained unknown. How long any immunity in patients will last is a key and big unknown problem for safe and effect antiviral treatments and vaccines in the future [13] . For other coronaviruses, immunity after an infection was strong for several months, but then began to wane [14] . Chang [15] indicated that peak IgG titers in all SARS-CoV patients appeared at 1 month or 1 to 3 months after the disease onset, and a drop (4.4-fold on average) in IgG titers was evident between 1 month and 6 months after onset.
