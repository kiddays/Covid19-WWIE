This strain has led to an expansion of both advanced ICU capabilities within hospitals as well as the opening of lower-acuity hospital beds (e.g., field hospitals) with limited resources for more stable patients. For example, Michigan has one of the largest number of COVID-19 caseloads in the country and recently approved over 4,000 new hospital beds to provide care to COVID-19 patients. 1 Accurately identifying subgroups of COVID-19 patients at high-and low-risk for adverse outcomes using automated risk-score systems could help to alleviate this strain. In addition to assisting with directing care and resources, these systems could reduce direct contact and use of personal protective equipment for low-risk patients. 2 This could be particularly valuable for less experienced clinicians if provided through the electronic health record (EHR). Recent work, however, has demonstrated a paucity of validated high-quality models in COVID-19 patients. 3 The Epic Deterioration Index (EDI) is a proprietary early-warning prediction model that assesses the probability of hospitalized patients requiring a rapid response, resuscitation, intensive care unit (ICU)-level care, or dying. The EDI uses clinical data to calculate risk scores at regular 15-minute intervals throughout a patient's stay starting from the time of hospital admission. Although there is no published research on the validity of the EDI, ubiquitous use of the Epic EHR across the U.S. has led to growing anecdotal reports of its value in critically ill patients. 4, 5 Implemented in over 100 hospitals across the U.S., advocates have further promoted its use among COVID-19 patients despite the absence of published data on its validity in this population. 6 Based on an internal evaluation, an Epic Systems spokesperson recently stated that \"the model performed well [in COVID-19 patients] and\u2026some hospitals are now using the All rights reserved.

Our evaluation was limited by its focus on a single academic medical center and a relatively small number of patients. However, our cohort of 174 patients was diverse in gender and race and larger than many earlier reports. As compared to a recently described large cohort of 5700 patients hospitalized with COVID-19 in New York, our study cohort had a higher proportion of African Americans (44% vs. 23%) and patients with chronic kidney disease (26% vs. 5%) and similar proportions of women (42% vs. 40%) and patients with hypertension (61% vs. 57%), congestive heart failure (11% vs. 7%), diabetes (37% vs. 34%), and obesity (36% vs. 42%). 17 Our proposed EDI thresholds may be influenced by local factors, including patterns of COVID-19 testing, triage, and decision-making about hospital admissions and hospital-to-hospital transfers that contributed to our study cohort. These EDI thresholds should be validated in other settings to assess their generalizability. This further reinforces the importance of individual healthcare systems to validate scores like the EDI in their patients independently.",

Our study supports, in part, a role of the EDI to identify a small subset of high-risk patients who may benefit from additional resources and higher-level care and another limited subset of low-risk patients who may be cared for safely in lower-acuity settings. It also suggests opportunities to tailor and improve risk prediction for this condition beyond the EDI as growing data accumulates on COVID-19 patients. Echoing the findings of the recent systematic review conducted by Wynants and colleagues, accurate predictive models for COVID-19 are urgently needed. 3 However, we suspect no single institution will have a sufficiently representative sample size of COVID-19 patients to allow for the development of a widely generalizable model in this patient population. Thus, future prediction model development should draw data from diverse cohorts of COVID-19 patients across multiple institutions.",

Of these patients, 60 patients (34%) required ICU-level care, 34 (20%) required mechanical ventilation, and 7 (4%) died.

The performance characteristics of the 48-hour maximum EDI in this subset of patients are reported in Figure 3 . A total of 14 (13%) patients who never exceeded an EDI of 37.9 in the first 48 hours of their hospitalization had a 93% probability of not experiencing the outcome (i.e., negative predictive value) for the remainder of the hospitalization (median remaining follow-up of 3.0 days [IQR 1.5-5.8]) with a sensitivity of 96% above this threshold.",

Thus, we recommend the interpretation of individual EDI scores be based on whether a patient ever exceeds specific thresholds. The substantial variation in EDI scores also underscores the notion of diminishing returns when the model is run more frequently. Lastly, the proprietary nature of the EDI raises ethical and clinical concerns in the setting of a pandemic, in which resources may be scarce and could be allocated to higher risk patients based on the output of this predictive model. If the developers of this proprietary model openly shared their model parameters and validation, it could benefit the public by enabling the model to be refined and compared with other existing predictive models for specific clinical applications such as COVID-19.",
