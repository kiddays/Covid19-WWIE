We provide operational guidance on implementing such a system. 2 Background Worldwide, countries are implementing measures to contain COVID-19. Internationally, empirical data demonstrates that all countries that have been able to exert substantive control of the COVID-19 pandemic have implemented strong containment and social distancing, combined with extensive surveillance.1-3 Australia, too, has achieved success with its strong containment measures. Community compliance with such measures, estimated at over 80%4, along with strong border controls and wider testing and management of identified cases and contacts, has meant that case numbers have dropped from a peak of over 450 cases, to less than 21 new cases per day throughout the country as of 17th March 20205.",

Some modelling has raised concerns that where measures to control COVID-19 have been successful, there is likely to be a resurgence of community transmission when measures are lifted, and this cannot be contained by surveillance of hospital presentations6. Broader community-based surveillance and contact-tracing is a proven strategy for enabling early detection in infectious disease outbreaks7 and has the potential to address the resurgence demonstrated by modelling that only includes hospital-based case detection. Moreover, testing capacity, as well as case and contact follow up interventions, are continuing to improve internationally, meaning that more sensitive and sophisticated surveillance systems are increasingly possible.8-10",

This includes assessing test performance for varying COVID-19 prevalence, and assessing the benefits and costs of pooling, a strategy now being implemented in some settings with limited test materials15, 16 .

In other settings, provision of paid sick leave for those with fever and cough supports compliance of testing and home isolation.1 Strategies for effective community engagement from other pandemics also provide guidance in this regard.7,14 Also of great relevance is the response of the Australian community to date, which has demonstrated a high uptake of highly burdensome containment measures. 4 The community has also demonstrated a high uptake of testing each time testing criteria have been expanded.38 It is reasonable therefore to expect, that with a consistent and coordinated community engagement strategy and interventions that support timely and easy access to testing, uptake will be high.",

A focus of increased hygiene, social distancing and containment measures has been on protecting those at most risk of severe disease and hospitalisation such as the elderly, immunocompromised or those with chronic respiratory or cardiovascular disease.39,40 If such measures successfully protect vulnerable populations, we would expect to see a substantial decrease in the proportion of cases with severe disease, and therefore the proportion hospitalised.

It should also be noted that these results are for cross-sectional testing in the sentinel population, and would need to be repeated on an ongoing basis to constitute an effective surveillance system, entailing a high level of frequent, repeated and large-scale testing. Even if testing capacity were increased to the level at which the entire asymptomatic population could be screened, this could not be feasibly undertaken in a narrow time window.

Currently, a proportion of all cases identified in Australia are classified as 'unknown' source of exposure.5 As Figure  2 demonstrates, this by definition means their source of exposure is likely to have initiated multiple chains of transmission by the time the downstream case is identified. Widespread testing of all contacts, upstream and downstream, including low risk contacts around such cases, and even geographical/fomite related testing of possible sources of infection is the most effective strategy for filling the gaps in transmission mapping indicated by such cases, and therefore ensuring identification and management of such unrecognised community transmission.",

As Table 3 demonstrates, this is the case even if sensitivity following pooling were to drop to 70%, at COVID-19 prevalence ranging from 0.05%-3.If pooled testing is applied in low-prevalence settings with the expectation that sensitivity will be lower, messaging to the public must indicate that some cases may be missed, and that those with symptoms should isolate regardless of test results Table 4 demonstrates, at low prevalence, small changes in specificity result in large changes in the positive predictive value, and therefore most positive tests are false positives. At higher prevalence, the proportion of positive tests that are false positives decrease. Although specificity is considered high (100%) for PCR tests, the gold standard, the impact of reduced specificity is an important consideration when assessing rapid diagnostic tests coming to market. It may be that a contributor to the very high levels of asymptomatic disease reported in some settings may be partly due to lower test specificity, and this should be investigated further.",

In Australia, peak influenza transmission occurs from late May-early July. In addition, if COVID-19 has a seasonal pattern, and this is likely to be the case considering other respiratory pathogens and similar SARS-CoV viruses,41 any residual transmission that continues into these months is likely to be amplified by seasonal effects.

However, health facilities are essential services, and must continue functioning. Measures for heightened general infection prevention and control that cover both staff and patients, and deal not only with disinfection, but with patient and staff flow and which are linked to intensive surveillance, are a critical aspect of ongoing COVID-19 management in such settings even once elimination has been achieved. Such measures can and should also be applied to essential services and settings where there is a high proportion of vulnerable individuals (e.g. aged care), in the latter case not to prevent superspreading events, but to protect those most vulnerable to severe disease.",

Once community cases are identified, detailed and meticulous upstream and downstream contact tracing, linked to quarantining of all contacts, and both antigen and serological testing of all upstream contacts who may be the source of infection, will support elimination of community transmission, and rapid control if and when reintroductions of disease occur. This strategy optimises the likelihood of remaining in the elimination phase while allowing for ongoing lifting of containment measures.
