These masks are normally intended for single use, but their sterilization and subsequent reuse could substantially mitigate a world-wide shortage. In this study, we investigate PPE sterilization using ionized hydrogen peroxide (iHP), generated by SteraMist \u00ae equipment (TOMI; Frederick, MD), in a sealed environment chamber installed in the animal facility of an academic medical center. Following one to five sterilization cycles, five N95 mask models from three manufacturers were evaluated using three criteria: efficiency of iHP in sterilization (measured with bacterial spores in standard biological indicator assemblies), ability of sterilized masks to efficiently filter particles down to 0.3\u00b5m, and a quantitative fit test. Filtration efficiency was measured using ambient particulate matter at a university lab and an aerosolized NaCl challenge at a National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) pre-certification laboratory. The data demonstrate that N95 masks sterilized using SteraMist iHP technology retain function up to five cycles, the maximum number tested. Some but not all PPE could also be sterilized in the same manner, and pre-treatment with a handheld iHP generator was required for semi-enclosed surfaces such as respirator hoses. A typical environment chamber with a volume of ~80 m 3 can treat ~7000 masks per day, and as well as other items of PPE, making this an effective approach for a busy medical center.",

Shortages in filtering facepiece respirators (FFRs) such as N95 \"masks\", which are certified to filter 95% of airborne particles down to 0.3 \u00b5m, are particularly problematic because these normally single-use items are a mainstay of infection control. It has been widely reported that the US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) anticipates a need for as many as 3.5 x 10 9 N95 masks 1 in 2020 for US use alone, but estimates of total available supply are far short of that number 2 . The consequent need for N95 mask sterilization and subsequent reuse is therefore likely to continue for the foreseeable future.",

Recently, in response to acute N95 mask shortages, multiple strategies for mask sterilization have been proposed and studied, including exposure to ultraviolet (UV) germicidal irradiation, vaporized hydrogen peroxide, moist heat, ethylene oxide, and gamma irradiation [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] . In this study, we evaluate a recently developed technology, ionized hydrogen peroxide (iHP), as a method for sterilizating N95 masks and other PPE.",

Most recently it was added to EPA List N: Disinfectants for Use Against SARS-CoV-2, for use on hard, nonporous surfaces 25 . The active ingredient in iHP is 7.8% aqueous H 2 O 2 (an H 2 O 2 concentration 5 times lower than used with commercial VHP systems), which is flowed past a plasma arc and dispersed into a treatment chamber as a mist of micronsized liquid droplets. As it passes through the plasma, the hydrogen peroxide is ionized into reactive hydroxyl radicals, the active sterilant. iHP is commercially available in two implementations: a handheld sprayer device (\"Surface Unit\") and an environmental unit (\"Environment System\"). The environment systems used for this study were installed at the Dana Farber Cancer Institute (DFCI; Boston, MA) animal research facility for use in sterilizing incoming equipment and materials.",

Two PAPR hoods, one PAPR hose, and one face shield were pre-treated with a SteraMist handheld spraying device in advance of processing in the SteraMist-equipped chamber. Pre-treatment was intended to ensure delivery of sterilant to items with semi-enclosed surfaces (such as the inside of a PAPR hose). Treating with the handheld device consisted of spraying the equipment from a distance of approximately 0.5-1m for a few seconds per surface. Per manufacturer protocol, the 100-minute sterilization cycle in the environmental chamber included: an initial 15minute fill phase during which the mist was released; a 20minute dwell phase to allow the mist to penetrate the room; and a 65-minute scrub phase during which the exhaust was re-opened to aerate the space at a rate of 43 air changes per hour.

For the N95 masks, the BIs were placed under or adjacent to the masks. For the PAPR components and other equipment, BIs were placed on surfaces that were judged to be least accessible to the sterilant (for example, inside the PAPR tubing) ( Table 3) . The BIs were extracted using sterile forceps, placed in Releasat growth medium (Mesa Labs), incubated at 55-60\u00b0C, and monitored for bacterial growth using a colorimetric assay over a period of 10 days 27 . Previous work with G. stearothermophilus spores suggests that a conservative benchmark for complete sterilization represents a 6-log 10 kill; that is, a ratio in the number of surviving to initial viable spores in a BI of 10 -6 (Ref 28 ).
