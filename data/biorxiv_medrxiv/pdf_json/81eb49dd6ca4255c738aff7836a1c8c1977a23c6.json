They must be trained on large datasets, and perform best on common alleles. Their accuracy is degraded for rare or little studied HLA-I alleles which are poorly represented in databases. In that case, another approach is to train unsupervised models of presentation from custom elution experiments with little or no information about peptide-HLA association. For instance, MixMHCp [8, 9] can reconstruct, from unannotated peptide sequences, a mixture of generative models -one for each expressed HLA type. However, it makes simplifying assumptions about binding specificity, and is not designed to leverage available (albeit limited) annotation information from the Immune Epitope Database [10] (IEDB) to improve accuracy.",

It can be applied to patient-or experiment-specific samples and treats common and rare alleles on equal footing, avoiding potential database biases. We use a Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM), an unsupervised machine learning scheme that learns probability distributions of sequences given as input [11] [12] [13] . The RBM estimates presentation scores for each peptide, and can generate candidate presentable peptides. It also provides a lower dimensional representation of peptides with a clear interpretation in terms of associated HLA type, which can be exploited to train classifiers of HLA association from a small number of HLA annotations. The RBM has a simple structure with one hidden layer and weights connecting the input -the peptide sequence -to the hidden layer. The weights, along with the biases acting on both input and hidden units, are learned from a list of presented peptides (see Methods, Fig. 1b, Supplementary Figs. 1, 2, 3) . The RBM probability is interpreted as a probabilistic score of antigen presentation by any of the 6 HLA-I in the experiment. We applied standard alignment routines to reduce sequences to the most common length of 9 residues (see Methods).",

We calculated a Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve from RBM presentation scores assigned to a test set of presented versus generic peptides (Fig. 1c) . The Area Under the Curve of the receiving operating characteristic, AUC = 0.973, proves the RBM predictive power at recovering presented antigens. To further probe the applications of RBM to neoantigen discovery, we considered the missense mutations in 5 ovarian and melanoma cancer cell lines, filtered by expression levels and by the NetMHC-predicted affinity to HLA*A:02:01 [14] . We attributed RBM presentation scores to all 8-11-mer peptides harbouring these mutations.

To test performance in a case where the ground truth is known, we trained RBMs on 10 synthetic \"single-individual\" samples pooling IEDB antigens presented by 6 HLA-I proteins per individual, covering 43 different alleles in total (12 HLA-A, 17 HLA-B, 14 HLA-C, see Methods). Each HLA-I recognizes specific sequence \"motifs\" (preferred residues at each position) in the presented peptides. RBM hidden units allow for the mapping of peptide sequences onto a lower dimensional \"representation space\" (see Methods) which organizes them into clusters by motif, reflecting different HLA-binding specificities present in the sample (Fig. 1b) .

In practice these annotated sequences may come from other experiments or public databases. In our synthetic example, we randomly selected 10% of peptides and labeled them with their associated HLA-I. Using these annotations, we trained a linear classifier to predict the HLA-I restriction of individual peptides from their RBM representation (see Methods, Fig. 1b, Supplementary Figs. 1, 5) . We refer to this architecture, which combines the RBM (trained on unannotated peptides) and the HLA-I type classifier (trained on a few annotated ones), as RBM-MHC. The performance of RBM-MHC at predicting HLA association, as measured by AUC = 0.993, is excellent (see Fig. 1e and Methods). The RBM representation is crucial for achieving high prediction performance. Training a linear HLA-I classifier directly on the annotated sequences (rather than their RBM representation) yields a much poorer performance (AUC=0.724). On the other hand, a completely unsupervised clustering algorithm (K-means [15] ) applied to unlabeled data in RBM representation space ('RBM-km') performed well (AUC=0.935), while K-means applied directly to sequences did not (AUC=0.645, Fig. 1e and Methods).",

The major drop in MixMHCp performance occurs precisely in datasets that mix same-supertype alleles [16] (HLA-B*27:05 and HLA-B*39:01 belonging to supertype B27, HLA-B*40:01 and HLA-B*44:03 belonging to B44, see Supplementary Table 1) .

We tested the the RBM-MHC approach for motif reconstruction. Since in this case true peptide-HLA associations are not known, model performance is evaluated through the correlation between the predicted motifs and motifs reconstructed from IEDB monoallelic data ( Fig. 2a-b, Supplementary Figs . 8, 9, 10) . RBM-MHC, MixMHCp and NetMHCpan4.0 perform comparably, with the only exception of Mel15, partially explained by the limited number of available labels (for HLA-A*68:01 and HLA-B*35:03). RBM-MHC and its unsupervised version RBM-km, when trained on the patient dataset (see Methods) systematically predicted the correct HLA association for all neoantigens. They also assigned a top 1% score among all WES mutants to 8 out of 11 identified neoantigens (Supplementary Table 2 ).",

We plan to develop an extension to HLA class II presentation. As the MS amino acid frequency distribution is potentially affected by biases of the technique, we also designed a sequence re-weighting scheme to avoid overfitting and better score ligands tested in vitro (Supplementary Note, Supplementary Fig. 13 ). We stress that the method is not limited to MS datasets. As a timely application of the approach to SARS-CoV-2, we showed that affinity-trained RBM models recover with high probability SARS-CoV-2 HLA-I epitopes validated in vitro [20] ( Supplementary Fig. 11 ). MStrained RBM-MHC outperforms NetMHC versions [6, 7] used in Ref. [20] for rare HLA-C alleles (Fig. 2d) , although the validated peptides were selected by NetMHC itself. RBM-MHC also assigns high presentation scores to SARS-CoV-2 epitopes that are homologous to experimentally validated SARS-CoV cytotoxic Tcell epitopes [21] , on par with NetMHC4.0 [6] (Fig. 2e) and NetMHCpan-4.0 [7] (Supplementary Fig. 12 ). In general, our method is designed to be trained on custom samples, which could be of relevance to produce sample-specific insights about the complexity of endogenous HLA-I presentation.

MixMHCp merges Mel8 antigens specific to the 2 HLA-C into the same cluster, causing a drop in the average \u03c1 (see Supplementary Fig. 9 ). c, RBM distinguishes 2 subclasses in HLA-B*51:01-binding antigens. The HLA-B*51:01-peptide bond can be established [9] : (i) via the interaction of the HLA-B*51:01 residue 62 with peptide position 2, requiring a hydrophilic residue there, typically Alanine (A), and a polar or negatively charged residue, typically Aspartic Acid (D), at position 1; (ii) with R62 sidechain facing the solvent, requiring co-occurrence at positions 1-2 of hydrophobic residues, typically Proline (P), at position 2). Inspection of the inputs to the 10th hidden unit (h 10 ), found by projecting peptides predicted by RBM-MHC as HLA-B*51:01-specific onto the corresponding weights (Methods, eq. 4), reveals a bimodal distribution, enabling the discrimination of the \"hydrophilic/charged\" pattern (i) from the \"hydrophobic\" pattern (ii), as recapitulated by the sequence logos. d, Correlation of experimental stability of SARS-CoV-2 epitopes [20] with scores from NetMHC (logK d -dissociation constant [nM]) and RBM trained on Binding Affinity (BA) and Mass Spectroscopy (MS) data. e, Score percentiles (relative to all SARS-CoV-2 9-mers peptides) of homologs of dominant SARS-CoV epitopes.

For this second step, we consider the fraction of data for which we have labels (the same used for training the HLA-I classifier) and we estimate from them a PWM for each HLA type, in such a way as to obtain a set of reference motifs. We next estimate the PWM of each cluster and we label the cluster with the HLA association of the reference motif that minimizes the difference to the cluster PWM. Note that this mapping could give the same HLA type associated to several clusters and other HLA types not associated to any cluster, indicating a poor classification performance.",

Our alignment routine consists of first building a reference profile of length 9 by estimating the PWM describing the subset of 9-mers in the dataset of interest. Next we align the other peptides to this profile by the insertion of a gap in 8-mers and deletions in 10-11 mers, using the functions seqprofile and profalign (with default options) of the Matlab Bioinformatics Toolbox (release R2018b). Typical samples of interest pool together peptides of different binding specificity to HLA-I, each of these being characterized by well defined sequence motifs. On one hand, the best alignment for each peptide needs to be based on the PWM of 9-mers sharing the same HLA preference, which best describes the respective sequence motif. On the other hand, identifying these subsamples sharing the same specificity requires first identifying the motif, therefore we propose an iterative procedure where the sequence alignment is re-iterated after training the classifier in such a way that the steps of classification and alignment inform each other. Peptides of core length 9 do not need to be re-aligned. The overall workflow with peptides of length 8-11 is as follows:",

A set of 8-11-mer peptides documented with HLA-A*02:01 restriction in the Immune Epitope Database (IEDB, last release [10] ), for a total of 5607 monoallelic-source sequences filtered as outlined below, was used to train the HLA-A*02:01specific RBM presentation model. We randomly selected a subset with the 80% of these sequences as training dataset and kept the remaining 20% as test set to evaluate the model's predictions in terms of probabilistic scores of presentation (Fig. 1c) . We randomly selected 5000 peptides from the human proteome (as in UniProt database [27] ) with length distribution matching the one of presented peptides to serve as a set of peptides predominantly not presented on the cell surface (\"generic\"). For motif reconstruction, we considered 10 \"synthetic-individual\" datasets of antigens with known HLA-I specificity to assess the RBM-MHC classification performance by comparing RBM-MHC predictions against the known HLA-I specificity. These datasets are built by collecting all IEDB antigens associated to 2 haplotypes, i.e. combinations of an A, a B, a C allele observed to co-occur in the human population (see Supplementary Table 1 ) in such a way as to preserve linkage. Information on haplotypes co-occurrence was found at allelefrequencies.net [28] . We prioritized HLA-specific peptides from monoallelic sources [4] in such a way that the assignment of HLA-binding specificity is unambiguous and does not rely on additional in silico predictions. The search was performed as follows. The full set of curated HLA-I ligands was downloaded from IEDB (file mhc_ligand_full.csv from http://www.iedb.org/database_export_v3.php, accessed in September 2019). We searched in IEDB for linear, human peptides of length 8-11 residues (as most of the HLA-I presented peptides have a length in this range). We looked for peptides eluted from cells (field in IEDB file Assay Group = \"ligand presentation\") and detected by mass spectrometry techniques (field Method/Technique = \"cellular MHC/mass spectrometry\", \"mass spectrometry\", \"secreted MHC/mass spectrometry\"). Among these data, we set the field Allele Evidence Code (describing the basis upon which the HLA-I assignment is made) to the most stringent option, \"Single allele present\". This definition indicates that antigen presenting cells are known to only express a single HLA-I molecule, as is the case for monoallelic cell lines [4, 5] . If for a given allele we found less than a minimal number (set to 300) of sequences among monoallelic-source data, we extended the search to peptides with evidence code \"Allele Specific Purification\", since this procedure attaches greater confidence to the HLA assignment than its inference by in silico methods. Only for one allele (HLA-B*39:01) we did extend the search to all other MS data, thus including the evidence code \"Inferred by motif or alleles present\". To apply the RBM-MHC method to patient-derived immunopeptidomic datasets, when we cannot retrieve a HLA annotation in IEDB for the 10% of their peptides, we add to each of them labeled peptides for the 6 HLA-I (given by the patient's HLA typing) collected from IEDB as above. The RBM-MHC training set is this minimally extended dataset, to guide the learning of the HLA-I classifier by the labeled peptides, whose predictions are used to reconstruct HLA-I motifs in the original dataset. We have not attempted to identify motifs on dataset Mel5 from [19] as the patient's HLA typing was uncomplete (lacking the HLA-C alleles).",

[14] , i.e. filtered by expression levels and by their affinity, estimated with NetMHCpan3.0 [30] , to the allele HLA*A:02:01 (known to expressed in these cell lines). The number of missense mutations is as follows: 93 (A375), 60 (SKOV3), 39 (A2780), 22 (OV90), 28 (HeLa), resulting in 38 possible peptides of length 8-11 containing each of them. We used the RBM log-likelihood L RBM as probabilistic score of presentation by HLA*A:02:01 to assign to all 8-11 residue long mutated peptides. Since the MS database for the 5 cancer lines produced by Ref. [14] was annotated by comparison to the consensus human proteome, it contained only wildtype peptides whose mutated version was in the list of putative neoantigens.

For some of these neoantigens, immunogenicity was also validated in vitro by identification of neoantigen-specific T-cell responses. Their HLA association was predicted by NetMHC. The prediction was to a large extent confirmed by in vitro validation of immunogenicity, which relied on antigen presenting cells that were positive to the predicted HLA-I. As the 11 neoantigens are 9-10 residues long, following Ref. [8] we considered 9-mer and 10-mer peptides overlapping the missense mutations observed in the patient's WES, which resulted in a list of thousands of putative neoantigens (see Supplementary Table  2 ). The RBM-MHC training set per se can thus take into account only 9-10 mers from patients' samples; patients' neoantigens to validate were not included in the training dataset.

MixMHCp [8, 9] models probabilistically data by a mixture of independent models, thus it describes each sequence by a vector of \"responsibilities\", describing the probabilities to belong to each cluster (i.e. HLA-I class). NetMHC-pan4.0 [7] predicts peptide binding values from either the training on eluted data (EL option) or the binding affinity data (BA option) and it estimates from these values presentation scores and percentile rank scores. Low values of percentile rank define binders (following the authors' recommendations, peptides with percentile rank <2% and <0.5% are considered HLA-I weak and strong binders respectively). Having built the samples from MS data, we considered NetMHC predictions from the EL option (NetMHCpan4.0-EL). We compare the N c = 6 HLA-I classes by pairs. We consider the probability of belonging to a certain class that each method would assign to \"positives\" of that class (peptides binding to the respective HLA-I allele) and \"negatives\" (peptides binding to other alleles): when the classification performance is good, the former has values close to one, the latter has values close to zero. Varying the threshold between false positive and false negative distributions, we build the ROC curve. We take the area under the ROC curve (AUC) as measure of the ability to discriminate the two classes (AUC = 1 means perfect discrimination, AUC = 0.5 means chance). To obtain one cumulative indicator, we average over the AUCs of these pairwise comparisons.

In this way, when comparing peptides of different classes two by two, we can count true positives of classification (t p), false positives ( f p), true negatives (tn) and false negatives ( f n). Once these quantities are defined, additional classification performance indicators are: Accuracy=(t p + tn)/(t p + f p + tn + f n), Precision=t p/(t p + f p), Specificity=tn/(tn + f p), Sensitivity=t p/(t p + f n). MixMHCp [8, 9] was run using default options, which include an additional \"trash cluster\". When measuring these classification performance indicators, the assignment to the trash cluster is considered among the false negatives. The comparison of classification performance as measured by these indicators is shown in Supplementary Fig. 7 .",

Here, we prioritized training datasets from binding assays in IEDB (see above) to customize the presentation score toward the identification of high-affinity ligands. These types of data are almost absent for the 4 HLA-C mentioned, and in these cases models were learned from MS data only but a re-weighting of frequencies, aimed at correcting for MS biases in detection, was applied (see Supplementary Note). All peptides tested for binding to a given HLA-I in Ref. [20] were scored by the corresponding RBM model (see Fig. 2d , where, as a comparison, results achieved by training all RBMs on MS data with re-weigthing are also reported).

The probability of presentation P(v) inferred by the RBM consists of potentials g i (v i ), describing single-site amino acid conservation, and terms describing the co-occurrence of motifs through the weights w i\u00b5 (v). In the first row, we consider a IEDB, MS-based dataset of antigens specific to one allele, HLA-B*51:01 (monoallelic dataset). A RBM model is trained on these data (chosen with 5 hidden units and \u03bb 2 1 = 0.1, to enhance weights' interpretability, see Supplementary Fig. 3 ). With data of the same HLA-I type, the binding motif is essentially captured by conservation alone (logo representation of e \u2211i(gi(vi)) , central column). Weights and hidden units embed additional data features (right column). Hidden unit 1 h 1 encodes the multiple binding modes of HLA-B*51:01 antigens discussed in [2] (see also Fig. 2c) : the sequence property \"hydrophilic/charge\" has a positive projection on W 1 (and hence positive inputs to h 1 ) while the pattern \"hydrophobic\" has a negative one. In the second row, we train a RBM (10 hidden units and \u03bb 2 1 = 0.1) on a bi-allelic dataset, i.e. where we added to the monoallelic dataset IEDB, MS-derived antigen sequences specific to the allele HLA-A*03:01 (a minimal example of a sample mixing antigens of different specificities). In this setting: (i) overall conservation does not allow discrimination of HLA-I motifs (central column), for which the RBM data representation through weights and inputs to hidden units is necessary; (ii) this representation is robust with respect to the monoallelic case. To illustrate this, we have selected sets W 5 and W 6 (right column). They distinguish HLA-B*51:01 antigens with sequence patterns underlying alternative binding modes (pattern \"hydrophilic/charge\" has significant, negative projection on W 5 and is kept separate from pattern \"hydrophobic\", with a significant, positive projection on the other set of weights, W 6 ). HLA-B*51:01 sequence patterns are represented as mutually exclusive with respect to the sequence motif characteristic of HLA-A*03:01 (weights of opposite sign). As a result, antigens of different HLA-I types are clearly partitioned into 2 clusters in the space of inputs to h 5 and h 6 . The 2 subclusters in the HLA-B*51:01 one (blue points) correspond to its alternative binding modes. As conserved sites at position 9 play a role in representing HLA-B*51:01 vs HLA-A*03:01 specificity but not in discriminating HLA-B*51:01 binding modes, only in this bi-allelic case weights at that position have a non-negligible value.",

Test of the re-weighting procedure in a RBM model for presentation by HLA-A*01:01 trained on a set of MS data in IEDB (with ligand length in the range of 8-11 residues). b: Distribution of weights \u03b1s for ligands in the training dataset with and without C/W. c: Distribution of differences of presentation log-likelihoods defined as \u2206L RBM (v) = L RBM (v) \u2212 L RBM val , where L RBM (v) = logP(v), \u00b7 val stands for the average over the full validation dataset and v are sequences in the latter containing C/W. The 3 curves correspond to choosing either P = P MS (from the RBM model trained on MS data without re-weighting), or P = P MS reweight (from the RBM model trained on MS data with re-weighting) or P = P non\u2212MS (from the RBM model trained on data obtained by techniques different from MS). d: Effect of re-weighting applied to the RBM model for presentation by HLA-A*02:01 of Figs. 1c-d (trained on IEDB, monoallelic MS-detected ligands of length 8-11 residues). Experimentally validated immunogenic peptides from T-cell recognition assays containing C/W (FIDSYICQV from [8] , SLWGGDVVL and FTWEGLYNV from [9] ) are assigned an equal or higher RBM presentation score by the re-weighted model (P MS reweight ) compared to the one without re-weighting (P MS ). Thanks to re-weighting, score percentiles, relative to the score distribution of the 5000 generic peptides considered in Figs. 1c-d, are all brought above 95%. RBM generative performance guided by the HLA-I classifier. The RBM model is generative. As it is based on fitting an entire probability distribution to a given dataset, sampling from this distribution allows one to generate new candidate antigens. The binding specificity to HLA-I of such generated sequences can be controlled by conditioning (fixing) the RBM probability on the values of inputs to hidden units coding for the desired specificity. The search for these values is guided by the HLA-I classifier. This procedure directly builds on the idea of sampling while conditioning on structural, functional, phylogenetic features emerging in RBM representations of protein families [1] . Schematically, the steps of this HLA-specific sampling are as follows: 1. we select a HLA-I class c (e.g. c = HLA-A*01:01) and we find I o such that\u0177 c (I o ) is close to 1 (that is, there is high confidence of class c prediction); 2. we estimate h o = h from the conditional probability P(h|I o ) and we sample new sequences v from the probability of observed sequences conditioned on h o , P(v|h = h o ); 3. to further explore the region encoding for the specificity to HLA-I class c, we randomly move from I o to I n = I o + \u03b4 I (\u03b4 Is drawn from a Gaussian N (0, \u03c3 )); 4. we accept the move with a probability \u03c0 \u223c exp (\u2212\u03b2 (e n \u2212 e o )), where e n = \u2212log(\u0177 c (I n )) and e o = \u2212log(\u0177 c (I o )). The parameter \u03b2 (akin to an inverse temperature in physics) basically controls how stringent the selection for sequences predicted in class c with a high probability is. 5. We set I o = I n to proceed with new moves as in step 3. Every arbitrary amount of moves, we generate new configurations by conditional sampling as in step 2. Supplementary Fig. 14a shows examples of I n values (2 of its components for simplicity) covered in this search with \u03b2 = 50 and \u03c3 = 0.01 (dark red points). By this sampling procedure, we generate samples of artificial peptides that would be predicted to be presentable and specifically presented by the selected HLA-I protein complex. Such samples explore a broad diversity of peptides, that are typically 3-4 mutations away from the closest natural ones (Supplementary Fig. 14b ) while preserving the profile of amino acid abundances constrained by a given binding specificity ( Supplementary Fig. 14c ). Fig. 1b . Inputs for antigen sequences with HLA-A*01:01 restriction (points in light red color) mark a region encoding for this binding specificity. We explore more systematically this region by making small, stochastic moves in this space (points in dark, red color) and by accepting them only if the classifier would predict with high confidence that the sampled antigens specifically bind to HLA-A*01:01 (see text). In this example, every 100 steps we condition on the current values of inputs to hidden units and sample 1000 configurations for a total of M g = 11000 generated sequences. b: Distribution of the diversity of the generated sequences with the selected HLA-A*01:01 specificity, quantified as number of mutations away from the closest natural sequence of the same specificity. c: Scatter plot comparing positional amino acid frequency of natural and generated antigen sequences with same binding specificity, HLA-A*01:01.",

Once the RBM model is learned with re-weighting (giving the probability P MS reweight ), the score assigned to these sequences is brought closer to the average value and in particular to overlap with the range of presentation score values that would be assigned by a RBM model (P non\u2212MS ) trained on IEDB data for the same HLA allele from techniques different from MS (i.e. data that do not underestimate the occurrence of C/W in presented antigens). The re-weighting scheme can also improve the ability of the RBM model to discriminate antigens containing C/W of validated immunogenicity from generic peptides, by assigning them presentation scores of higher rank. We show this in Supplementary Fig. 13d, where we consider a re-weighted version of the HLA-A*02:01-specific model of Figs. 1c-d in the main text. While there (as well as in the analysis of Figs. 1e and 2a-c) the re-weighting was not necessary, as we validated the model on the same type of data (MS-detected) as the training set (MS-based), in Supplementary Fig. 13d we show that the re-weigthing is useful for scoring by a MS-based model peptides from binding assays and that contain amino acids underdetected by MS",

The C/W frequency in presented antigens is therefore expected to be underestimated by MS, suggesting that ligands containing C/W, whose binding affinity to HLA-I could be successfully tested in vitro, would be missed by MS",

The RBM architecture consists of the layer of observed units vcorresponding to the antigen sequences to model -coupled to the layer of hidden units h by weights W . The HLA-I classifier has a fully connected network of weights X connecting the layer of inputs to hidden units I(v) (RBM data representations) to the output layer of HLA-I classes y c (light gray nodes) formulated in one-hot representation (e.g. HLA-I class 2 is encoded by a vector of zeros with the symbol 1 only at position 2).

RBM average log-likelihood on the training set (a) and on the validation set (b) as a function of the number of hidden units, for different values of the regularization \u03bb 2 1 .

The mutated residue in each neoantigen sequence is marked as a bold letter. All neoantigen candidates (whose number is reported in the header) were ranked according to the presentation scores assigned by RBM-MHC (see equation 9 in Methods) in decreasing order. RBM-MHC predictions are compared to the same ranking by the two unsupervised approaches, MixMHCp and RBM-km (both trained on the same single-patient dataset). For each method, we have highlighted in blue ranks in the top 1%, i.e. higher than the 99% of the full set of neoantigen candidates. This comparison shows that: the RBM-km attains a performance comparable to RBM-MHC (8/11 ranked among top 1%, expected HLA restriction systematically retrieved), emphasizing the key role of RBM modeling for predictive power; MixMHCp provides accurate predictions (4/11 times gives higher rank than RBM-MHC ) but in a less robust way, missing 2 neoantigens among the top 1% and 2 HLA-I restrictions that RBM-MHC and RBM-km assess well. The same ranks estimated by NetMHCpan4.0 and MixMHCpred, available respectively in [6, 7] (apart from the neoantigen GVYPMPGTQK, detected in a more recent analysis [4] ), are overall higher than RBM-MHC ones, largely due to training on large-scale, optimized datasets. However, NetMHCpan4.0 fails at placing in the top 1% the same 3 neoantigens for which the RBM-MHC fails, and so does MixMHCpred for 2 of them. Hence, the RBM-MHC bears the comparison to these methods, given that it is trained on a moderate-size, patient-derived dataset instead of a large-scale, optimized dataset as NetMHCpan4.0 and MixMHCpred.",

An important question is whether a RBM presentation model, trained on datasets obtained by mass spectrometry (MS), is able to properly score the probability of presentation of ligands that are less frequently detected by MS. The most evident case are ligands containing cysteine, an amino acid that can undergo chemical modifications by oxidation typically not included in standard MS searches. We introduce a procedure for re-weighting sequences as a general strategy to correct for biases in the training dataset, such as MS detection biases. We define a weight for each sequence v in the training set:where f MS denotes typical amino acid frequencies in MS (as can be estimated from IEDB data) while f back is a background amino acid frequency distribution that does not suffer from the same biases as the MS one. These weights \u03b1(v) are incorporated into the average log-likelihood to maximize during RBM training:",
