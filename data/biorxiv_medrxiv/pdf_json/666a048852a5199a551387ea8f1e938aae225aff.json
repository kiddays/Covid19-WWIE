Many clinical diagnostic laboratories rely on commercial platforms that provide integrated end-to-end solutions. While this provides established robust pipelines, there is a clear bottleneck in the supply of reagents given the current situation of extraordinary high demand. Some laboratories resort to implementing kit-free handling procedures, but many other small laboratories will not have the capacity to develop those and/or will perform manual handling of their samples. In order to provide multiple workflows for SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid detection we compared several commercially available RNA extraction methods: QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit (QIAGEN), the recently developed RNAdvance Blood (Beckman) and Mag-Bind Viral DNA/RNA 96 Kit (Omega Bio-tek). We also compared different 1-step RT-qPCR Master Mix brands: TaqMan\u2122 Fast Virus 1-Step Master Mix (ThermoFisher Scientific), qPCRBIO Probe 1-Step Go Lo-ROX (PCR Biosystems) and Luna\u00ae Universal Probe One-Step RT-qPCR Kit (NEB). We used the Centre for Disease Control (CDC) recommended primers that detect two regions of the viral N gene as well as those that detect the RdRP gene region as per Public Health England (PHE) guidelines (Charit\u00e9/WHO/PHE). Our data show that the RNA extraction methods provide similar results. Amongst the qPCR reagents tested, TaqMan\u2122 Fast Virus 1-Step Master Mix and Luna\u00ae Universal Probe One-",

To fight the exponential spread of SARS-CoV-2, measures of social distancing have been imposed in many countries worldwide. Initial results of these measures start to manifest in stagnant or dropping numbers of new infections. However, while preventative and therapeutic treatments for COVID-19 are developed, massive testing is required. Countries such as South Korea, Germany or Austria have been exemplary in their large testing efforts as well as their Track and Trace approach, and thus have been put forward as models for others to follow. Large scale PCR-based testing will determine who has detectable SARS-CoV-2 viral levels. This is particularly relevant in asymptomatic individuals and should also be central in implementing an 'exit strategy' plan.",

The UK government document \"Guidance for organisations to seek supporting the COVID-19 testing programme\" published on the 9 th of April 2020, by the Department of Health and Social Care, clearly welcomes academic institutions to increase testing capacities within the UK referred here as NHS-helper labs. However, due to global high demand of the kits and reagents used in the WHO (World Health Organization), CDC (Centre for Disease Control, US), ECDC (European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control) and PHE (Public Health England) ratified testing strategies, the NHS-helper labs are encouraged to use alternative strategies that will not interfere with the reagent demand of larger testing facilities. Moreover, helper laboratories can provide their research expertise and experimental validation of other kits enabling clinical labs to benefit from their results. We set out to perform this task.",

Figure 4A shows that the RT-qPCR reaction remains linear over a 100 000-fold dilution range. To ensure that low viral yields can be reliably detected with each one of these methods, we prepared serial dilutions of swab material from three different CPS donors in Hank's Balanced Salt Solution (HBSS) + 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA) since viral transport medium contains these only with the addition of amphotericin and gentamicin. Viral RNA was isolated from these diluted swabs with the three RNA isolation kits from Figure 2 . Figure  4B shows that all three kits recover viral RNA over a wide range of concentrations, with the N gene being reliably amplified with the Luna Master Mix and the N1 or N2 primer-probe sets.

Moreover, samples with high viral load pose a risk of infection for the handler. Most recommended viral inactivation protocols use a combination of guanidinium thiocyanate (GTC) and Triton X-100. However, GTC is currently on backorder in several countries and the use of chemical inactivation protocols implies opening of the swab sample. Recently, heat treatment of viral particles has been shown effective in inactivating SARS-CoV-2 [3] with 70\u00b0C 5min treatment rendering viral infectivity undetectable employing Vero-6 cells (limit of detection of TCID50 assay is 100 TCID50/mL). Moreover, the American Type Culture Collection provides heat inactivated SARS-CoV-2 (ATCC\u00ae VR-1986HK\u2122) employing 65\u00b0C for 30min and recommending BSL-1 for its handling [4] . We therefore assessed if heat treatment of nasopharyngeal swab-material constitutes a method of treating samples within their original unopened collection tubes without compromising RT-qPCR results. Data shown were obtained employing QIAamp RNA extraction. We increased the exposure times and carried out the experiments in our CL-3 laboratory, up to the point of chemical viral inactivation as acknowledged by the CDC, as a precaution, since we did not have this information when we initiated these experiments.",

We employed a dry metallic bead bath to heat the sample tubes, since water baths are not allowed in this setting due to the risk of spillage and complex decontamination in case of spillage. Our results show that none of the heat conditions altered the Ct values ( Figure 5C ). Both the N1 and N2 primer-probe sets gave reliable and near-identical amplification of viral RNA; however, we noticed that the RdRP primer-probe set failed to amplify viral samples with high Ct values. These results of high Ct values for RdRP were also observed when we used the MagMax kit (ThermoFisher Scientific) as an extra RNA extraction method (Supplementary Figure 1) . Comparison of the different primer-probe combination for RdRP rendered similar results (Supplementary Figure 2) and as previously shown [5] . This important finding should be considered when laboratories decide to rely only on one primer-probe set.",

We have also tested three alternative, commercially available one step RT-qPCR kits (FastVirus, Luna and PCRBio) with FastVirus and Luna showing better results but PCRBio also being also a good alternative. We have also assessed different recommended primerprobe sets (N1, N2, RdRP). We find that N1 and N2 primer-probe are more sensitive than RdRP. Finally, and possibly most importantly, we show that heat inactivation of virus within swab-material does not affect viral RNA detection and may be used to reduce the need for CL-3 laboratory where no closed automatization of the sample-extraction procedure is possible. Our pipeline can therefore be implemented in places that only have CL-2 facilities to help with diagnostic detection of SARS-CoV-2.",

Samples were vortexed and incubated at room temperature for 5 mins. 40 \u00b5l chloroform was added, samples vortexed and incubated for a further 5 mins. Samples were transferred to a CL-2 lab for further processing and spun at 12000g at 4\u00b0C for 10 mins. 100ul of the upper aqueous phase was then transferred to a 96-well plate, 50 \u00b5l 100% isopropanol added, and samples vortexed/shaken for 1 min.
