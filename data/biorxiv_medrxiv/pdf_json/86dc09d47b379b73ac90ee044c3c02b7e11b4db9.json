In this paper, we propose and test a methodology to estimate the daily effective reproduction number (R t ) through the lens of the Kalman Filter and Bayesian estimation. Moreover, we apply our method to data from the current COVID-19 pandemic in China, Italy, Japan, and South Korea. We correlate our findings with the implementation of control measures in each of these countries. Our results show that China, Italy, and South Korea have been able to reduce R t over time. We find significant heterogeneity in the way R t decreases across countries. For instance, China reduced R t from its peak to below one in 19 days, while South Korea achieved the same reduction in 12 days. In contrast, it has taken Italy almost a month to reach similar levels. We hypothesize this is related to how strict, enforceable, and comprehensive are the implemented policies.",

In this paper, we estimate the daily effective reproductive number (R t ) of COVID-19 using the Kalman filter and Bayesian estimation.

Human-contact dynamics, testing, model, and data reliance are factors constantly affecting the flow and the quality of the information available. Bayesian methods can partially overcome these challenges by continually updating the estimation as new information becomes available. Moreover, the use of the Kalman filter helps us to identify the evolution of the daily reproduction number accounting for the possibility of model error. 4, 5 The use of the Kalman filter to track the evolution of pandemics is not new. Other papers have done similar exercises for Ebola and AIDS/HIV. 6, 7 However, these were ex-post analysis, and to the best of our knowledge, this is the first real-time application of the method to COVID-19. With our approach, we provide a time-series for the estimated daily effective reproduction number for China, Italy, Japan, and Korea. \u2021 The priors for our estimation come from previous studies on the reproduction number for COVID-19. 3, 8, 9 We test the accuracy of our method by evaluating its performance using simulated data. Table 1 summarizes some of our results. We find that China, Italy, and South Korea have been able to reduce R t over time. Figure 1 shows there is a strong correlation between the implementation of control measures and the decrease of R t . However, there is heterogeneity in the decreasing path of R t across countries. For instance, China reduced R t from its peak to below one in 19 days. South Korea achieved the same reduction in 12 days, and it has taken Italy almost a month to reach similar levels. In contrast, Japan is the only country among the four analyzed, which displays an increasing trend over time. We hypothesize this is probably due to the lack of strict containment/control policies.",

This is an important assumption because: (1) If all the information is taken as given, we can borrow from the SIR model a single linear differential equation where R t is the only time-varying parameter; (2) If the model is linear and all noise is Gaussian, the Kalman filter will yield the best linear estimator for R t .

Equation (3) is called the state equation and describes the evolution of the unobserved state R t at any time. We assume that R t follows a martingale process that moves according to the gaussian innovation \u03b7 t . Both t and \u03b7 t are normally distributed with mean zero and variance \u03c3 2 and \u03c3 2 \u03b7 . To use the Kalman filter, we need to estimate \u03c3 2 and \u03c3 2 \u03b7 . To do so, we will break down the model in conditional densities from which we can sample iteratively (Gibbs sampling). 12 In the first step, conditional on \u03c3 2 and \u03c3 2 \u03b7 , the Kalman filter will infer the state vector R t . In the second step, conditional on the sequence of R t computed in the previous step, we take samples of \u03c3 2 and \u03c3 2 \u03b7 from their prior distributions. Once both steps are completed, we compute the Kalman smoother and proceed to the next iterations. A standard assumption is to choose Inverse-Gamma distributions as priors for \u03c3 2 and \u03c3 2 \u03b7 . In particular, we assume as prior for \u03c3 2 an Inverse-Gamma distribution with \u03c4 0 and \u03c9 as the shape and scale parameters. In its turn, the prior for \u03c3 2 \u03b7 is also an Inverse-Gamma distribution with \u03c4 0 and \u03a8 as shape and scale parameters. Regarding the filter, we also need to define initial values. In particular, we choose R 0 to be equal to the value estimated by Wang et al. (2020) . 9 For the variance of R t conditional on the information at t = 0, we choose the value of var \u00ee t st .

We find that, except for Japan, the estimated peak of R t was reached around the dates when authorities started implementing epidemiological control policies (figure 1). 13, 14 However, we show that there is some heterogeneity in the response of R t to quarantine or social distancing. For instance, as shown in table 3, China  (fig 1a) and Korea (1b) reduced the effective reproduction number below one in less than twenty days after enacting the policies. At the same time, Italy (1c) declared a nationwide lockdown on March 9th, 2020, and still, the R t remains above, although closer to one. 15 Figure 1d shows Japan's estimated R t , which displayed a decreasing trend in the days following the outbreak but had a change in trend around March 18th, 2020. During the first 12 days after the outbreak, the median R t was 2\u00b786 and then decreased to a minimum level of 1\u00b752 on March 17th. However, around the date the Tokyo 2020 Olympic games were canceled, the decreasing trend reverted, and the estimated R t jump to its current level of 3\u00b783. 16 This trend reversal contrasts sharply with the estimated evolution of R t for China, Korea, and Italy. Although it is challenging to identify causality, we think two hypotheses could explain this behavior. First, in contrast with the countries mentioned above, Japan's set of implemented measures to combat the pandemic does not include citywide lockdowns and strict social-distancing rules. Second, testing standards and capabilities could have changed over this time (we discussed a similar situation for China in the previous section), reveling important information that was missing before. It is worth noting that, as we will discuss in section 3.2, the Kalman filter does a good job of capturing trend changes. For instance, Chinese authorities announced on February 21st, 2020, a change in the accounting process of COVID-19 infections. This change implied a one time jump in new infections. 17 As can be seen in figure 1a , the filter captures the jump but then learns that most likely, it was noisy information and weights it off. This result constitutes a key advantage of the Kalman filter relative to other estimation methods. Instead of relying on the observer to 5 .

We calibrated the simulations to match the levels of contagion reported so far in the actual data. For each simulated pandemic, we randomly chose the initial level of infected people and the basic reproduction number, so our simulation matches realistic outbreaks. Next, we add a stochastic declining trend to the daily reproduction number R t . This negative trend starts between 15 and 25 days of the initial infection (also randomly selected), and its purpose is to simulate the implementation of an epidemic-control policy during the outbreak. We calibrate this policy effort to reduce (on average) the daily reproduction number to be less than one, between 40 to 60 days after the policy implementation. Once at this point, we let the random process to increase the R t again. Note: This graph illustrates the performance of the Kalman filter for a single simulated pandemic. The estimations reflect each of the four underestimation scenarios described in the text. The time-series labelled as \"actual\" depicts the pandemic's \"real\" value of the daily reproduction number. The time-series denoted as \"No Underestimation\" corresponds to the estimated R t when the model uses unbiased data. The series labelled as \"30% Underestimation\" and \"60% Underestimation\" correspond to the estimated daily reproduction number when the model's input was biased following the mentioned rates. Finally, the time-series denoted as \"Martingale Underestimation\" corresponds to the case where new infections are underestimated following a martingale process.

The series labelled \"no underestimation\" shows that the Kalman filter tracks well these dynamics, and, as more information becomes available, its accuracy improves significantly. In real life, however, concerns about testing and measuring errors affect data reliability and make tracking the evolution of epidemic outbreaks notoriously difficult. For instance, during the current COVID-19 pandemic, there has been ample evidence of underestimation in the number of infections and deaths caused by the disease. [18] [19] [20] To evaluate how our model behaves in the presence of data misreporting or underestimation, we design two different tests. First, we fed into the model data where the number of infections was downward biased at a constant rate. * Second, we assumed there was a random rate of underestimation. \u2020 Since the model's outcomes are posterior distributions of R t at each time t, we define the median value of each distribution as our main estimate. Table 4a shows the mean forecast error for each of the scenarios mentioned above. In general, we observe that choosing informative priors allow us to reduce the forecast error at any time horizon (See tables 7a, 7b and 7c in the appendix for comparison). In particular, we find the filter's estimates are less accurate during the first days of the simulation. However, as new information becomes available, the filter learns and update its * We divided this exercise into two parts: First, we assumed that new infections were underestimated, on average, by 30 percent. Second, we repeated the exercise with an average underestimation rate of 60 percent. \u2020 In this case, each day, the data underestimate new infections at a randomly selected rate. The rate followed a martingale process bounded by the interval [10%, 90%].",

Our methodology has several limitations. First, the model is as only as good as the inputs that it receives. Therefore, as shown in section 3.2, low-quality data can induce biased estimates. By using all the information available in the data, Bayesian estimation techniques help us to overcome this issue but, since the \"true\" source of bias in the observable data is unknown, it is best to interpret our results as lower-bound estimates. Second, our method is sensitive to the priors we choose for the estimation.
