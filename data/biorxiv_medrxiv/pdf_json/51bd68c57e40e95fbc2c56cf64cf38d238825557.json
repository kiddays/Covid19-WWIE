Where, the genetic algorithm was taken advantage to optimize the Dropout module, which is essential in neural networks so as to improve the performance of typical neural network models. The experiment results demonstrate that the proposed method shows excellent performance and strong practicability in judging pneumonia, and the application of advanced artificial intelligence technology in the field of medical imaging has broad prospects.",

According to the World Health Organization's survey of patients with colon cancer in the United States, the incidence and mortality of colon cancer in the United States have been declining for the past two decades, thanks to the colonoscopy screening vigorously promoted by the United States government. In the zero, one, and two stages of cancer, the cure rate and survival rate of patients are very high, and even in the third stage, the cure rate is as high as 72% (World Health Organization, 2019) . The diagnosis of a tumor relies heavily on medical imaging, including X-ray and CT imaging. Similarly, the determination of pneumonia can also help confirm the diagnosis through therapeutic impact technology.

The models used in the experiments in this paper are from the Inception and ResNet neural network families. InceptionV3, as the third edition of the Inception Deep Learning convolution architecture series, won the first place in the ImageNet Large-scale Visual Recognition Challenge (Jia et al., 2009 ). Inception V3 not only alleviates the problem of overfitting in the case of limited training data but also conducts a \"sparse connection\" structure to optimize computing resource allocation and memory footprint. The unique advantage of Inception V3 is that it can extract features in multiple dimensions and retain them. In the field of image recognition, the images in the dataset are very different. Some images have a wider feature distribution, so larger convolution kernels are suitable. For images with more cramped information distribution, smaller convolution kernels can play a better role in feature extraction. However, stacking large convolution kernels will consume many computing resources, and stacking small convolution kernels are prone to overfitting problems, so how to choose a convolution kernel is very important. Inception V3 uses parallel convolution kernels of different sizes to input pictures into these convolution kernels and then performs All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission.",

Although this neural network structure has a profound number of layers, the problem of deep network degradation and gradient disappearance is well solved by introducing residual units. Equation 1 and Equation 2 are the outputs of the traditional neural network and ResNet at the k-layer, respectively. ResNet's output at layer k adds identity information from the previous layer. The core idea of ResNet is that if the network develops in the direction of degraded performance, it can skip this layer, thereby retaining the best actual performance. ResNet guarantees that while increasing the depth of the network, it can not only converge but also prevent degradation to the greatest extent, thereby ensuring the effectiveness of each network layer. In the field of medical imaging, the research group of Wuhan University used ResNet to study the classification of human protein atlas images (Chang, 2019). The 2016 Deep Learning Methodology and Medical Image Analysis Symposium also exchanged ideas on the use of ResNet for medical image segmentation.

In order to prevent overfitting, the training automatically stopped. In Figure 6b , the final accuracy of the training set is very high, which is nearly 20% higher than that of the test set. In the subsequent parameters tuning, the overfitting phenomenon still exists. Therefore, it may be because, for the InceptionV3 model, the amount of data in the data pool is not large enough, which makes it impossible to describe the actual distribution of the problem, which leads to overfitting.

When the internal mechanism of the target problem is not completely clear, a value close to the optimal solution can be obtained by the genetic algorithm. In the computer-related field, there are many cases of \"non-zero is one\", so the application of the genetic algorithm is extensive and has strong robustness. In the experiments of this paper, by introducing the genetic algorithm, the dropout parameters adapted to the characteristics of the current network are obtained, thereby achieving better experimental results and improving the performance of the model. Dropout, as an essential part of neural networks, has been proven effective in a large number of experiments, but how to make Dropout adapt to different models is a problem that needs to be further studied. The current Dropout algorithm stops the work of some neurons randomly. Could different neurons be given different weights, and random selection can be changed to weighted selection, which can maximize the effect of the Dropout function? The difficulty of this algorithm lies in the setting of weights. Our preliminary consideration is that the feature matrix of each passing neuron has specific characteristics mathematically. Is it possible to combine a matrix into a number after feature transformation, and give this number as a weight to the neuron? Our future work will focus on it.",
