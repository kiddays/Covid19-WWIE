Medical editorials have suggested that angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) should not be given to people with arterial hypertension during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic because of a potential increased risk of worse clinical outcomes and that calcium channel blockers (CCBs) should be used as an alternative. Methods Using a cohort of 610 COVID-19 cases and 48,667 population-based controls from Zheijang, China we have tested the role of usage of ACEIs, ARBs, CCBs and other medications on risk and severity of COVID 19. Analyses were adjusted for age, sex and BMI and for presence of relevant comorbidities. Findings: Higher BMI, diabetes and cardio/ cerebrovascular disease are independent risk factors for the development of COVID-19. Individuals with hypertension taking CCBs had significantly increased risk [odds ratio (OR)= 1.67 (95% CI 1.2-2.9)) of manifesting symptoms of COVID-19 whereas those taking ARBs and diuretics had significantly lower disease risk (OR=0.24; 95%CI 0.17-0.34 and OR=0.32; 95%CI 0.19-0.57 respectively). Other antihypertensive drugs were not associated with increased .",

The clinical spectrum of SARS-CoV-2 infection appears to be wide, encompassing asymptomatic infection in 1%, mild upper respiratory tract illness with fever, fatigue, cough with or without sputum production in 81%, to more severe viral pneumonia in 14% with ground-glass opacity computed tomography of the chest leading to critical illness in 5% associated with respiratory failure, septic shock and/ or multi-organ failure. 2 Case-fatality rate ranges from 0.4% to 2.9% between different regions. 2 Large descriptive studies have reported type 2 diabetes in 7.4% -9.6% of patients with COVID-19 and hypertension in 15% as two of the most prevalent co-morbid conditions. 3, 4, 5 Moreover, diabetes (16.2%) and hypertension (23.7%) are highly prevalent among those with severe manifestations. 3 Of patients admitted to intensive care unit, 22% of those who died had diabetes. 6 None of these studies assessed the effect of antihypertensive or antidiabetic medications on COVID-19.",

There is an ongoing debate as to whether and how the interaction between the virus, hypertension and ACE2 may influence the manifestations of COVID- 19. 11,12,13 Concerns have been raised that angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors .

Therefore, trials of losartan as a treatment for Covid-19 are underway enrolling patients who have not previously received treatment with ACEIs or ARBs. 15 We have investigated whether any of the antihypertensive and antidiabetic medications affected either the development and/ or severity of COVID-19 using a multi-center cohort of 610 patients with COVID-19 and 48,667 population-based control subjects from Zhejiang province, China.",

One study including 4792 hospitalised pneumonia (bacterial and viral) case, showed increased incidence of major cardiovascular events among those who were on CCBs, betablockers or corticosteroids. 30 Impaired induction of antiviral type 1 interferon response to a range of respiratory viruses has been well described in association with corticosteroids and may also apply in the context of COVID-19 explaining association of these drugs with the severity of infection in our cohort. 31, 32 Hypertension was a strong risk factor for the development of the severe and critical forms of COVID-19 independently of antihypertensive therapy.
