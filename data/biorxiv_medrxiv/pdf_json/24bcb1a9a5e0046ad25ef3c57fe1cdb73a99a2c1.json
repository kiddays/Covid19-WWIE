CHO-expressed S1-Fc protein is very immunogenic in various animals and can rapidly induce strong antibody production 2. S1-Fc protein solicits strong neutralizing activities against live virus 3. Stable CHO cell line expressing 50 mg/L of S1-Fc and a 3,000 L Bioreactor can produce 3 million doses of human COVID-19 vaccine every 10 days, making it an accessible and affordable option for worldwide vaccination",

In this study, we examined the immunogenicity of CHO-expressed recombinant SARS-CoV-2 S1-Fc fusion protein in mice, rabbits, and monkeys as a potential candidate for a COVID-19 vaccine. We demonstrate that the S1-Fc fusion protein is extremely immunogenic, as evidenced by strong antibody titers observed by day 7. Strong virus neutralizing activity was observed on day 14 in rabbits immunized with the S1-Fc fusion protein using a pseudovirus neutralization assay. Most importantly, in less than 20 days and three injections of the S1-Fc fusion protein, two monkeys developed higher virus neutralizing titers than a recovered COVID-19 patient in a live SARS-CoV-2 infection assay. Our data strongly suggests that the CHO-expressed SARS-CoV-2 S1-Fc recombinant protein could be a strong candidate for vaccine development against COVID-19.",

In four short months, the virus has caused a global pandemic, with over 2,000,000 confirmed cases and over 126,000 deaths worldwide. As a novel coronavirus with no effective treatments or drugs currently available, a vaccine is in dire need of development. Several broad approaches to the development of a COVID-19 vaccine have emerged, including DNA vaccines, RNA vaccines, viral vector vaccines, recombinant subunit vaccines, and dead viral preparations [6] . Among these, an RNA vaccine from Moderna was the first to reach human trials in early March in the US, followed by Cansino's adenoviral vector vaccine which began human trials in China later in the same month.",

The spike protein has a total of 1,273 amino acids, which can be divided into two major domains according to their structures and functions [7, 9] . The first half is the S1 protein, which contains the RBD sequence and is located at the N-terminus of the spike protein [7, 10, 11] . The second half is the S2, serving as a trimeric structure that supports the S1 receptor binding site and has a fusion bundle which protrudes out into the host cell's membrane after it is triggered by the S1 coming into contact with ACE II [9, 11, 12] . Due to the fact that most of the neutralizing epitopes are located within the S1 region, proteins containing the S1 region, the RBD, or even a trimeric approach to the S1+S2 have been considered as candidates for .

The captured antibodies were probed with HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies. After final washes, HRP substrate TMB solution (Beijing Kwinbon, China) was added and absorbencies were measured at 450nm with a microplate reader. Pseudovirus neutralization assay HEK 293T cells and ACE2-transfected HEK 293T cells (ACE2-293T) were cultured in DMEM (Gibco, USA) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS, Gibco), 50 U/ml penicillin (Gibco) and 50\u03bcg/ml streptomycin (Gibco) at 37 o C with 5% CO2. HEK 293T cells were co-transfected with 10\u03bcg of a plasmid encoding SARS-CoV-2 S protein and 10\u03bcg of an env-deficient, luciferase-expressing HIV vector (pNL4-3.luc.RE) using Lipofectamine 2000 reagents (Life Technologies, USA). After 48 h, pseudovirus-containing culture supernatants were collected, filtered cells were seeded in 96-well plates at one day prior to infection. Heatinactivated serum samples were 3-fold serially diluted and incubated with 200 TCID50 pseudoviruses for 1 h at 37\u00b0C. The mixtures were then used to infect ACE2-293T cells in triplicate. Following 12 h infection, wells were replenished with fresh medium and the luciferase activities of cells were determined 48 h later. Cells were lysed with lysis buffer (Glo-lysis buffer, Promega), followed by addition of luciferase substrate (Bright-Glo luciferase assay substrate, Promega). Luciferase activity was measured using a GloMax 96 microplate luminometer (Promega) and wells producing relative luminescence units (RLU) above three times of the mean background value were defined as positive. The 50% neutralization titer was calculated by probit analysis using the SPSS software.",
