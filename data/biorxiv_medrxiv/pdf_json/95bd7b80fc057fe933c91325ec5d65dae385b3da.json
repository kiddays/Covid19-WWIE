Therefore the real \"zero\" patient could get infection in October-November, 2019 and probably had no connection with the Wuhan fish market. Chinese authorities notified WHO about the epidemic outbreak only on January 3, 2020 (see [18] ). This delay and obstacles to the dissemination of truthful information (an example is doctor Li Wenliang ) has led to tragic consequences in Europe and other parts of the world. SIR curves could be useful to estimate the number of persons who are still spreading the infection, so known \"hidden\" patients (see green lines in Figs. 1-6) . These information could be useful to plan the relaxation of quarantine measures. If medical and other services are able to quickly isolate persons who have contacted, for example, with 100 \"hidden\" patients, then there is no need to wait until the number of patients on the green curve reaches the value of unity. On the other hand, such attenuations may extend the time of occurrence of new cases and the number of deaths. A compromise between medicine and economic interests must be found here.",

This information may be useful to regulate the quarantine activities and to predict the medical and economic consequences of the pandemic. Unfortunately, the number of patients in Europe already exceeds one million. The risk of catching the infection will persist until at least mid-August, 2020. Such fatal consequences could have been avoided if timely and truthful information came from China.",

Therefore, to find the optimal values of parameters N and \uf06e , we have to find the maximum of the correlation coefficient. To compare the reliability of different predictions (with different values of n) it is useful to use the ratio / (1, 2) C F F n\uf02d at fixed significance level, [15]. We will use the level 0.001; corresponding values (1, 2) C F n\uf02d can be taken from [14]. The most reliable prediction yields the highest / (1, 2) C F F n\uf02d ratio.",

The second prediction for this country has lower value of / (1, 2) C F F n\uf02d in comparison with the first one (seeTables 3 and 5), but for the first prediction the deviations are even larger. Probably the final size and the duration of the epidemic in Spain have to be re-estimated after obtaining new data. The V and R curves are very close in Fig. 5. It means that the time of spreading infection in Germany is very short (in comparison, for example, with Moldova, see Fig. 6). SIR model allows calculating the average time of spreading infection 1/ \uf072 . For Germany this value could be estimated as 0.54 days; for Austria and France approximately 0.8 days; for Italy and Spain -1.5 days and 3.2 days for the Republic of Moldova ( see",
