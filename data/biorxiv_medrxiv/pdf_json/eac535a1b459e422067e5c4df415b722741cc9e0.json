Similarly, the number of patients with onset date t-2 and whose onset dates were not available was estimated as f(2)Nt. Therefore, the total number of patients whose onset date were not available, given an onset date of s, was estimated as \u03a3 k=1 f(k)Ns+k for a long time passed from s. Moreover, the reporting delay for published data from MHLW might be considerable. In other words, if s+k was larger than that in the current period t, then s+k represents the future for period t: thus Ns+k was not observable.
