Thus, defining novel phospho-Rab interacting partners is critical to our understanding of the molecular basis of LRRK2 pathogenesis. RILPL2 binds with strong preference to LRRK2-phosphorylated Rab8A and Rab10. RILPL2 is a binding partner of the motor protein and Rab effector, Myosin Va. We show here that the globular tail domain of Myosin Va also contains a high affinity binding site for LRRK2-phosphorylated Rab10, and certain tissue-specific Myosin Va isoforms strongly prefer to bind phosphorylated Rab10. In the presence of pathogenic LRRK2, RILPL2 relocalizes to the peri-centriolar region in a phosphoRab10-and Myosin Vadependent manner. In the absence of phosphoRab10, expression of RILPL2 or depletion of Myosin Va increase centriolar RILPL2 levels, and either condition is sufficient to block ciliogenesis in RPE cells. These experiments show that LRRK2 generated phosphoRab10 dramatically redistributes Myosin Va-RILPL2 complexes to the mother centriole, which may sequester Myosin Va and RILPL2 in a manner that blocks their normal roles in ciliogenesis.",

Most of these astrocytes contain Arl13b + primary cilia, and endogenous RILPL2 was detected at low levels throughout the cytoplasm and also at the base of these cilia (Fig. 1A) . Cultured cell lines including hTERT-RPE cells yielded only weak endogenous RILPL2 staining, however upon exogenous expression, HA-RILPL2 displayed a diffuse, cytoplasmic localization (see below). After 2 hours of serum starvation to induce primary cilia formation, a small amount of HA-RILPL2 was detected adjacent to the mother centriole, identified by distal appendage protein CEP164, centriolar cap protein CP110 or the ciliary vesicle marker, EHD1 (Fig. 1B) ; partial RILPL2 re-localization upon serum withdrawal was observed in >50% of the transfected cells ( Fig. 1C) .",

We therefore explored the relationship between RILPL2 expression and pRab10 distribution. In cells expressing R1441G LRRK2 to generate pRab10, RILPL2 was cytosolic (Red, Fig. 3A ) and a fraction (~20%) was concentrated in the peri-centriolar region with pRab10 (Green, Figs. 3A, B). pRab10 was significantly more concentrated in the centriolar region than RILPL2 under these conditions. Upon co-transfection in control cells, RILPL2 and MyoVa showed minimal colocalization that was limited to a few distinct puncta, and most RILPL2 protein was cytosolic (Fig. 3C ).",

Figure 5A diagrams the domain structure of Myosin V proteins. The N-terminal motor domain is followed by a series of IQ motifs and a set of variably spliced exons. At the Cterminus, the MyoVa globular tail domain (GTD) can interact with Rab3A (Wollert et al, 2011 ), Rab11 (Roland et al, 2009 Lindsay et al, 2013; Pylypenko et al, 2013 Pylypenko et al, , 2016 and with Rab27A via the Slac2/Melanophilin adaptor (Fukuda et al, 2002; Hume et al, 2002; Wei et al, 2013) in different cell types. Importantly, Exon D that is conserved in all Myosin Vs contains a binding site for Rab10 (Roland et al, 2009) . Exon D-containing forms of MyoVa are expressed broadly, but not in brain or endocrine/neuroendocrine cells (Seperack et al, 1995; Roland et al, 2009) . We therefore created a MyoVa truncation construct that deletes Exon D (MyoVa-\u0394D lacking amino acids 1320-1345) or enables expression of the GTD alone (residues 1421 to 1880; Fig. 5A ).",

In contrast, Exon D-deleted MyoVa (MyoVa-\u0394D) showed much less colocalization with Figs. 5C, E) . Surprisingly, expression of R1441G pathogenic LRRK2 relocalized both MyoVa-FL (Fig. 4C ) and the MyoVa-\u0394D to perinuclear membrane structures positive for pRab10 (Fig. 5D ). Quantitation of colocalization revealed that MyoVa colocalized with pRab10 to almost the same extent, with or without Exon D (Fig. 5E ). Importantly, even the normally diffuse GTD (Fig. 5B ) redistributed to pericentriolar, pRab10 + membranes ( Fig. 5F ): 35% of total MyoVa GTD colocalized with pRab10, while ~80% of pRab10 co-localized with GTD (Fig. 5G) . These values match closely the extent of RILPL2 relocalization seen in earlier experiments (Fig. 3) .",

As shown in Fig. 6 , full length MyoVa-mCherry bound both Rab10 and pRab10; binding of both forms decreased in the presence of MLi-2 LRRK2 inhibitor, suggesting that pRab10 was a significant contributor to MyoVa binding. Similarly, MyoVa-\u0394D lacking the D exon-Rab10 binding site still bound roughly the same amount of pRab10 and less total Rab10 protein (Figs. 6A,B) . These experiments strongly suggest that MyoVa-\u0394D contains an additional binding site with preference for pRab10. Indeed, similar analysis of binding to the GTD domain in cell .

These data are consistent with pRab10 binding both RILPL2 and MyoVa, perhaps forming a ternary complex. Since RILPL2 can dimerize (Wei et al, 2013; Waschb\u00fcsch et al, 2020) , it is possible that each half of the dimer engages either MyoVa or pRab10 or both. Alternatively, pRab10 may enhance the ability of MyoVa to bind RILPL2.",

As shown in Figure 9D , fewer cells expressing RILPL2 lost CP110 from their mother centrioles, indicating that RILPL2 expression inhibits ciliogenesis at an early stage, upstream of TTBK2. CP110 also failed to be released from the mother centriole in MyoVadepleted cells within 2 hours of serum starvation (Fig. 9D ), a condition that leads to redistribution of RILPL2 to the mother centriole ( Figure 2C ,D).",

This was unexpected, because pRab10 could have easily influenced MyoVa localization indirectly via RILPL2 binding. The globular tail domain of MyoVa is a versatile cargo adaptor with independent binding sites for RILPL2, Rab11A, Rab3A and melanophilin. Future experiments will determine the precise interface between pRab10 and MyoVa and whether or not pRab10 binding precludes interaction with additional binding partners. That MyoVa is a Rab11 effector suggests that it will function as part of the Rab11:Rab8 cascade that is an important part of the early steps of cilia formation (Kn\u00f6dler et al, 2010; Franco et al, 2014) .

Interestingly, all of these proteins are implicated in some way in the normal process of ciliogenesis and all become clustered around the mother centriole in cells expressing pathogenic LRRK2 kinase that are blocked in ciliogenesis. Are any of these components more important than another in regulating cilia formation? In our previous work, we showed that RILPL1 and Rab10 are essential components of the LRRK2-mediated, ciliogenesis blockade (Dhekne et al, 2018) . Here we show that loss of RILPL2 has no consequence for cilia formation, while RILPL1 depletion significantly enhances cilia formation. According to mapofthecell.biochem.mpg.de, RILPL1 is present at 72,522 copies per HeLa cell and 98% cytosolic, compared with 45,719 copies of MyoVa, which fractionates most significantly with endosomal markers (Itzhak et al, 2016) . However, RILPL2 was below detection in this tour de force mass spectrometry experiment (Itzhak et al, 2016) . Similarly, the ratio of RILPL2 to RILPL1 is quite variable across tissues (pax-db.org) and cell lines and thus differences in the contributions of RILPL1 and RILPL2 to ciliogenesis blockade may reflect their relative abundance in different cell types. Unlike RILPL2, RILPL1 does not bind MyoVa. As described herein, any role for RILPL2 in blocking ciliogenesis likely requires MyoVa participation since it so significantly altered RILPL2's cellular distribution.",

For monitoring CP110 release, RPE cells were serum starved for 1h. Cultures of primary rat astrocytes were obtained by antibody panning from rat pups as described (Foo et al, 2011; Dhekne et al, 2018) . In brief, six to ten postnatal Sprague-Dawley rat cortices were mechanically and enzymatically dissociated to produce single cells. They were passed over successive, antibody-coated negative panning plates to rid the suspension of microglia, endothelial cells, and oligodendrocyte precursor cells before selecting for astrocytes with an anti-ITGB5-coated plate. Astrocytes that attached to the anti-ITGB5coated plate were trypsinized and plated onto poly-D lysine coated ACLAR coverslips. Cells were incubated at 37\u00b0C with 10% CO2 and 90% O2 for one to three weeks.",

Reactions were stopped at indicated time points by addition of 2X sample buffer and boiling for 5 min. The reaction mixture (~150ng of Rab10) was loaded on 12% polyacrylamide gel. Samples were detected with anti-Rab10 and anti-pRab10 antibodies as indicated. Bottom, quantification of pRab10/ Rab10 signal. (B) As mentioned above, Purified Rab10 Q63L and Mst3 were incubated together and supplemented \u00b1 2 mM ATP. Reactions were stopped, loaded on 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and analyzed as in A. (C) Purified Rab10-Q63L was mixed with purified Mst3 in reaction buffer as indicated and phosphorylated at 27\u00b0C for 2h. The reaction mixture (~200-250ng of Rab10) was loaded onto a Phostag gel (10% gel with 40\u00b5M Phostag, 80\u00b5M MnCl 2 ) and transferred onto nitrocellulose membrane after EDTA washes and probed with anti-Rab10 antibody. Two separate Phostag gels are shown. (D) Schematic of pRab10 phosphorylation, binding conditions and MST experiments. In +ATP condition, Rab10 QL and Mst3 are incubated for 2 h at 27\u00b0C. Pre-spun NHS-Red Labeled GTD (final 100nM) is then added to serially diluted pRab10 QL reaction mixture and incubated for 30 min in the dark at 25\u00b0C before MST is started (top). In -ATP condition, the reaction mixture of Rab10 QL and Mst3 are serially diluted, and NHS-red labeled GTD (final 100nM) is added immediately. The samples are incubated for 30min in the dark at 25\u00b0C before MST measurements are started. In all phosphorylation reactions, final concentrations of Rab10 and Mst3 were 20\u00b5M and 7\u00b5M respectively. hTERT-RPE cells were transfected with HA-RILPL2 or mock transfected with lipofectamine and 24h later, serum starved overnight to initiate ciliogenesis. Cells were fixed with ice cold -20\u00b0C methanol for 2min and co-stained with rabbit anti-HA (green) or mouse anti-Arl13b (red). Arrow indicates the presence of an Arl13b + cilium. Dotted lines indicate cell outlines. Bar, 10 \u00b5m. (B) Quantitation of cells with cilia \u00b1 HA-RILPL2. Error bars represent SEM from two experiments, each with >25 cells per condition.

            "text": "Our experiments indicate that MyoVa lacking exon D essentially binds only to phosphorylated Rab10 protein. Because expression of MyoVa lacking exons D and F is a primary mode of regulation for MyoVa in these cell types. Thus, the RH homology domain proteins RILPL1, RILPL2, JIP3 and JIP4 increase their binding to Rab10 upon LRRK2 phosphorylation, while MyoVa lacking exon D engages a new partner in the brain and endocrine cells. This may also have cell type-specific implications for MyoVa motor activity (Cao et al, 2019). Despite its ability to bind RILPL2, endogenous Rab8 which is also phosphorylated by R1441G LRRK2 and located at the centriole (Purlyte et al., 2018; Ordonez et al, 2019) does not appear to be sufficient to drive RILPL2 relocalization in cells depleted of Rab10. This may be because MyoVa binds with preference to Rab10, and the MyoVa globular tail domain binds with strong preference to pRab10 and apparently not to pRab8 (Waschb\u00fcsch et al, 2020). Knockout of RILPL2 does not alter the ability of cells to form primary cilia. This is unlike what we reported previously for RILPL1: loss of RILPL1 enhances cilia formation, as if it's normal role is to repress this process (Dhekne et al, 2018). Nevertheless, like RILPL1, expression of HA-RILPL2 blocks ciliogenesis, perhaps by sequestering important components (such as MyoVa or Rab10) in a manner that interferes with their ability to function. Interestingly, video microscopy of protein recruitment to the mother centriole upon serum starvation shows that fluorescently tagged MyoVa arrives within 30 min (Wu et al 2018) whereas GFP-RILPL2 required more than two hours. This points to a possible lead role of centriolar Rab10 in recruiting MyoVa protein. As for RILPL2, its recruitment to the",
