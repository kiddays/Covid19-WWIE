Of all 18 patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, 15 patients comprising 4 transmission clusters were identified. Three patients were infected by direct contact without travel history to Wuhan. Seven patients were asymptomatic on admission. Of 18 patients, 10 patients showed bilateral pneumonia and 2 patients showed no abnormalities. Three patients with comorbidities such as hypertension, liver diseases or diabetes developed severe illness. High C-reactive protein levels and elevations of both ALT and AST were observed in 3 severely ill patients on admission. All 18 patients were eventually discharged, including the 3 severe patients who recovered after treatment with non-invasive mechanical ventilation, convalescent plasma and other therapies. Our findings confirmed human-to-human transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in clusters. The strategies of early diagnosis, early isolation, and early treatment are important to prevent the spread of COVID-19 and improve the cure rate. Patients with comorbidities are more likely to develop severe illness and could benefit from convalescent plasma transfusion.",

During the outbreak, Qinghai rapidly instituted a number of strict control measures to lower transmission, including the enforcement of quarantine measures, early detection, reducing passenger flow, and strong social messaging. By April 6, 2020, no new confirmed cases had been found in Qinghai Province for 60 consecutive days since Feb 6, 2020. More importantly, all 18 patients including 3 severely ill cases had been discharged after treatment by Feb 21, 2020 ( Figure 1 ).",

We detected SARS-CoV-2 antibodies (IgG and IgM) from the convalescent plasma of one donated patient using chemiluminescent immunoassay. The level of IgG was very high (>30 AU/mL) and IgG (1:80) was 3.464 AU/mL. As expected, the level of IgM was very low (0.093 AU/mL). The CT images, blood gas analysis and symptoms improved after convalescent plasma transfusion. No adverse events were observed. One possible explanation for the efficacy of convalescent plasma is that the antibodies from convalescent plasma might suppress viraemia. 23 Our study has several limitations. First, with the limited number of cases in Qinghai province, the results should be interpreted with caution. Second, we did not investigate the correlation between the viral load and the dynamics of cellular immune responses, which may be related to the severity of COVID-19. Third, at the time of convalescent plasma transfusion, the antibody level test (IgG, IgM et al) had not yet been routinely introduced at the hospital and no treatment guideline for using convalescent plasma was released. We did not measure the antibody concentrations in severe patients before and after convalescent plasma transfusion, so it is difficult to accurately evaluate the efficacy related to convalescent plasma.

The median duration of lopinavir/ritonavir and interferon-\u03b12b treatment was 8 days (IQR, 5.5-10). 11 (61%) patients were given antibacterial treatment (moxifloxacin) and all patients were treated with various traditional Chinese medicines according to different symptoms and signs of each person. One patient with moderate COVID-19 showed cardiotoxicity with high level of creatine kinase (2756 U/L) after treatment with moxifloxacin and lopinavir/ ritonavir. 10 (56%) patients received oxygen therapy by nasal cannula. The corrected PaO2/FiO2 values of 3 severe patients were 217, 174 and 163 mm Hg, respectively, which were below 300 mm Hg.
