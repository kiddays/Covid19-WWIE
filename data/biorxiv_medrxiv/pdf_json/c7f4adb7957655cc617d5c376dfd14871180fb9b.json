(ii) Clinically diagnosed cases will be underestimating the total 204number of infected cases due to the testing limits or saturation. Hence, a realistic estimate of 205 the total number of infected cases will be following a middle ground between the two.

On the other hand, our model might still 316 overestimate the total number of cases (but not as much as the SEIR approach) as it is based 317 on the initial conditions and infection dynamics as per R0 values. Indeed, there are a host of 318 other confounding factors that can govern R0 such as the climatic conditions, host genetics, 319 immune status, age, gender and co-morbidities. Therefore, the best estimate of total infected320 population lies between model predictions and actual observation (Figure (d)-(f)). While 321 their difference could be small in the early stages, the disparity could be staggering at later 322 stages. To account for this unreliability, we have added a model correction factor L, inspired 323 by the Kalman filter that provides an estimate of the infected population 33 . Here, the estimate 324 of the infected population at any time is computed as the sum of the infected population in 325 the previous timestep \u2212 1 and the difference between observed and model prediction at 326 weighted with L (see Methods). |L| resides between 0 and 1 based on the confidence of the 327 model and observation: L value of 0 implies 100% confidence in the model, while a value of 328 1 implies 100% confidence in the observation. We suggest that former (L = 0) can be used in 329 countries with a scarce level of COVID-19 testing while the latter (L = 1) can be used where 330 there is ample testing capacity (Figures 2(d)-(f)). In this scenario, the real observations 331 provide a lower bound of the infected cases while our AICSEIR model provides the upper 332 bound. This, in turn, allows the estimation of infections that may be undetected or 333 asymptomatic, as both play major roles in the transmission of the infections. 334 335 (iii) Representative state-wise prediction of COVID-State-wise evolution of COVID-19.

            "text": "The dynamics of disease spread, therefore, involves a few primary cases and an 70index case up to which point the R0 is limited in its value. Beyond this, when the infection 71 starts to move from index cases to their contacts, the R0 assumes greater magnitude and then 72it can drive community transmission that is currently being witnessed in many countries and 73 feared in others that are behind in their epidemic evolution.74 75Although R0 is a measure of communicability of COVID-19, its upper range determines the 76 speed of spread. Estimation of R0 assumes that everyone around a primary case is equally 77susceptible to the infection and thereby suggests that it is dependent on the causative agent 78alone. However, R0 is a function of direct and indirect interactions between the agent, host 79 and environment. The hosts' immune status, genetic makeup, comorbidities, gender and 80 smoking can contribute towards disease transmission. Equally, the environment that supports 81transmission is dynamic via variations in temperature, humidity, population density, 82 migration, adaptive interventions like quarantine/isolation/social distancing, socio-economic 83conditions and so on 18-22 . Hence, the use of a constant value for R0 cannot capture the 84 evolving transmission dynamics accurately. To address this challenge, we first estimated the 85",
