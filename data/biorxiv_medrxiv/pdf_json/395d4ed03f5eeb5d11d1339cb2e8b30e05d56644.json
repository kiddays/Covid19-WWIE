SARS-CoV-2 RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) provides a promising but challenging drug target due to its intrinsic proofreading exoribonuclease (ExoN) function. Nucleoside triphosphate (NTP) analogues added to the growing RNA chain should supposedly terminate viral RNA replication, but ExoN can cleave the incorporated compounds and counteract their efficacy. Remdesivir targeting SARS-CoV-2 RdRp exerts high drug efficacy in vitro and in vivo. However, its underlying inhibitory mechanisms remain elusive.",

            "text": "Here, we performed all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations with an accumulated simulation time of 12.6 microseconds to elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying the inhibitory effects of remdesivir in nucleotide addition (RdRp complex: nsp12-nsp7-nsp8) and proofreading (ExoN complex: nsp14-nsp10). We found that the 1'-cyano group of remdesivir possesses the dual role of inhibiting both nucleotide addition and proofreading. For nucleotide addition, we showed that incorporation of one remdesivir is not sufficient to terminate RNA synthesis. Instead, the presence of the polar 1'-cyano group of remdesivir at an upstream site causes instability via its electrostatic interactions with a salt bridge formed by Asp865 and Lys593, rendering translocation unfavourable. This may eventually lead to a delayed chain termination of RNA extension by three nucleotides. For proofreading, remdesivir can inhibit cleavage via the steric clash between the 1'-cyano group and Asn104. To further examine the role of 1'-cyano group in remdesivir's inhibitory effects, we studied three additional NTP analogues with other types of modifications: favipiravir, vidarabine, and fludarabine. Our simulations suggest that all three of them are prone to ExoN cleavage. Our computational findings were further supported by an in vitro assay in Vero E6 cells using live SARS-CoV-2. The dose-response curves suggest that among tested NTP analogues, only remdesivir exerts significant inhibitory effects on viral replication. Our work provides plausible mechanisms at molecular level on how remdesivir inhibits viral RNA replication, and our findings may guide rational design for new treatments of COVID-19 targeting viral replication.",

            "text": "The 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19 coronavirus (CoV) or severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)) has spread rapidly to cause serious outbreaks and eventually a pandemic around the world. As of April 2020, COVID-19 has been reported in 210 countries and almost 3 million cases have been confirmed, resulting in more than 200,000 deaths with an estimated mortality risk of 6.91% 1 . The new CoV has been declared a global emergency by the World Health Organization, as the outbreak continues to spread globally and no clinically approved interventional therapy is currently available to curb this health crisis. Antiviral agents are urgently needed to treat COVID-19 patients. It could take up years to develop new interventions, including therapeutic antibodies, cytokines, nucleic acid-based therapies, and vaccines. Hence, repurposing clinically approved or investigative drugs for other diseases provides a promising approach to develop COVID-19 treatments. CoV has a capsid that envelops the single-stranded RNA genome 2 . Three structural surface proteins are shown to be associated with the capsid: Viral membrane, envelope, and the spike protein 3 . Because SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV share 89% nucleotide identity 4 , chemical compounds and monoclonal antibodies that target SARS-CoV surface proteins or interrupt its binding to host viral receptor have been under investigation for treating SARS-CoV-2 5-7 . In addition, new vaccines targeting the viral surface antigens are under intense development for the prevention of COVID-19. Unfortunately, drugs and vaccines with inhibitory mechanisms targeting surface receptors may not be effective due to the constant evolution of surface receptors to acquire drug resistance and evade host immune response 8 . In contrast, viral RNA-dependent-RNA polymerase (RdRp) is a protein that is deeply buried inside the viral capsule and is functionally conserved for viral replication, rendering it resistant to the propagation of drug-resistant virus. Thus, RdRp serves as a promising drug target for virus infections 9 . Indeed, inhibitors targeting polymerase of SARS-CoV-2 is currently at late stages of clinical trials.",

Non-structural protein (nsp) 12, along with cofactors nsp8 with nsp7, is involved in nascent RNA priming and nucleotide addition [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] . NTP analogues that inhibit nucleotide addition in nsp12 supposedly should inhibit RNA replication. However, in SARS-CoV-2, ExoN of nsp14 has been shown to play a pivotal role in proofreading 17 . To counteract the efficacy of the NTP analogues, nsp14 excises the incorporated NTP analogues [18] [19] . For example, the NTP analogue ribavirin is being incorporated in the nascent RNA to inhibit nucleotide addition of SARS-CoV RdRp. However, ribavirin is readily excised from nascent RNA by nsp14, which may explain its limited efficacy in vivo 16 .",

Subsequently, clinical trials on using remdesivir to treat COVID-19 have been conducted 1 . Remdesivir has shown to be a potent inhibitor of CoV replication including the MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV, and circulating human CoVs 19, 23 . Even though remdesivir is an NTP analogue incorporated by RdRp, it exerts superior antiviral activity over other NTP analogues because the rate of incorporation of remdesivir to nascent RNA by nsp12 is higher than that of its cleavage by nsp14 ExoN 19 . Recently, enormous amount of efforts has been placed in understanding the molecular basis of remdesivir's inhibitory mechanisms on RNA synthesis [14] [15] [24] [25] [26] [27] . Due to the high sequence similarity between SARS and SARS-2, the nsp12-nsp7-nsp8 and nsp14-nsp10 of SARS-CoV serve as reliable models to study the mechanisms of RNA replication of SARS-CoV-2. Furthermore, the cryo-EM structures of SARS-CoV-2 nsp12-nsp7-nsp8 have been recently solved [14] [15] , with the catalytic (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder.

However, only one of these SARS-CoV polymerase structures contains the nascent and template strands, which is in the pre-translocation state with pyrophosphate ion (PPi) still bound at the active site 15 . Hence, molecular mechanisms, particularly the dynamics of the nucleotide addition cycle of either NTP or NTP analogues remain largely unknown. Biochemical assays have shown in MERS CoV 24 and recently in SARS-CoV-2 15, 25 that remedivir causes \"delayed chain termination\" in RNA synthesis, wherein several rounds of nucleotide additions can still proceed after remdesivir incorporation prior to completed termination. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying this delayed termination induced by remdesivir remain largely elusive. Furthermore, it is also not clear how remdesivir can evade the proofreading activity of SARS-CoV-2 to prevent itself from being cleaved by ExoN.",

For RdRp, our MD simulations show that remdesivir at the 3'-terminal can reduce the efficiency of nucleotide addition in nsp12. More interestingly, we found that remdesivir at an upstream site (i+3 site) can block translocation via interactions formed by its 1'-cyano group and thus results in delayed chain termination. For ExoN, we found that the relatively bulky 1'-cyano group on the ribose of remdesivir introduces steric interactions and effectively disrupts the stability of the catalytic active conformation, and thus effectively inhibit the exonuclease activity of ExoN. Furthermore, our MD simulations of three additional NTP analogues containing other base and ribose modifications (favipiravir, vidarabine and fludarabine) suggest that they are all prone to be cleaved by ExoN, underlining the important role of the 1'-cyano substitution in remdesivir. Our simulation results are supported by an in vitro assay to examine the efficiency of NTP analogues in inhibiting SARS-CoV-2 live virus growth. We found that only remdesivir shows inhibitory effect, consistent with our MD simulations.",

            "text": "Remdesivir can reduce the efficiency of nucleotide addition in RdRp Our structural model of SARS-CoV-2 RdRp (nsp12-nsp7-nsp8) has been constructed based on the cryo-EM structure of SARS-CoV RdRp (PDBID: 6NUR 12 , see Fig. 1A ). Template and nascent RNA strands have been constructed by the structural alignment of modelled SARS-CoV-2 RdRp to the norovirus RdRp (PDBID: 3H5Y 28 , see Methods and SI Section 1.1 for details). Twenty replicas of 30-ns MD simulations were performed for the RdRp in the posttranslocation state, in which the active site (i site) is occupied by adenosine triphosphate (ATP) ( Fig. 1A and 1C, see SI Section 2.2.1 for details). To validate this model (named as \"wildtype-RNA\"), we first examined the stability of the active site by assessing the distance between the a phosphate (Pa) of ATP and O3' atom of the 3'-terminal nucleotide ( Fig. 2A) . Typically, such distance is required to be below 4 \u00c5 to allow efficient catalysis to form the phosphodiester bond (e.g. 3.4 \u00c5 in the structure of norovirus RdRp 28 and 3.5~4.0 \u00c5 suggested by previous computational studies [29] [30] ). Consistent with this distance requirement, we found that the distribution of the O3'-Pa distance peaks at ~3.5 \u00c5 (see the gray curve in Fig. 2A) . Furthermore, the base-to-base distance between ATP and its base-paired template nucleotide was also measured as an estimation of base-pairing stability 31 . We found that such base-to-base distance is most populated at ~7.5 \u00c5, similar to the distance of 7.4~7.6 \u00c5 as observed in structures of other viral polymerases 28, 32 (Fig. 2D ). In addition, we investigated base stacking stability as another criteria for the propensity of nucleotide addition 31 . We found that the distance between the base of NTP and the base of 3'-terminal nucleotide is most populated at ~4.5 \u00c5 (Fig. 2G) , consistent with the distance of 4.2 \u00c5 as observed in norovirus 28 and poliovirus 32 RdRps.",

For the two apo structures, the root-mean-square-deviation (RMSD) of Ca atoms was used as comparison to our model. We found that the averaged RMSDs are 2.36 \u00c5 (PDBID: 6M71) 14 and 2.30 \u00c5 (PDBID: 7BV1 15 ), indicating that the overall architecture of our nsp12 model is similar to that of the apo cryo-EM structures of SARS-CoV-2. For the holo structure, the RMSDs of Ca atoms and nucleotides between our structural model and the holo cryo-EM structure (PDBID: 7BV2 15 ) were 2.12 \u00c5 and 2.23 \u00c5, respectively. This further validated our wildtype-RNA model.

Interestingly, we found that the distribution of the critical O3'-Pa distance in the remdesivir-TP system is still largely below 4 \u00c5, even though it is substantially broader compared to ATP ( Fig. 2A) . These results suggest that the incorporation of remdesivir-TP is still allowed but with a reduced efficiency compared to ATP. Furthermore, no obvious negative effect on base pairing and base stacking stability is induced by remdesivir-TP at i site ( Fig. 2D and 2G ). Altogether, our observations suggest that remdesivir-TP can largely maintain a catalytically active conformation, and thus can be added to the 3'-end of the nascent RNA chain even at a reduced efficiency.

The histogram of critical distances of NTP incorporation shows no obvious discrepancy from that of wildtype-RNA (Figs. 1C, 1F, 1I and S2). This suggests that remdesivir at i+2, i+3 or i+4 site has negligible impact on the nucleotide addition at the active site.

To obtain statistically meaningful results, we performed twenty 30-ns MD simulations for each of these systems (see SI Section 2.2.2 for details). To investigate the propensity of translocation, we first inspect how remdesivir may impact stability of the RdRp complex by examining probability of hydrogen bonds formed between remdesivir and its template uracil. As shown in Fig. 4A and Fig. S3 , the hydrogen bonds of remdesivir:U are nearly intact when remdesivir is at i, i+1, and i+2 sites in both pre-(pre-T) and posttranslocation (post-T) states, suggesting that translocation of remdesivir is allowed in these systems. It is worth mentioning that interactions between remdesivir (at i site) and surrounding residues in our model are consistent with those in the recently solved SARS-CoV-2 RdRp holo structure 15 (Fig. S4 ). Our observations are also consistent with a recent structural modelling study, which suggests that remdesivir at the active site (i site) cannot hinder translocation 26 .",

            "text": "In sharp contrast, we found that remdesivir at i+3 site greatly weakens the hydrogen bond probability of base pairing with its template uracil (Fig. 4A ). Further investigations show that the presence of the highly polar 1'-cyano group on remdesivir will exert strong electrostatic attractions (~16.1 KJ/mol) with the salt bridge formed by Lys593 and Asp865 of RdRp (Fig.  4B ). These electrostatic attractions will further pull remdesivir away from its canonical conformation and cause the destabilization of its base pairing (Fig. 4B) . Indeed, the hydrogen bonds for the base pairing of remdesivir:U are subsequently disrupted, rendering the corresponding RdRp complex unstable (Fig. 4A ). Recently solved Cryo-EM structure 15 also shows that Lys593 (d=4.6 \u00c5) and Asp865 (d=4.3 \u00c5) are in spatial proximity with 1'-cyano group when remdesivir was modelled at i+3 site. For translocation of RNA polymerases, a post-T state with the empty active site often has comparable stability with its corresponding pre-T state, and subsequent binding of NTP can greatly stabilize post-T state and favor forward translocation 35 . We thus anticipate that translocation of remdesivir into i+3 site (post-T) will still be allowed due to the stabilization of NTP binding, but after NTP incorporation, the unstable complex with remdesivir at i+3 site may hinder the RNA extension. Next, we investigate if this instability induced by remdesivir at i+3 site can affect the dynamics of subsequent translocation to i+4 site by generating a translocation pathway using the Climber algorithm [35] [36] (see Methods and SI Section 3 for details). Interestingly, we found that the 1'cyano group need to first move closer to the negatively charged Asp865 before it translocates away to i+4 site, while its distance with Lys593 is noticeably larger than that with Asp865 during translocation (Fig. 4C ). As the electron-withdrawing 1'-cyano moiety exhibits d --anion repulsion with Asp865, the intermediate conformation with reduced distance to Asp865 will experience unfavorable repulsions (~10.5 kJ/mol raised energy, see Fig. 4D ), and we expect that this may hinder forward translocation (Fig. 4C) . Altogether, the above observations suggest a delayed termination of three nucleotides as observed in SARS-CoV-2 25 and MERS-CoV 24 .",

Based on homology modelling, Shannon et al. 26 proposed another mechanism where translocation is inhibited due to the steric clash between Arg858 and remdesivir's ribose at i+4 site. However, our MD simulations with remdesivir at i+4 site show a large distance (~11.4 \u00c5) between Arg858 and 1'-cyano group of remdesivir (Fig. S5A) . Consistent with our simulations, a large separation of 9.5 \u00c5 between Arg858 and the 1'-cyano group of remdesivir was also observed when we modelled remdesivir at i+4 site using the recent cryo-EM structure (PDBID: 7BV2 15 , see Fig. S5B ). To obtain the translocation pathway, we adopted the Climber method [35] [36] , in which the RdRp complex is progressively driven from pre-T to post-T state by external energy. To rigorously study dynamics of large-scale conformational changes during translocation, we need to apply more advanced methods such as Markov State Model 35, 37-42 , which is beyond the scope of our current study. Finally, comparison of the sequences between SARS-CoV-2 and other coronaviruses indicates that the Asp865 --Lys593 + salt bridge is conserved except that Lys was replaced by another positively charged Arg in two human CoVs (Fig. S6) , implying that our proposed mechanism may be employed by other CoV RdRp.",

As previous work suggests that three nucleotide base pairs are melted in the active site of ExoN 44 , we modelled a singlestranded RNA containing three nucleotides based on structural alignment to DNA polymerase I Klenow Fragment 44 and DNA Polymerase III e subunit 45 (see Method and SI Section 1.2 for details). Twenty 30-ns MD simulations were performed for the wildtype-RNA, in which the 3'-terminal is occupied by adenine (see SI Section 2.3.1 for details). To assess the stability of cleavage site, we examined the distance between MgA and the O3' atom of the second last nucleotide at the 3'-terminal as it is essential for cleavage [46] [47] [48] (Fig 5A) . This distance is well maintained in most of the simulations (Fig. S7 ), and the histogram shows only one peak in the region of 2.0~2.5 \u00c5 (Fig. 5A ) suitable for cleavage [46] [47] [48] . MgA-MgB distance is also critical for cleavage [46] [47] [48] [49] and our calculations show a sharp peak at ~ 3.6 \u00c5 (Fig. 5B) , a distance permissible for cleavage [46] [47] [48] [49] . By sharp contrast, MD simulations with remdesivir at 3'-terminal show destabilization of cleavage site in ExoN, with the coordination between MgA and O3' atoms more frequently disrupted (Fig. S8 ). Consistently, a second peak appears at ~3.7\u00c5 in the distribution of O3'-MgA distance, indicating that remdesivir causes an increase in the population of cleavage-inhibited configurations (Fig. 5A ). This increase was also observed in the histogram of MgA-MgB distance with a second peak clearly appearing at ~4.9 \u00c5 (Fig. 5B ). Further examination of the base stepping twisting angle (Fig. S9) shows that the base of remdesivir twists more significantly than that of adenine (Fig. 5C) , which also suggests that remdesivir is experiencing unfavorable interactions at the 3'-terminal. All these observations indicate that remdesivir is not stable in the cleavage site and hence not prone to be cleaved.",

The wildtype nucleotide does not have a bulky group attached at the ribose ring. Hence, no specific steric effect is observed in the cleavage site as shown by a representative conformation of wildtype-RNA (Fig.  5E) . Conversely, the 1'-cyano group of remdesivir causes steric clash with the side chain of protein residue Asn104. This steric repulsion separates Asn104 and remdesivir apart from each other, as consolidated by the larger distance between the base of Asn104 and nitrogen atom in the amide group of Asn104 (Fig. 5D ). This steric interaction is clearly demonstrated in representative conformations as shown in Fig. 5F . On one hand, if remdesivir adopts a similar conformation as wildtype-RNA at 3'-terminal, the cyano group will push down the side chain of Asn104. On the other hand, if the side chain of Asn104 maintains its configuration as in the wildtype-RNA, the steric interaction will push the ribose along with the base of remdesivir rotating away (Fig. 5F ). Therefore, we attribute the destabilization of remdesivir at cleavage site to the steric repulsion between 1'-cyano group of remdesivir and Asn104. This observation from MD simulations is consistent with a recent study based on static structural model of nsp14 of SARS-CoV-2, which also proposes that the 1'-cyano group has steric clash with the cleavage site 26 . This destabilization would reduce the possibility of remdesivir to be excised by ExoN, enabling remdesivir to be an effective inhibitor for SARS-CoV-2.",

However, they are structurally different from adenine in either the base (favipiravir) or the ribose (vidarabine). Like remdesivir, fludarabine has modifications in both the base and ribose.

Favipiravir-TP and vidarabine-TP were shown to possess similar mean Pa-O3' distance (~4.0 \u00c5) compared with remdesivir (Fig. 6B ). This distance is significantly raised to ~5.0 \u00c5 for fludarabine-TP, implicating the difficulty of fludarabine to be incorporated into the nascent RNA strand. Further inspection of the MD conformations revealed that the instability of fludarabine-TP in the active site could be attributed to the fluoro-substitution on the base. Fluorine atom is electronegative, and causes a d --drepulsion with the oxygen atom in the base of the template uracil (Fig. S10) , thus destabilizing its configuration at the active site. The baseto-base distance between the NTP analogue and the template nucleotide in the active site only marginally increased by < 0.25 \u00c5 for all the NTP analogues compared to wildtype-RNA (Fig.  S11A) . Similarly, the mean base stacking distances for the NTP analogues are equal to or even shorter than that for ATP (Fig. S11C) .

Vidarabine and fludarabine were shown to have even shorter distance (~3.3 \u00c5) than wildtype-RNA, due to an extra hydrogen bond formed between their 2'-hydroxyl group of the NTP analogue and 4'-oxygen of NTP (hydrogen bond probability of 89% and 94% for vidarabine and fludarabine, respectively). Base-to-base distance between NTP and the template nucleotides are not perturbed by the presence of the NTP analogue at i+1 site (Fig. S11B) . Favipiravir also shows similar base stacking distance as wildtype-RNA, while this distance is slightly increased by around 0.3~0.4 \u00c5 for vidarabine and fludarabine (Fig. S11D ). In addition, as none of these three NTP analogues contains a bulky substitution group on the ribose like 1'-cyano on remdesivir (Fig. 6A) , we anticipate that it will be unlikely for them to inhibit RNA synthesis via a delayed termination mechanism. Altogether, we expect that favipiravir can reduce NTP incorporation to a similar extent as remdesivir, while vidarabine and fludarabine at i+1 do not reduce NTP incorporation due to the shortening of the O3'-Pa distance.

Among the four NTP analogues tested, only remdesivir was found to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 replication in Vero E6 cells with EC50 under 100 \u00b5M (Fig. 6F ). This is consistent with our previous work 50 , which determined the EC50 of vidarabine to be 23.15 \u00b5M and 26.90 \u00b5M using virus titer and real-time PCR, respectively. Other NTP analogues (vidarabine, fludarabine and favipiravir) did not inhibit viral replication under 100 \u00b5M (Fig. 6F) .

            "text": "In this study, we have elucidated the important role of 1'-cyano group on the ribose in remdesivir's inhibition effect targeted RNA replication (Fig. 7) . Extensive MD simulations were performed based on the structural model of RdRp and ExoN of SARS-CoV-2. Remdesivir at i+1 site can reduce nucleotide addition at the active site but cannot fully inhibit nucleotide addition. Instead, remdesivir mainly inhibits nucleotide addition via a delayed chain terminating mechanism, where the growing RNA chain will be terminated once a few nucleotides are added after remdesivir incorporation. We propose a model where the polar 1'cyano group of remdesivir at the upstream i+3 site will cause instability of the RdRp complex, because the salt bridge (Asp865 --Lys593 + ) will pull remdesivir away from its canonical conformation to break its base pairing. Furthermore, the dynamic transition of translocation from i+3 site to i+4 site will be further hindered due to unfavorable anion-drepulsion between Asp865 and the 1'-cyano group of remdesivir. As a result, remdesivir leads to a delayed termination of three nucleotides. In addition, remdesivir was found to be capable of inhibiting the proofreading function of ExoN. The 1'-cyano group of remdesivir exhibits steric clash with a nearby residue Asn104, which destabilizes remdesivir at the active site, rendering it resistant to ExoN cleavage. Further investigation using three other NTP analogues showed different inhibiting effects on nucleotide addition in RdRp, albeit all of them are more prone to be cleaved than remdesivir. Comparison among the structural modifications of remdesivir with other three NTP analogues suggests that the modification on the ribose, possibility by using a bulky group substitution may be a better strategy than on the base to inhibit the RNA synthesis of SARS-CoV-2. Our work provides mechanistic insights at atomistic details on how remdesivir can effectively inhibit SARS-CoV-2 RNA synthesis. We also revealed that the chemical modification at the ribose of remdesivir that carries the dual inhibitory function to terminate both nucleotide addition and proofreading could be a promising general strategy for designing prospective nucleoside-analog inhibitors to treat COVID-19.",

Partial charges of NTP analogues were generated following the Restricted Electrostatic Potential scheme [58] [59] (see SI for details). For ATP or NTP analogues in the triphosphate form, parameters for the triphosphate tail were taken from those developed by Meagher et al. 60 . The system was gradually relaxed before the production simulation under NVT ensemble (T=300 K). V-rescale thermostat 61 was applied with the coupling time constant of 0.1 ps. The long-range electrostatic interactions beyond the cut-off at 12 \u00c5 were treated with the Particle-Mesh Ewald method. 62 Lennard-Jones interactions were smoothly switched off from 10 \u00c5 to 12 \u00c5. The neighbor list was updated every 10 steps. An integration time step of 2.0 fs was used and the LINCS algorithm 63 was applied to constrain all the bonds. We saved the snapshots every 20 ps. All simulations were performed with Gromacs 5.0 64 . The equilibrated system containing wildtype RNA serves as the structural basis for modelling NTP analogue at the corresponding site to investigate their inhibitory effects.
