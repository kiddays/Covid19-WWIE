However, these parameters have not been observed consistently across studies. The aim of this review was to assess clinical laboratory parameters which may serve as markers or predictors of severe or critical COVID-19 disease Methods: We conducted a systematic search of MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science, CINAHL and Google Scholar databases from 2019 through April 18, 2020, and reviewed bibliographies of eligible studies, relevant systematic reviews, and the medRxiv pre-print server. We included hospital-based observational studies reporting clinical laboratory parameters of confirmed cases of COVID-19 and excluded studies having large proportions (>10%) of children and pregnant women. Two authors independently carried out screening of articles, data extraction and quality assessment. Meta-analyses were done using random effects model. Meta-median difference (MMD) and 95% confidence interval (CI) was calculated for each laboratory parameter. Results: Forty-five studies in 6 countries were included. Compared to non-severe COVID-19 cases, severe or critical COVID-19 disease was characterised by higher neutrophil count (MMD: 1.23 [95% CI: 0.58 to 1.88] \u00d710 9 cells/L), and lower lymphocyte and CD4 counts with MMD (95% CI) of -0.39 (-0.47, -0.31) \u00d710 9 cells/L and -204.9 (-302.6, -107.1) cells/\u03bcl, respectively. Other notable results were observed for C-reactive protein (MMD: 36.97 [95% CI: 27.58, 46.35] mg/L), interleukin-6 (MMD: 17.37 [95% CI: 4.74, 30.00] pg/ml,), Troponin I (MMD: 0.01 [0.00, 0.02] ng/ml), and D-dimer (MMD: 0.65 [0.45, 0.85] mg/ml).",

Approximately 18% of diagnosed COVID-19 cases have severe or critical disease, and about 5% of diagnosed COVID-19 require intensive care management with or without mechanical ventilation [8, 13] . Consequently, there is substantial pressure on healthcare systems worldwide, particularly on intensive care units. As healthcare systems become further stretched by the increasing numbers of cases, identifying clinical laboratory parameters associated with severe and critical cases is crucial in helping clinicians triage patients appropriately and optimize use of the limited healthcare resources. Furthermore, as more clinical trials are being launched to test possible treatments for COVID-19, laboratory parameters associated with COVID-19 severity can aid in monitoring the clinical evolution of cases on trial drugs and serve as composite or secondary outcomes for these trials.",

The aim of this meta-analysis was to investigate which clinical laboratory parameters may be associated with severe or critical COVID-19 disease. Out of the 39 clinical laboratory parameters evaluated, we found that derangements in 36 clinical laboratory parameters were significantly associated with severe or critical COVID-19. Whilst some of the observed associations may not be clinically relevant, certain, more pronounced laboratory abnormalities may have important clinical implications. Markers of an overactive innate immune system such as markedly elevated neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), IL-6, serum ferritin and C-reactive protein, and markers of a deficient adaptive immune system such as lymphocytes and CD4 count could help recognise potential severe infections during triage, while markers of organ failure could be helpful in monitoring evolution of hospitalised COVID-19 patients.",

The adaptive immune system is activated a few days later and is responsible for a more specific response, which is immunomodulatory (via engagement of helper T cells and regulatory T cells) and produces 'immunological memory' [33] . Elevated lymphocyte count is commonly found in most viral infections, and the magnitude and quality of T cell responses may determine the fate of these infections [34, 35] . Failure to mount an appropriate adaptive immune response means the innate immune response remains continuously stimulated with deleterious effects on the lungs and other organs. We found that severe or critical COVID-19 patients had increased markers of innate immune system activity compared to patients with non-severe disease. This is evidenced in the significantly higher levels of neutrophils, IL-6, and acute phase reaction markers such as CRP, ESR and serum ferritin, as well as decreased concentrations of albumin and prealbumin.",

            "text": "release syndrome observed in some patients with severe or critical COVID-19 is mediated by interferons, TNFs, and cytokines secreted by non-T cell leucocytes such as macrophages, neutrophils and NK cells which are all key elements of innate immunity to viruses[39].These findings could be applied clinically to identify severe or critical COVID-19 patients. For example, routine monitoring of NLR may provide insight into the functioning of both the innate and adaptive immune responses and help predict the clinical course of COVID-19. Despite the 45 studies included in this review, only five reported results for NLR; all these five studies found a significant association between increased NLR and severe or critical COVID-19 disease.We also found that patients with severe or critical COVID-19 had significantly higher biomarkers of tissue and organ damage such as LDH, liver enzymes, kidney function parameters and markers of myocardial function. These observed associations could be explained by 3 mechanisms. First, the virus may cause direct organ damage by attaching to the ACE2 receptors, which are commonly expressed in the lungs, heart, arteries, kidneys and intestines[40]. The second, more indirect mechanism is systemic hyperinflammation caused by the cytokine release syndrome mediated by the innate immune system[40]. Systemic hyperinflammation affects all organs and could also explain the significantly increased expression of markers of disseminated intravascular coagulation (high D-dimer and depleted platelet count) in severely or critically ill patients[41, 42]. The third, also indirect, mechanism by which severe or critical COVID-19 causes multiple organ damage is hypoxia resulting from respiratory failure.Once the mechanisms of COVID-19 induced organ damage are better understood, markers reflecting the pathophysiological changes caused by these mechanisms may find their way into clinical practice. Based on the results of our meta-analysis especially promising may be markers of immune function such as NLR, IL-6, C-reactive protein, serum ferritin, lymphocytes, CD4 count, and markers of coagulation and organ damage such as D-dimer, LDH, troponin I and liver enzymes.The strengths and limitations of this review and meta-analysis need to be considered in the context of rapidly evolving literature. On the one hand, our study identified some associations that deserve further consideration and may lead to improvements in the risk stratification, monitoring and management of COVID-19 patients. On the other hand, it is important to our analyses need to be viewed as hypothesis-generating rather than hypothesistesting. Due to the large number of associations examined simultaneously there is a considerable likelihood of false-positive findings. This limitation can be addressed in future, more focused, studies that will take into consideration prior knowledge and reduce the likelihood of falsepositive results through application of Bayesian and empirical-Bayes methods[43]. Our review is also affected by the limitations of the underlying literature. Of those, perhaps the most important is the cross-sectional nature of the analyses used in most publications. Although it is plausible that markers of immune function can be used to predict disease severity, the evidence would have been stronger if the studies were able to perform laboratory testing of COVID-19",

Based on the results of our meta-analysis, especially promising markers are NLR, IL-6, serum ferritin, lymphocyte and CD4 counts, Ddimer and troponin I.
