The RNA secondary structure is a functional characteristic of RNA viruses, and together with the accumulated high-throughput sequencing data could provide general insights towards understanding virus biology. Here, we profiled the RNA secondary structure of >7500 complete viral genomes from 11 different families of viral hemorrhagic fevers, including dengue serotypes, ebola, and yellow fever. Our results suggest not only an interesting lack of secondary structure for very aggressive and virulent viruses such as DENV-2 and ebola but also a different correlation between secondary structure and the number of interaction sites with human proteins, for example, with an anti-correlation of -0.84 for chikungunya. We demonstrate that the secondary structure and presence of proteinbinding domains in the genomes to build similarity trees can be used to classify the viruses. We also used structural data to study the geographical distribution of dengue, finding a significant difference between DENV-3 from Asia and South-America, which could imply different evolutionary routes of this subtype.",

The existence of four different serotypes (DENV-1, 2, 3, 4), with also a fifth recently reported 3 , complicates the development of an effective vaccine 4 . The four serotypes show not only significant differences in sequence similarity 5 but also distinctive infection dynamics. For example, DENV-1 is the most wide-spread serotype, followed by DENV-2 6, 7 , which is also more often associated with severe cases 8 .

For example, Yellow Fever is also a mosquito-borne VHFs, with higher mortality but a slower rate of evolutionary change compared to Dengue 9 . The mild VHF Chikungunya shares the same vector with Dengue, mosquito Aedes aegypti, and the two viruses can even coexist in the same mosquito 10 .

Other structural regions, including the 3' UTR, were found conserved not only in Dengue serotypes but also between Dengue and Zika 16 .

However, while the RNA secondary structure is an informative element to characterise viruses, the secondary structure of only a few viral genomes has been experimentally characterized 16, 19 . Consequently, while thousands of viral genomes have been sequenced, we can only rely on in silico data to study their secondary structure. Furthermore, predicting the RNA secondary structure of entire viral genomes can be challenging, due to usually large sizes of >10000 nucleotides (nt), where most thermodynamic algorithms used to model the secondary structure drop in performance after 700 nt 20 . In our work, we computationally profiled the RNA secondary structure of >7500 viral genomes (prioritising Dengue serotypes and in general VHFs) using Computational Recognition of Secondary Structure (CROSS), a neural network trained on experimental data, which was successfully applied to predict HIV genome structure 21 . We mapped the secondary structure properties of the viruses on the world map, to study the genome interaction with proteins, and to further classify and understand the viruses.",

DENV-3 is the only serotype with both UTRs more structured than the entire genome (5' UTR= 0.55 and 3' UTR=0.53; Figure 2 ), while DENV-1 has a highly structured 5' UTR (structural content = 0.53). This result is in line with the experimental Parallel Analysis of RNA Structure (PARS) data coming from human RNAs, where the UTRs were more structured than the CDS 28 . This suggests that some viruses tend to mimic the secondary structure of human mRNAs to be efficiently translated by the cellular machinery 29 . This is also further supported in Dengue, where a complex structure at the 3' UTR was shown to mimic the absent polyA, to enhance translation 30 . Interestingly, Ebola has the least structured UTRs (structural content 5' UTR = 0.46; 3' UTR = 0.41). In Zika, the 3' UTR is more structured than the 5' (Figure 3c ; 3' UTR=0.56, 5' UTR = 0.50). Chikungunya shows not only the highest structural variability in the 3' UTR (3' UTR = 0.43, Figure 3b ), but also a very structured 5' UTR ( Figure 3a) . Finally, Ebola, DENV-1, and DENV-3 exhibit a more structured 5' UTR, especially when compared with DENV-2, DENV-4 and Japanese Encephalitis, which tend to be more structured (Figure 3c ).",

The mosquito-transmitted Yellow Fever and Chikungunya form a cluster, indicating that their structural content is similar. This is partially in agreement with the VHFs tree 26 .

The general picture is quite complex, with some viruses showing a propensity to interact with proteins if they are more or less structured. Similarly to dengue, the mild hemorrhagic fever Chikungunya shows a high anticorrelation (r=-0.84; p-value < 2.2e-16, Figure 6 ). Conversely, Tick-borne Encephalitis and Zika show a positive correlation (Pearson correlation of 0.23 and 0.89; p-value 0.01 and <2.2e-16 respectively; Figure 6 ). The high positive correlation, especially for Zika, suggests that specific highly-structured viruses are also prone to interact with human proteins. DENV-3 and DENV-4 act similarly to Chikungunya, having unstructured genomes, allowing potentially more interactions with proteins ( Figure 5b) . Finally, Japanese Encephalitis and West Nile Fever show almost no correlation of the structure and on the possible interaction with proteins (r~0). These results indicate a complex relationship between the structural content and protein-binding motifs.",

However, a comprehensive secondary structural landscape for their genomes was lacking. In our work, we computationally profiled and analysed the secondary structure profiles of more than 7500 complete viral genomes, including almost 4000 dengue samples, and 3500 other viral hemorrhagic fever-causing viruses. By studying the structural profiles, we observed that Dengue viruses are predicted to be less structured compared to viruses such as Zika, Yellow Fever, and West Nile Fever (Figure 2) . Conversely, Dengue serotypes still tend to retain structured UTRs, probably to be efficiently translated by the cellular machinery, similarly to human mRNAs 25, 28 .",

The secondary structure and interaction with proteins can be used to cluster the viruses in agreement with previous phylogenetic trees, such as Dengue serotypes, and Japanese Encephalitis with West Nile Fever. Conversely, some relationships are surprising, as for example, DENV-2 is closer to Ebola when the secondary structure is used to establish similarity, but not when using the interaction with proteins.

Each point represents a single genome, while x-and y-axes indicate its structural content and the number of protein binding domains divided by the averaged size of the genome, respectively.Tables Table 1. The information regarding the number of genomes available, the family, and the average size of each family for all the viruses used in our analysis.SupplementaryFigures Supplementary Figure 1. Violin plot showing the interaction with proteins for each dengue serotype, computed as the presence of RNA binding motifs on their genome, averaged for the mean of the length of each serotype. Supplementary Figure 2. Dendrograms classifying the different viruses using as metric the correlation between structural content and the presence of protein binding domains. Supplementary Figure 3. Barplot showing for each dengue serotype the differences in structural content (% double-stranded nucleotides) in different geographical samples coming from Africa (AF), Asia (AS), Oceania (OC), South America (SA) and North America (NA).",
