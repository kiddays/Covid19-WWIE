A subset of 45 samples was tested with and without heat inactivation. 46 Results: Fifteen or more days after symptom onset, antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 47 nucleocapsid protein showed 100% sensitivity and 100% specificity, while antibodies to spike 48 protein were detected with 91% sensitivity and 100% specificity. Neither antibody levels nor the 49 rate of seropositivity were significantly reduced by heat inactivation of samples. Analysis of 50 daily samples from six patients with COVID-19 showed anti-nucleocapsid and spike antibodies 51 appearing between day 8 to day 14 after initial symptoms. Immunocompromised patients 52 generally had a delayed antibody response to SARS-CoV-2 compared to immunocompetent 53 patients. 54 Conclusions: Antibody to the nucleocapsid protein of SARS-CoV-2 is more sensitive than 55 spike protein antibody for detecting early infection. Analyzing heat-inactivated samples by LIPS 56 is a safe and sensitive method for detecting SARS-CoV-2 antibodies.",

To et al. examined antibodies against both the 85 spike and nucleocapsid by ELISA in a small number of samples and found that IgG antibodies 86 against the nucleocapsid protein were generally detectable at about the same time as antibodies 87 to the spike protein [11] . Despite these findings, further studies are needed to better understand 88 antibody dynamics in persons infected with SARS-CoV-2 to determine the most sensitive and 89 specific antibody assays, and to use these antibody-based tests to determine seroprevalence in 90 different populations. In addition, it is currently unknown whether the viral RNA that has been 91 detected in the blood [11, 13] indicates the presence of infectious virus, but this has the potential 92 to be a safety hazard for health care workers, clinical laboratory technicians and researchers 93 analyzing serology in persons infected with SARS-CoV-2. Thus, a sensitive and specific 94 antibody assay using heat treated plasma or serum may enhance safety when working with these 95 fluids. 96 We and others have employed a liquid phase immunoassay technology termed Luciferase 97 Immunoprecipitation Systems (LIPS) to measure antibodies against many different viruses, to 98 stratify infected patients based on the level of their antibodies, and for virus discovery [20] . range up to 6 log10 for some antigens and require < 5 ul of plasma or sera for testing.

While excessive proinflammatory responses 321 to the virus have been reported to contribute to poor outcomes [29-31], larger studies of COVID-322 19 patients are required to determine whether antibody levels directly correlate with disease 323 severity. 324 Prior studies have shown high levels of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in blood from patients with 325 COVID-19 [1, 4]. At present, it is not certain whether infectious virus might be circulating in the 326 blood early during infection. Accordingly, we heated plasma or serum to 56 o C for 30 min to 327 reduce the titer of SARS-CoV-2 before performing the LIPS assays, since prior studies have 328 shown a marked loss in infectivity of SARS-CoV-1 [23, 32] and MERS [24] coronaviruses with 329 heat treatment. While impaired detection of viral IgM and IgG antibody responses to viruses 330 after heating samples to 56 o C has been reported [27], and several abstracts report similar findings 331 with SARS-CoV-2 samples, our direct comparison of untreated and treated samples found high 332 concordance of the antibody values revealing the suitability of heat inactivation. This 333 inactivation protocol may be useful to enhance safety when studying highly infectious saliva 334 from COVID-19 patients [11] for IgG and IgA antibodies. Further modification of LIPS assays 335 for detection of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, including the use of different protein fragments, full-336 length spike protein, and/or different luciferase reporters, may further improve assay 337 for use under a CC0 license.",
