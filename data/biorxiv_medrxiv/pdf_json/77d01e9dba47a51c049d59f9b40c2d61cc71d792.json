This study evaluated COVID-19 cases and mortality rates, integrating the data with reported socioeconomic measures by zip code. We demonstrate that zip codes with a greater proportion of residents above 65 years of age, African American residents, persons per household, and population density were significantly associated with an increased likelihood of COVID-19 cases. After sensitivity analysis, population density remained the factor most significantly associated with COVID-19 cases. These results highlight the importance of social distancing or lack thereof in poorer neighborhoods while giving early signals of racial inequalities which has been noted in other infectious disease and chronic disease epidemiology.

Like other preliminary reports, our analysis of the COVID-19 pandemic has also revealed age and race to be positive predictors in COVID-19 cases (6, 9) . However, when biologic factors such as age and race were held constant, like the HIV epidemic, we found other significant variables in the structural environment that impacted the rate of COVID-19 cases. The impact of socioeconomic disparities on health has been well documented and established, revealing that those with the lowest income and who were least educated were consistently least healthy (10, 11) , with correlations present down to the zip code level (12) . Our results suggest that even though race, age, and gender were noted initially, zip code level population density is most significant.",

Specifically, chronic conditions increase the risk of acquiring and dying from COVID-19 and in this study such adjustment was limited from such adjustments. Another metric about the number of positive cases may point towards discrepant testing/swab availability.
