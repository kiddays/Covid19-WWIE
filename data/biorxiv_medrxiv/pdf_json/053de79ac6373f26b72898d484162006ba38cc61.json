Many studies have been conducted to understand this 'unknown' new disease. Some studies have found that regional aggregated exposures (i.e., Bacillus Calmette-Guerin vaccination, air quality index) were correlated with regional aggregated COVID-19 outcomes (i.e., numbers of cases and deaths) [2] [3] [4] . Such type of studies using group-level data, rather than individual-level data, is typically called ecological studies 5 . While some ecological studies might be helpful in generating new hypotheses related to COVID-19, their results should be interpreted with cautions, as ecological studies by nature are sometimes more vulnerable to bias than studies using individual-level data.",

We studied three COVID-19 outcomes: confirmed number of cases per million people, confirmed number of deaths per million people, and case fatality rate defined as the proportion of deaths in confirmed cases. For each country, the distance to Brussels was defined as the direct distance (as the crow flies) from its capital to Brussels, and was measured using an online tool (https://www.freemaptools.com/how-far-is-it-between.htm).",
