One key aspect to transition safely out of lockdown is to continuously test the population for infected subjects. Currently, detection is performed at points of care using quantitative reverse-transcription PCR (RT-qPCR), and requires dedicated professionals and equipment. Here, we developed a protocol based on Reverse Transcribed Loop-Mediated Isothermal Amplification (RT-LAMP) for detection of SARS-CoV-2. This protocol is applied directly on SARS-CoV-2 nose and throat swabs, with no RNA purification step required. We tested this protocol on over 180 suspected patients, and compared its results to the standard method. We further succeeded to apply the protocol on self-sampled saliva from confirmed cases. Since the proposed protocol provides results on-the-spot, and can detect SARS-CoV-2 from saliva, it can allow simple and continuous surveillance of the community.",

The common and approved detection method worldwide requires professional experience in sampling, performing the reaction and analyzing the results. Moreover, it requires dedicated machines, and chemical reagents as well as sophisticated sample collection and transport logistics.

Such limited surveillance necessitates global and strict quarantine requirements, which threaten the global economy.",

However, anti-viral antibodies can be detected only several days after the infection onset, and can persist even after clearance of the virus.

These processes are time consuming, require multiple biochemical reagents, lab-grade instruments and trained professionals [3] .

LAMP is performed at a single and constant temperature allows a one-step reverse transcription and its results can be visualized by color change (for graphical presentation see Fig. 1a ). Due to the need for reverse transcription, this method is called reverse-transcribed (RT)-LAMP. Altogether, these advantages eliminate the need for sophisticated lab equipment [5] [6] [7] . Here, we adjusted RT-LAMP for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA directly from clinical diagnostic swabs of human patients, without RNA purification steps. The primers we used were previously designed and validated by Zhang et al. [4] (see primers table) . We studied samples from positive and negative patients for the SARS-CoV-2.

As in Zhang et. al., [4] the RT-LAMP results agreed with the standard RT-qPCR results (Fig. 1b) . To simplify the detection method, we sought to test the RT-LAMP reaction on clinical diagnostic throat and nose swabs from patients. These swabs were kept in universal transfer media (UTM). To these samples, we added an inactivation step by heating the UTM to 95\u00b0C for 5 minutes. Inactivated samples from confirmed patients were found to be positive by the RT-LAMP reaction (Fig. 1c) . We then evaluated this RT-LAMP protocol on a cohort of 99 patients that were tested at the hospital. This pool included 27 positive samples with a wide range of viral load and 72 negative samples. Samples were previously evaluated by the standard RT-qPCR test. The detection limit of this RT-LAMP protocol was at cycle threshold (Ct) of 27.8 (Fig. 1d, Supplementary Table 1 ), with 7 true positives (TP), 20 false negatives (FN), 72 true negatives (TN), and no false positives (FP) (Fig. 1e, Supplementary Table 1 ). Although there were no false positives, the rate of TP was very low. Hence, we were interested to improve the RT-LAMP protocol of detection from clinical diagnostic patient swabs. Since these swab samples may contain enzymatic inhibitors that might affect the efficiency of viral RNA detection, we have tested the addition of proteinase K and guanidine hydrochloride to the process. Proteinase K was added to the UTM sample taken from the original tube, and guanidine hydrochloride to the RT-LAMP reaction step. We first compared the two protocols on eight patients with low, medium and high Cts. Out of seven patients with positive results of RT-qPCR (Ct<37), two were clearly RT-LAMP positive in the former protocol and four in the new protocol. We concluded that these adjustments improved the RT-LAMP efficiency of viral RNA detection directly from clinical diagnostic swab samples ( fig. 1f ). Lastly, we tested samples from patients confirmed to be infected with viruses other than SARS-CoV-2. We tested a few patients that were previously confirmed to be infected by other viruses (HSV, RSV, Influenza and Enterovirus). As shown in figure 1g, this RT-LAMP reaction was negative for patients infected with these viruses, and positive for SARS-CoV-2.",

We were interested in finding the optimal incubation time to yield the best rate of true positives without increasing the rate of false negatives. We performed the RT-LAMP reaction for up to 40 minutes, and evaluated the colorimetric results at time-points 30, 35 and 40 minutes. With time, the number of TP increased, the number of FN decreased, with no change in the numbers of TN and with one FP throughout (Fig. 2a, Table 2 ). Hence, in these conditions, time-points 35 and 40 were better altogether. Figure 2c shows the results of the adjusted method at time point 40. These results were compared to the RT-qPCR Ct values of the same patients. RT-LAMP was most sensitive in detection of positive patients with viral load that corresponds to low and medium Ct values.

Saliva samples were self-collected from three different confirmed patients, and one suspected negative subject. In parallel, we also performed the standard RNA purification and RT-qPCR reactions in the hospital setting.

Our experiments were performed side-by-side to the standard RT-qPCR method at the hospital. We compared RT-qPCR Ct values to the RT-LAMP results of more than 180 different patients.

Following viral RNA extraction, RT-qPCR was performed using either of two commercial kits: (1) Allplex\u2122 2019-nCoV (Seegene); (2) Real-Time Fluorescent RT-PCR Kit for Detecting SARS-2019-nCoV (BGI), according to manufacturer's instructions. Additional RT-qPCR reaction mix was created manually, using custom made primers (Primers table) as follows: The probe IC was synthesized with a 5' FAM/CY5 Fluorophore moiety and 3' ZEN/IBFQ quencher. Each of the manual reactions was assembled in a total volume of 25 \u00b5l. 12.5\u00b5l 2X Ag-Path One-step mix (Ambion), 1 \u00b5l primers, 1\u00b5l of Reverse Transcriptase enzyme, 5 \u00b5l of the sample's RNA extracted previously and H 2 O to a final volume of 25 \u00b5l. All RT-qPCR reactions were executed in either of two systems: (1) Quantstudio (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc.) or (2) CFX96 RealTime PCR machines (Bio-Rad) under the following conditions: 30 minutes at 50 \u00b0C, 10 minutes at 95 \u00b0C and 45 cycles of two-step incubations: (1) 15 seconds at 95 \u00b0C ;",
