Healthcare workers around the world utilize N95 masks to protect themselves and their patients, yet during this global pandemic they are forced to re-wear what is intended to be single-use masks. This poses significant risk to these healthcare workers along with the populations they are trying to protect. Ultraviolet germicidal irradiation (UVGI) has been validated previously as a way to effectively sterilize these masks between use, however, not all facilities have access to the high cost commercial UV-C lamp sterilization equipment. However, UV-C bulbs are sitting idle in biosafety cabinets (BSCs) at universities and research facilities around the globe that have been shuttered to slow the spread of COVID-19. These bulbs may also be available in existing medical centers where infectious diseases are commonly treated. Therefore, we have developed a method to modify existing light fixtures, or create custom light fixtures compatible with new or existing common UV-C bulbs. This system is scalable and can be created for less than 50 US dollars, on site, at the point of need, and leverages resources that are currently untapped and sitting unused in public and private research facilities. The freely-accessible design can be easily modified for use around the world. Hospitals can obtain this potentially life-saving UVGI resource with minimal funds, via collaboration between research facilities to obtain the UV-C meters and limited availability UVGI bulbs. While mask reuse is not ideal, we must do what we can in emergency situations to protect our frontline healthcare workers and the communities they serve.",

            "text": "Front line health care workers (HCW) are critical to the care and treatment of individuals with the novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, or disease known as COVID- 19 . In addition to the needed beds and ventilators, personal protective equipment (PPE), particularly filtering facepiece respirators (FFRs), are essential to ensure the health and safety of not only trained doctors, nurses, and emergency response personnel, but also other hospital staff who play an important role in cleaning, disinfecting, and preparing spaces for patient care. Additionally, whereas much of the focus is on large hospitals and current hotspots without access to FFRs, also called N95 masks, SARS-CoV-2 will spread and affect residential facilities and rural clinics around the globe. These communities face additional challenges with limited resources and larger logistical obstacles to obtaining FFRs. And at the time of publication, shipping worn FFRs to localized centers for hydrogen peroxide vapor (HPV, also written as H2O2 vapor) sterilization was only available in very limited locations in the United States of America (U.S.) [1] [2] [3] . HPV sterilization is a U.S. Food & Drug Administration-approved method for N95 mask sterilization, and manufacturing and deployment of these systems is currently underway; however, the operational and coordination challenges associated with even localized deployment of HPV centers for N95 sterilization are significant. This is evidenced by contemporary reports of front-line HCWs being issued N95 masks for continuous (re)use over week-long time periods [4] [5] [6] . Additionally, Nebraska Medicine has initiated a U.S. Center for Disease Control (CDC) approved on-site ultraviolet germicidal irradiation (UVGI) sterilization system for N95 mask decontamination [7] . UVGI has been demonstrated to be effective at quickly sterilizing FFRs for viruses like the novel SARS-CoV-2, and for multiple cycles of sterilization [8] [9] [10] . Whereas UVGI sterilization has important limitations as discussed herein, these methods currently are being deployed as emergency procedures during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. The Nebraska Medicine protocol uses an operating room UVGI sterilization system to setup N95 mask decontamination, a system that many smaller clinics, rural hospitals and residential facilities may not have. We document procedures to build a similar type of UVGI irradiation platform with off-the-shelf components from the hardware store and UVGI bulbs sold online or from biosafety cabinets (class I, II, or III) that are ubiquitously found throughout academic research and industrial centers around the world. This system is scalable and can be created for less than 50 US dollars, on site, at the point of need, and leverages resources that are currently untapped and sitting unused in public and private research facilities that have shut down during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Hospitals can obtain this potentially life-saving UVGI resource with minimal funds, via collaboration between research facilities to obtain the UV-C meters and limited availability UVGI bulbs.",

            "text": "In contrast, many countries across the Global South rely heavily on a limited number of fullyresourced hospitals in urban centers, with varying degrees of professional healthcare access in rural areas. Current data on health facilities is difficult to find in many developing countries, however, we can find examples of the resource constraints. Kenya, for example, has 842 public and private hospitals serving over 53 million people [13, 14] . Just 24 of these facilities are classified as county and national referral hospitals, and large teaching and private hospitals. The remainder of Kenya's over 11,000 health facilities include smaller clinics, dispensaries, health centers, maternity wards and nursing homes, not to mention thousands of volunteer health care workers in rural communities. There are currently dramatic shortfalls in protective equipment in countries with relatively robust healthcare services, like the U.S., and these resources are even more precious in developing communities where fewer doctors and nurses are serving larger populations. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), \"Africa suffers more than 22% of the global burden of disease but has access to only 3% of healthcare workers, and less than 1% of the world's financial resources [15] .\" Losing a single doctor during this pandemic can have a detrimental impact on already strained healthcare systems across the continent [16] . Even in the U.S., rural clinics and hospitals serve patient populations sometimes across hundreds of miles, and in some areas, there is a single doctor for several thousand square miles [17] . Ensuring frontline HCWs around the world are protected as best possible is not only ethical, but imperative.",

Urban hospitals, while often having access to more resources due to the larger population they serve, experience a strain on their resources during a pandemic precisely because of the significantly larger numbers of people they need to urgently treat. Conversely, rural clinics and hospitals around the globe often have less funds to operate and face additional logistical challenges to provide patient access to care. Facilities cannot afford to have staff become ill and lead to a decrease in the number of HCW to treat patients, and therefore need proper FFRs to protect themselves. Additionally, HCWs can potentially spread infection if not properly equipped with essential FFRs, or if forced to reuse potentially contaminated masks. Many HCWs are currently facing the options of not wearing an essential mask, constructing makeshift FFRs with limited efficacy, or re-wearing a soiled mask -the majority are choosing the latter. This is an unprecedented world-wide shortage of life-saving equipment that our HCWs and beyond need in order to continue serving their communities. In addition to traditional healthcare workers, essential personnel working in pharmaceuticals, dentistry, custodial services, delivery services and law enforcement also require protection while they keep operations afloat. A global shortage of N95 masks is expected to persevere due to supply chain challenges, especially for one essential component: the melt-blown polypropylene fabric material that filters infectious diseases like the coronavirus during inhalation by the wearer [18] . Distributed systems for N95 sterilization are needed to keep up with demand.",

A model of a hypothetical influenza pandemic predicted 1.7 to 7.3 billion respirators would be required if only 20-30% of the U.S. population were to be infected [20] . This does not account for non-HCWs, such as law enforcement officers and other essential personnel who may require respiratory protection.

The inability to scale N95 manufacturing at the rate needed to meet current demand during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has necessitated the reuse of N95 respirators among healthcare workers. Work has shown that pathogens such as viruses can contaminate and exist for extended periods of time on the outer surface of N95 masks [21] . Beyond the risk to HCWs in storing and reusing what is intended to be single-use PPE, other at-risk patients could be exposed to the virus when consulting with a HCW reusing their PPE that was previously used with a COVID19-positive patient. It should be noted that simply re-donning N95 masks alone poses serious risk to the user due to loss of strap elasticity, nose fit, and therefore, mask integrity, after repeated re-donning. Due to need, re-donning is already occurring, and these masks have the potential to be contaminated with viral particles, risking further spread of virus.",

The recently established N95DECON website (https://www.n95decon.org) gives a good summary of these methods, including current understandings and limitations to consider for each method. The FDA has approved hydrogen peroxide-based sterilization via one U.S. company, Battelle, in the state of Ohio. While an excellent resource, the procedure relies on shipment of contaminated masks to Ohio for sterilization [23, 24] and/or the production of such HPV sterilization equipment for regional deployment. The ability for hospitals and care workers to sterilize their own masks in minutes, as opposed to days, is a great advantage in the use of UVGI.",

            "text": "UVGI as a method for FFR/N95 sterilization UVGI systems have been used throughout the healthcare industry to sterilize work environments such as surgical suites, equipment, and ambulances. Single stranded RNA (ssRNA) viruses, like the novel SARS-CoV-2, are especially susceptible to UV sterilization [8] . Previous work has shown that UVGI systems can also be used to sterilize N95 masks by reducing the viability of the influenza virus, also a ssRNA virus, by 3 log [9] . A very recent small study has shown that UV is capable of sterilizing N95 mask fabric contaminated with SARS-CoV-2 [25] . There is variable effectiveness of UVGI depending on the mask manufacturer, the different materials of the mask (polypropylene filter vs rubber strap), and the medium in which the virus resides (in liquid, in air, on surface). UVGI sterilization also runs the risk of damaging the materials of the N95 masks which can compromise the integrity of the mask and its usefulness in filtering particles and acting as an effective piece of PPE. A variety of studies have looked at the effect of UVGI on mask integrity [26, 27] , even with repeated exposure [10, 22, [28] [29] [30] , and have found no significant increase in viral penetration, nor decreases in mask stability, even at UVGI doses >10,000x the required dose to effectively reduce influenza infectivity [31] . In other studies, three UVGI cycles of 1.6-2.0 mW/cm 2 for 15 min did not cause significant changes in respirator fit [28] , and there was no change in filtration performance [29] . However, with UVGI sterilization of N95 masks, careful monitoring of UV dosage and the number of times a single mask is sterilized is important to minimize damaging the integrity of the mask. Table 1 provides a summary of current literature related to UVGI sterilization of N95 mask, mainly in the context of influenza. Importantly, the CDC has approved the protocol from Nebraska for UVGI sterilization during the COVID-19 pandemic.",

For a single bulb, the highest irradiation will be achieved along the midline and will rapidly decay with increasing irradiation width (w) (Figure 1B) . We used a UV meter (attenuation \u03bb=254nm) to measure the irradiation area at discrete points using our modified fixture outfitted with a single UV-C bulb (G30T8 with 13.4W UV output) taken from an existing BSC. The bulb was 88cm long, placed 15cm above the UV-C meter sensor. We tested areas along the midline and 20cm away from the bulb's midline in either direction. The highest irradiation was along the midline directly under the bulb and the UV intensities decay, as expected, with increasing irradiation width (w) (Figure 1B, C) . Importantly, these measurements demonstrate two points. Firstly, the model is a conservative prediction of the intensity distribution, and thus can be used to inform bulb configuration geometries described herein. Secondly, that the bulb intensity is not uniform along its length. Both of these details reinforce the need for user-developed designs and configurations to be validated with UV-C meter measurements to determine the minimum values of UV intensity over the exposure area to calculate exposure times needed in individual configurations.",

If placed in close enough proximity, the two light fixtures will create an irradiation overlap region which will increase the irradiation intensity to reduce the time needed to sterilize (Figure 2A) . By modeling the theoretical irradiation curves following thermal radiation view factors [36] , we can determine the effects of adjusting the bulb spacing on the mask sterilization throughput capacity. For our single bulb set-up, using irradiation width w=20cm, processing 18 masks in an array, the sterilization time is 19.4 minutes per side and thus can sterilize 27.9 masks/hr ( Figure 2B) . This time is determined by the lowest intensity measured in our array where the intensity is approximately 26% that at the midline. However, if we use a modified commercial light fixture outfitted with two UV bulbs, the bulbs are closely spaced resulting in high overlap in UV light and the peak intensity of UV is notably increased ( Figure  2C ). This geometry can either produce a larger (wider) irradiation width for the same exposure time from 20cm to 29cm to increase mask throughput, or we can keep the irradiation width the same and yield a higher UV intensity. A higher UV intensity decreases the exposure time required and increases mask throughput. Although counterintuitive, Figure 2C demonstrates highest mask throughput (59.6 masks/hr compared to 37.2 masks/hr) by keeping the irradiation field constant (i.e. fewer masks at once) and having a higher UV intensity to decrease exposure time. These measurements and calculations are for a single modified, existing, commercial two-bulb light fixture.",

            "text": "While having two bulbs in a commercial fixture increases throughput over a single bulb, taking advantage of off-the-shelf components to build your own custom fixture has significant advantages. Specifically, users can optimize bulb spacing to increase the uniformity of the irradiation field. If two bulbs are spaced at the 50% irradiation width intensity for a single bulb, the UV intensities are additive which creates a more constant irradiation field ( Figure 2D ). Using this configuration, the irradiation width is considerably increased from 20cm to 34.5cm for a mask exposure time of 19.4 minutes/side. This generates a mask sterilization throughput of 46.4 masks per hour. However, similar to findings from the off-the-shelf fixture, keeping the irradiation area constant to take advantage of the higher UV intensities, will increase mask throughput more substantially. This approach reduces sterilization time to 5.9 minutes per side, and yields a throughput of 91.3 masks/hr for a system with lights only on one side of the masks. This represents a greater than 3x increase in mask processing from a single UVGI bulb. If a system is created with simultaneous exposure to front and back sides of the masks, using two UVGI bulbs on each side, a user could process 182.6 masks/hr. Choosing an optimal set up will all depend on the resources at hand, such as fixtures, bulbs, and treatment environments. A significant advantage of this system is the potential for parallelization of numerous UVGI light fixtures to simply scale the N95 mask treatment throughput.",
