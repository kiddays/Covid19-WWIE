In the absence of a vaccine 4 or any proven therapeutic agent, hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) and azithromycin (AZ), 5 often used in combination, have emerged as a potential therapy based on extremely HCQ is an anti-malarial drug which has also been used to treat arthritis and systemic 10 lupus erythematosus. AZ is a macrolide antibiotic used to treat a wide variety of 11 bacterial infections. Both drugs prolong the QT interval by blocking the KCNH2-encoded 12 hERG/Kv11.1 cardiac potassium channel, thereby increasing the risk of torsades des 13 pointes. [5] [6] [7] In general, HCQ is reasonably well-tolerated and used chronically in arthritis 14 and SLE patients without heart rhythm monitoring. 8 In 2013, the FDA issued a black 15 warning for AZ following multiple reported cases of QTc prolongation followed by 16 torsades des pointes. 9 Since the use of these drugs in COVID-19 patients is so recent 17 and based largely on in vitro studies 10 and anecdotal observations 11 , community 18 prescribing practices are as-yet unclear. More importantly, there is no information 19 available regarding the extent of QTc prolongation with a combination of HCQ and AZ. 20 From first principles, simultaneous block of the hERG/Kv11.1 cardiac potassium 21 channel with both agents may cause critical QTc prolongation and an elevated risk of 22 torsades des pointes.

Given variability in heart rates, QTc 4 prolongation was also evaluated using the Fridericia formula for correction of the QT 5 interval. QT measurements were independently reviewed and validated by a 6 cardiologist to ensure accuracy of the automatic measurement and manually re-7 measured if needed. Patients were assigned into to one of 3 three groups depending on 8 which medication they received -AZ, HCQ, or AZ + HCQ. Patient demographics, 9 clinical history, labs, and medications were obtained from detailed chart review, 10 including risk factors to calculate the Tisdale score 12 and the Elixhauser comorbidity 11 index 13 for each patient. The Tisdale score consists of age \u2265 68 yrs, female sex, use of 12 loop diuretics, potassium level \u2264 3.5 mEq/L, baseline QTc \u2265 450 ms, acute MI, number 13 of QT prolonging medications, sepsis, and heart failure and has been developed as a 14 risk score for QTc interval prolongation.
