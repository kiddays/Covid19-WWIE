            "text": "On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) characterized COVID-19 as a pandemic. Since then, the virus has infected exponentially more men and women worldwide. As of April 19, the WHO reports 2,241,359 confirmed cases and 152,551 deaths (WHO, 2020) . This is more than double the deaths reported on April 6 (WHO, 2020b), indicating that the burden of COVID-19 is currently doubling approximately every 13 days. Countries have implemented a range of responses, and many are imposing nationwide school closures. These currently affect over 1.5 billion (almost 90%) of the world's students (WHO, 2020b) . But closing school is costly-$10 to $47 billion for 4 weeks in the US alone (Lempel et al. 2009 )-and could lead to a greater number of deaths than they prevent by creating unintended downstream effects, such as child-care obligations and losses in health-care workforce capacity (Bayham and Fenichel, 2020) . Other countries have focused on other interventions, such as contact tracing and case isolation. These have been estimated to be 4,363 times more cost-effective than school closures for H1N1 influenza ($2,260 vs. $9,860,000 per death prevented) (Madhav et al. 2017) . As states in the US and around the world are faced with the challenge of balancing public health interventions with economic (and other) considerations, evidence on the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of these interventions is urgently needed to guide policy and avoid unnecessary harm. In this rapid systematic review, we aimed to provide a comprehensive summary of the evidence on epidemic control and to identify cost-effective interventions in the context of COVID-19.",

Randomized trial evidence was only available for the effectiveness of hand washing and face masks (Jefferson et al. 2011; Smith et al. 2015; MacIntyre et al. 2015; Saunders-Hastings et al. 2017) . For other interventions, only lower-quality evidence was available (observational and modelling studies). treatment (cost-effective), antiviral prophylaxis (cost-effective), low efficiency vaccination (costeffective if timed before cases peak), high efficiency vaccination (cost-effective if timed before cases peak), stockpiling antiviral medicine (cost-effective for high-income countries), quarantining confirmed cases at home (cost-effective for viruses with a case fatality rate of 1%, not cost-effective for viruses with a case fatality rate of 0.25%), self-isolation at home (costeffective with a case fatality rate of 1%, not cost-effective with a case fatality rate of 0.25%), and school closure (not cost-effective). For H1N1 influenza, contact tracing was estimated to be 4,363 times more cost-effective than school closures ($2,260 vs. $9,860,000 per death prevented) (Madhav et al. 2017 ). Indeed, Lempel et al. (2009 estimated that closing all schools in the US for 4 weeks would cost $10 to $47 billion (0.1-0.3% of GDP). Other systematic reviews found that school closures did not contribute to the control of the 2003 SARS epidemic in China, Hong Kong, and Singapore and would prevent only 2-4% of COVID-19 deaths (Viner et al. 2020) ; reduced the peak of epidemics by 29.65% on average and were more effective when timed early (Bin Nafisah et al. 2018) ; would be most effective if they caused large reductions in contact, if transmissibility was low (e.g. a basic reproduction number <2), and if attack rates were higher in children than in adults (Jackson et al. 2014) ; and appeared to be moderately effective in reducing the transmission of influenza and in delaying the peak of an epidemic, but were associated with very high costs (Rashid et al. 2015) .

Saunders-Hastings et al. (2017) carried out a systematic review and meta-analysis of personal protective measures to reduce pandemic influenza transmission. They did not find any study evaluating respiratory etiquette (e.g. covering the mouth during coughing). Meta-analyses suggested that regular hand hygiene provided a significant protective effect (OR = 0.62; 95% CI 0.52-0.73). Face masks had a non-significant protective effect (OR = 0.53; 95% CI 0.16-1.71) which became significant (OR = 0.41; 95% CI 0.18-0.92) when randomized control trials and cohort studies were pooled with case-control studies (this also decreased heterogeneity). In an earlier systematic review, Jefferson et al. (2011) also found a protective effect of masks. Overall, they were the best performing intervention across populations, settings, and threats. Similarly, in a narrative review, MacIntyre et al. (2015) drew on evidence from randomized community trials to conclude that face masks do provide protection against infection in various community settings, subject to compliance and early use. Differences in publication date, search strategy, and study selection criteria may explain the discrepancies among these reviews. Tracht et al. (2012) estimated savings of $573 billion if 50% of the US population used masks in an unmitigated H1N1 epidemic. For hand washing, Townsend et al. (2017) estimated that a national behaviour change program in India would net $5.6 billion (3.4-8.6), a 92-fold return on investment.

This combination included treatment and household prophylaxis using antiviral drugs and limited duration school closure. If antiviral drugs are not available, limited duration school closure was significantly more cost-effective compared to continuous school closure. Other social distancing strategies, such as reduced workplace attendance, were found to be costly due to productivity losses. Closing school for 2 to 4 weeks without other interventions did not cost much more than doing nothing but gave a significant 34% to 37% reduction in cases \"if optimally timed\". The authors examined timing in another study, in which the effectiveness of school closures were analyzed for durations of 2, 4 and 8 weeks (Halder et al. 2010) . They found that the most appropriate strategy depended on the virus' severity and transmissibility. For mild viruses, they concluded that individual school closures should begin once daily new cases reach 10 to 50.

Lee et al. (2009) carried out a systematic review of modelling studies quantifying the effectiveness of strategies for pandemic influenza response. They found that combinations of strategies increased the effectiveness of individual strategies and could reduce their potential negative impact. Combinations delayed spread, reduced overall number of cases, and delayed and reduced peak attack rate more than individual strategies. Pan et al. (2020) examined associations between public health interventions and the epidemiology of COVID-19 in Wuhan, China. Traffic restrictions, cancellation of social gatherings, and home quarantines were associated with reduced transmission, but were not sufficient to prevent increases in confirmed cases. These were reduced and estimates of the effective reproduction number fell below 1 only when additional interventions were implemented. Those included hospital-based measures (designated hospitals and wards, use of personal protective equipment, increased testing capacity and accelerated reporting, and timely medical treatment) and community-based interventions (quarantine of confirmed and presumptive cases and of close contacts in designated facilities).",

They found 24 studies and cautiously concluded that there is some evidence to indicate that mass gatherings may be associated with an increased risk of influenza transmission. In a more recent systematic review, Rainey et al. (2016) found that mass gathering-related respiratory disease outbreaks were relatively rare between 2005 and 2014 in the US. They concluded that this could suggest-perhaps surprisingly-low transmission at most types of gatherings, even during pandemics. Similarly, in a US survey of 50 state health departments and 31 large local health departments, Figueroa et al. (2017) found that outbreaks at mass gatherings were uncommon, even during the 2009 H1N1 pandemic. In a modelling study, Shi et al. (2010) found that mass gatherings that occur within 10 days before the epidemic peak can result in a 10% relative increase in peak prevalence and total attack rate. Conversely, they found that mass gatherings may have little effect when occurring more than 40 days earlier or 20 days later than the infection peak (when initial Ro = 1.5). Thus the timing of mass gatherings might explain the apparent lack of evidence in support of their ban.",

Using location-based data, they estimated that each increase of 100 in daily new cases and daily passengers departing from Wuhan was associated with an increase of 16.25% (95% CI: 14.86-17.66%) in daily new cases outside of Wuhan. Ryu et al. (2020) conducted a systematic review of international travel restrictions, screening of travelers, and border closure. They examined 15 studies and concluded that the evidence did not support entry screening as an effective measure, and that travel restrictions and border closures would have limited effectiveness in controlling pandemic influenza. In another systematic review, Mateus et al. (2014) concluded that the evidence did not support travel restrictions as an isolated intervention for the containment of influenza, and that restrictions would be \"extremely limited\" in containing the emergence of a pandemic virus. Chinazzi et al. (2020) used a global disease transmission model to project the impact of travel limitations on the spread of COVID-19. They estimated that the travel quarantine of Wuhan delayed the overall epidemic progression by 3 to 5 days in Mainland",
