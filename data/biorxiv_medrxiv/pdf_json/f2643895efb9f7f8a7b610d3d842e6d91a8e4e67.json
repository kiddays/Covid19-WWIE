In recent years, fractal analysis has become a powerful nonlinear tool to extract information from physiological data not visible to the naked eye. It can present, however, some dangerous pitfalls that can lead to misleading interpretations. To calculate the HFD and the H, we have extracted muscle synergies from normal and mechanically perturbed treadmill locomotion from the 25 hindlimb of adult mice. Then, we used one set per condition (normal and perturbed walking) of the obtained time-dependent coefficients to create surrogate data with different fluctuations over the original mean signal. Our analysis shows that HFD and H are exceptionally sensitive to the presence or absence of perturbations to locomotion. However, both metrics suffer from variations in their value depending on the parameters used for calculations and the presence of 30 quasi-periodic elements in the time series. We discuss those issues giving some simple suggestions to reduce the chance of misinterpreting the outcomes.",

However, after collecting the data there always remains the issue of finding convenient and informative ways of analyzing it. For instance, electromyogram (EMG) recordings from multiple muscles are widely used for their important role in the study of locomotion (Bizzi et al. 2008) . Despite their intuitive meaning (a muscle is either active or inactive and thus either does or does not produce a recordable signal), EMG recordings contain 50 complex features that might not always be detectable and/or quantifiable by traditional analysis methods. To uncover these local or global features of the signal, many linear and nonlinear approaches exist (Kantz and Schreiber 2004; Ting et al. 2015) .

And 2) what are the potential pitfalls -and ways to avoid them -of using those metrics? Nature exhibits similar patterns at different scales. A snowflake, when looked through a magnifying glass, shows shapes comparable to those visible to the naked eye. And so do the 60 branches of a tree, the coastline of an island, the course of a river, and many other natural or artificial entities (Mandelbrot 1983) . Using mathematics, it is possible to build some geometric constructs that have the property of repeating themselves at every level of zoom, again and again. In other words, they are self-similar (Mandelbrot 1983 ). Such constructs have been called \"fractals\" by the mathematician Benoit B. Mandelbrot (Mandelbrot 1983) .

As shown in the detail of Fig. 1A , the Koch curve repeats itself at every level of zoom: a demonstration of self-similarity. Mandelbrot, following the empirical work of yet another mathematician, Lewis Fry Richardson, asked himself whether it would be possible to quantify the \"degree of complication\" of such curves (Mandelbrot 1967; Richardson 70 1961) . If in Euclidean geometry a line has dimension 1 and a plane has dimension 2, why not assigning a \"fractional\" (or fractal) dimension to a curve that is neither a straight line nor, say, a filled rectangle (Mandelbrot 1967) ? Since the seminal work of Mandelbrot, the term \"fractal analysis\" has been used to denote a wide range of approaches, some of them pre-existing, that deal with self-similar entities (Mandelbrot 1983) . 75 Fractal analysis has been used, amongst other disciplines, in hydrology (Hurst 1951), geography (Mandelbrot 1967) , genetics (Peng et al. 1994) , neuroscience (Lutzenberger et al. 1992) , finance (Mandelbrot 1997) , physiology and medicine (Losa et al. 2005) , biomechanics (Scafetta et al. 2009 ), and seismography (Flores-Marquez et al. 2012) . For instance, it can be used to predict stock market shifts and an example is given in Fig. 1B . Here it is shown the daily stock closing 80 price (NASDAQ Composite 2020) of Twitter, a popular social media amongst scientists (Cheplygina et al. 2020) . Due to the SARS-CoV-2 and related COVID-19 outbreak (WHO 2020), after around 60 working days of positive trend, the stock price started to oscillate only to fall drastically by 44% in just 19 working days. The Hurst exponent (H, a metric for fractal analysis, see details in the methods and caption of Fig. 1 ) values reported in Fig. 1B , show the 85 increasing and decreasing trends before and after the COVID-19 crisis with 0.5 < H < 1.",

Here, we propose to use HFD and H as descriptors of changes in EMG-related time series when external perturbations are added to mouse locomotion. We show the sensitivity of the HFD and 105 H to well defined changes caused by targeted manipulation of surrogate data (Dingwell and Cusumano 2000; Theiler et al. 1992) . Moreover, we investigated the sensitivity of the HFD and H to physiological changes in motor primitives caused by external perturbations.

For the calculation of H, the smallest window was set to half the length of the considered interval. 0.5 < H < 1 indicates persistence (negative or positive trend, e.g. that of the inreasing prices between day 615 and 672), while 0 < H < 0.5 indicates anti-persistence (no trend or oscillation around a mean value, e.g. when considering the whole time series from day 1 to 712 or in the case of EMG recordings from locomotion).

Five adult wild-type mice (age 67 \u00b1 8 days) with C57BL/6 background walked at 0.3 m/s on a custom-built treadmill (workshop of the Zoological Institute, University of Cologne) capable to administer perturbations through quick mediolateral displacements and accelerations of the belt. EMG data was recorded from the hindlimb as previously reported (Akay et al. 2014; 130 Santuz et al. 2019) . Basic muscle activation patterns, or motor primitives (Dominici et al. 2011; Santuz et al. 2017) , were extracted from EMG using the muscle synergies approach (Bernstein 1967; Bizzi et al. 1991 ) via non-negative matrix factorization (Lee and Seung 1999; 2019) using custom R scripts (R v3.6.3, R Core Team, 2020, R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria). Of the extracted primitives, we arbitrarily chose one for normal 135 and one for perturbed walking, both representative of all five recorded animals. The two time series had the same length (i.e. 6000 data points, see Fig. 2A -B) and described one of the basic muscle activation patterns extracted from 30 gait cycles. Each cycle was time-normalized to 200 points (Santuz et al. 2019) : 100 points assigned to the stance (when the limb was in contact with the ground) and 100 to the swing phase (when the limb was swinging in the air). 140",

This means that when we record some physiological parameters such as muscle activity, their behavior in time will not be as regular as that of a sinusoidal function, but it will likely be close enough to allow the identification of similar cycles (e.g. the steps or the strides). The time series considered in this 255 study have been time-normalized to 200 points assigned to each gait cycle. Thus, their period is 200. As it is visible in Fig. 2 , the quasi-periodicity becomes more evident when shifting the attention from BSLN (Fig. 2C-D) to BSLN50 (Fig. 2E-F ) and, ultimately, BSLN10 (Fig. 2G-H) .",

In order to work around those issues, we suggest to: a) calculate HFD by using only the most linear part of the log-log plot, which in our case correspond to maximum the first 10 data points, and b) 305 calculate H by using a smallest window bigger than the period given by the length of the individual gait cycles.",

Due to the lack of consensus in the 265 literature on how to choose the maximum window length (what is often called k max ) and select the most linear part of the log-log curve (Kesi\u0107 and Spasi\u0107 2016), extreme care should be taken when calculating the HFD of quasi-periodic time series. It is not surprising that some authors suggest to only consider the first two points in the log-log plot, so as to make sure that the selected portion is trivially linear (Gneiting et al. 2012). Moreover, a discontinuity appeared in 270 the neighborhood of the 200 th time point, bigger in normal as compared to perturbed walking and increasing from BSLN to BSLN10. This discontinuity is responsible for a sharp increase in the slope (which is the HFD) of the regression lines that include it, with an effect that increases with the \"regularity\" of the time series. This is due to the definition of the Higuchi's length (Higuchi 1988), which tends to zero when taken between two points that have close ordinate component 275 or, in other words, when it is almost horizontal in the example of Fig. 3B (G\u00e1lvez Coyt et al. 2013; Liehr and Massopust 2020).",

For self-similar series, the fractal dimension is 2-H (Mandelbrot 1985), thus lower H (or higher HFD, as stated above and in the methods) indicate more irregular or complex data (Higuchi 1988; Kesi\u0107 and Spasi\u0107 2016). For self-affine series such as those treated in this study, fractal dimension and H are not necessarily linearly correlated and can exhibit 290 different local and global values (Gneiting and Schlather 2004; Mandelbrot 1997). In the words of Gneiting and Schlather (Gneiting and Schlather 2004): \"[\u2026] fractal dimension and Hurst coefficient are independent of each other: fractal dimension is a local property, and longmemory dependence is a global characteristic.\". In fact, if the data shows any short-range dependence as in this case, it is commonly suggested to exclude the low end of the plot for the 295 estimation of H (Taqqu et al. 1995).",
