According to Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) Situation Report-82 published by WHO, the total number of infected people approached to 2 million. However, in the same report WHO states that the true-number of the infected people might be higher than the number of the confirmed cases. Many researched have been published in order to analyse and to understand the dynamics of the Covid-19 pandemic [9, 13, 5, 14, 7, 10, 6] . Guiliani et al. [8] proposed a multivariate time-series linear model in order to understand and estimate the spatio-temporal diffusion of the Covid-19 pandemic in Northern Italy. It is stated that the proposed model is capable of to predict with an error of 3% compared to the late available data in Italy. Kucharski et al. [11] developed a mathematical model to understand the early dynamics of the transmission of the Covid-19 pandemic. They divided the entire population into four subsets as; susceptible, exposed, infectious, and removed.",

The transition probabilities of the proposed nonlinear Markov chains model between the states are illustrated in Figure  1 . Since the state-3 is an absorbing state, p 33 is assigned as 1. The remaining entries of the transition matrix P , i.e p ij , have been calculated based on the confirmed daily number of Covid-19 cases and the daily test numbers of the corresponding countries. The related website of John Hopkins University [2] has been used in order to get data in accordance with [1] . The number of the daily new cases, the number of Covid-19 test done, the number of the recovered cases, and the number of daily deaths have been used as the proposed model parameters affecting on the transition probabilities between the predefined states. The data obtained from China is employed to developed the model. The daily new Covid-19 cases and the corresponding estimation of the proposed nonlinear Markov chain model is illustrated in Figure 2 . In China, the confirmed new daily Covid-19 cases on 11 February 2020, which is the 21 st day after the first case was reported on 22 nd January 2020, is assumed as a deviation from the model due to the test policy.",
