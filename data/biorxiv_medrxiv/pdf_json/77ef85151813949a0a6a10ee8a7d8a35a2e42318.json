Likewise, in the absence of knowledge of subclinical or asymptomatic forms of the infection, it is not possible to estimate infection fatality rates (IFR) except through mathematical modelling. 3 However, population-based serological investigations use serologic assays to determine infection attack rates (IAR) in the population in an epidemic area, and are able to determine the proportion of subclinical and asymptomatic infections. This information is key for a better understanding of SARS-CoV-2 circulation, more precise estimates of fatality rates, and calibration of mathematical models used to forecast the dynamics of the ongoing epidemic.",

Nevertheless, the overall findings were consistent with the literature to date in terms of the overall age-standardised CFR, hospitalisation rate, predictive values of symptoms such as ageusia and anosmia, and the possible effect of school closure on respiratory viruses epidemic dynamics. 3, 9, 10 The clinical findings of our investigation were also limited by the fact that symptoms were retrospectively self-reported, in the absence of clinical evaluation, and that other respiratory viruses were presumably circulating at that time in the study population.",

We selected three serological methods with high (>99%) specificity, so that a positive signal with any of the three tests would be considered as a true positive. 6 This, combined with the very high sensitivity of one of the three methods, the S-Flow assay, suggests that we were able to capture most if not all individuals with antibodies. A further concern relates to the antibody kinetics of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Most patients seroconvert within two weeks after onset of symptoms, but it is not clear whether time to seroconversion may be longer in patients with asymptomatic or subclinical infection. 5 In such case, our estimate of the IAR might be an underestimate of the true one. Still, with a lockdown in place more than four weeks before the blood sampling, we believe that time to seroconversion has been sufficient for the majority of infected individuals. One important knowledge gap remains the extent to which the antibodies detected in this study would be immunoprotective. In the absence of this knowledge, we suggest that barrier measures and social distancing continue to apply the same way for people with and without antibodies.",

While this proportion may seem low, despite circulation of the virus in the region, this fraction is likely to be lower than the true seroprevalence among adults in the region for a number of reasons. Blood donors tend to be more \"health conscious\"; they are not allowed to give blood if they have been ill in the month before; and tend to refrain from donating blood if a family member was recently ill. Nonetheless, tracking seropositivity in blood donors over time gives an indication of the trend in antibody dynamics in the general population, and for this reason, has been used effectively in previous epidemics, including pandemic H1N1 influenza 19 and Zika virus. 20 Repeated serologic testing for anti-SARS-COV-2 antibodies in blood donor populations needs to continue, in both affected and unaffected areas.",

Overall, the findings of this study have important implications for public health measures and outbreak investigations specific to COVID-19. The overall IAR of 25.9% in a community living within the epicentre of the epidemic in France, and the low prevalence of antibodies among blood donors in the vicinity suggest that herd immunity will not be established quickly. Other areas of France, where the virus has not circulated, remain immunologically naive to the virus. Since 17 March 2020, the French government has implemented public health measures to restrict movement of individuals outside their home. The findings of this study suggest that lifting these confinement measures may be long and complex. For this reason, effective therapeutics treatments and vaccines specific to SARS-CoV-2 are urgently needed.",

Further investigation established no fatalities among the 1262 members of the high school population since the beginning of the study period. Of the 661 participants, 171 participants had anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies (see Supplementary material), giving an overall IAR of 25.9% (95% confidence interval (CI); 22.6-29.4), and an infection fatality rate (IFR) of 0% (one-sided 97.5% CI = 0 -2.1). Nine of the ten hospitalised were in the SARS-CoV-2 infected group, giving a hospitalisation rate of 5.3% (95% CI = 2.4 -9.8). The median age of hospitalised participants was higher compared to non-hospitalised in the SARS-CoV-2 infected group (49.0 versus 17.7 years, respectively; P = 0.04). Among the 171 participants with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, the proportions of those with major, minor or no symptoms were 70.8% (95% CI = 63.3-77.5), 12.3% (95% CI = 7.8-18.2), and 17.0% (95% CI = 11.2 -23.4), respectively.",
