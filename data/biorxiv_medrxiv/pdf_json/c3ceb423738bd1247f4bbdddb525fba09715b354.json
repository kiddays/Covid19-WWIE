            "text": "The entire world has recently witnessed the commencement of coronavirus disease 19 pandemic. It is caused by a novel coronavirus (n-CoV) generally distinguished as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). It has exploited human vulnerabilities to coronavirus outbreak. SARS-CoV-2 promotes fatal chronic respiratory disease followed by multiple organ failure which ultimately puts an end to human life. No proven vaccine for n-CoV is available till date in spite of significant research efforts worldwide. International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) has reached to a consensus that the virus SARS-CoV-2 is highly genetically similar to Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV) outbreak of 2003. It has been reported that SARS-CoV has ~89% genetic similarities with n-CoV. With this hypothesis, the current work focuses on the identification of spreader nodes in SARS-CoV protein interaction network. Various network characteristics like edge ratio, neighborhood density and node weight have been explored for defining a new feature spreadability index by virtue of which spreader nodes and edges are identified. The selected top spreader nodes having high spreadability index have been also validated by Susceptible-Infected-Susceptible (SIS) disease model. Initially, the proposed method is applied on a synthetic protein interaction network followed by SARS-CoV-human protein interaction network. Hence, key spreader nodes and edges (ranked edges) are unmasked in SARS-CoV proteins and its connected level 1 and level 2 human proteins. The new network attribute spreadability index along with generated SIS values of selected top spreader nodes when compared with the other network centrality based methodologies like Degree centrality (DC), Closeness centrality (CC), Local average centrality (LAC) and Betweeness centrality (BC) is found to perform relatively better than the existing-state-of-art.",

Nevertheless SARS-CoV-2 is under the same Betacoronavirus genus as that of MERS and SARS coronavirus [12] . It comprises of several structural and non-structural proteins. The structural proteins includes the envelope (E) protein, membrane (M) protein, nucleocapsid (N) protein and the spike (S) protein. Though SARS-CoV-2 has been identified recently but there is an intense scarcity of data as well as necessary information needed to gain immunity against SARS-CoV-2. Studies has revealed the fact that SARS-CoV-2 is highly genetically similar to SARS-CoV based on several experimental genomic analyses [9], [12]- [14] .

But since SARS-CoV-2 PPIN is still not available, SARS-CoV PPIN is considered for this research study due to its high genetic similarity with SARS-CoV-2. In the proposed methodology, at first SARS-CoV-Human PPIN (up to level 2) is formed from the collected datasets [25] - [27] . Once it is formed, spreader nodes are identified in each of SARS-CoV proteins, its level 1 and level 2 of human network by the application of a new network attribute i.e. spreadability index which is a combination of three terminologies: 1) edge ratio [28] 2) neighborhood density [28] and 3) node weight [29] . The detected spreader nodes are also validated by the existing SIS epidemic disease model [30] . Then the edges connecting two spreader nodes are ranked based on the average of spreadability index of spreader nodes themselves to access to the spreading ability of the corresponding edge. The ranked edges thus highlight the path of entire disease propagation from SARS-CoV to human level 1 and then from human level 1 to human level 2 proteins.",

In this research work, SARS-CoV takes the role of the former while human later. SARS-CoV first transmits infection to its corresponding interaction human proteins which in turn affect its next level of proteins. So, the transmission occurs through connected nodes and edges. Not all the nodes or proteins in the PPIN transmit infection. So, proper identification of nodes transmitting infection (spreader nodes) is required. It is simultaneously also true that the transmission is not possible without the edges connecting two spreader nodes. Thus these connecting edges are called spreader edges.

This node has been correctly ranked by all the methods except LAC and DC. Node 24 though has moderate edge ratio and node weight, but is one of the most densely connected modules itself in spite of getting isolated from the main network module of node 1. Moreover, node 24 has the highest neighborhood density. It establishes the fact that the only path of transmission for nodes 26, 27, 25, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32 and 33 is node 24. Thus if node 24 gets affected, then all the connected nodes with it will be immediately affected due to the lack of the connectivity of the neighbors with other central nodes. So, node 24 holds the second position with respect to spreadability index in our proposed methodology. Node 24 is not properly identified as the second most influential spreader nodes by the other methods.

SIS actually refers to Susceptible, Infected and Susceptible states which are generally considered as the three probable states of a protein in a PPIN. 1) S -The susceptible proteins who are not yet infected but are at risk for getting infected. In general every protein in PPIN is initially in susceptible state. 2) I -Infected proteins who are infected and are capable of transmitting the disease to other proteins. 3) S -proteins who have recovered and again become susceptible. Infection rate of the network, recovery rate ( general assumption is any one out of the infected proteins gets recovered in one day) and total number of proteins are usually provided as input to SIS. If a protein gets infected and it has many neighbors, then any neighbor can get infected or may not be. So the final result is generated after 50 iterations for each infected protein. The total number of susceptible proteins after 50 iterations in the neighborhood of each infected protein divided by the total number of proteins in the network gives the infection capability of the infected protein. Thus the spreader nodes identified by spreadability index are validated by the infection rate as generated by SIS for them. It can be observed from Table 1 to Table 5 that the proposed methodology has the highest SIS infection rate of 2.46 (see Table 1 ) in comparison to others for their corresponding top 10 spreader nodes in the synthetic network as shown in Figure 1 .",

In fact, spreader nodes are successfully identified by the virtue of this scoring technique which covers all the aspects of transmitting infection from one node to another in a PPIN. It should be mentioned here that while identifying spreader nodes in SARS-CoV level 2 human proteins, it has been noted that the number of nodes are getting increased largely with the increment of successive levels. So, high, medium and low threshold [33] have been applied and the entire disease transmission through spreadability index is computationally assessed at each threshold.",
