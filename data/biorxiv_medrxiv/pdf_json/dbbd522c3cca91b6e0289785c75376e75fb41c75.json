We here examine how the presence of purifying and background 12 selection may bias demographic inference by evaluating two commonly-used methods (MSMC 13 and fastsimcoal2), specifically studying how the underlying shape of the distribution of fitness 14 effects (DFE) and the fraction of directly selected sites interacts with demographic parameter 15 estimation. The results demonstrate that, even after masking functional genomic regions, 16 background selection effects may result in the mis-inference of population growth under models 17 of both constant population size as well as decline. This effect is amplified as the strength of 18 purifying selection and the density of directly selected sites increases. We propose a potential 19 solution to correct for this mis-inference. By treating the DFE as a nuisance parameter and 20 averaging across all potential realizations, we demonstrate that even directly selected sites may 21 be used to infer demographic histories with reasonable accuracy. 22 23",

(used with default parameters as provided by the package) was used to correct for the 167 relationship between parameters and statistics. To infer posterior estimates, a tolerance of 0.1 168 was applied (i.e., 10% of the total number of simulations were accepted by ABC to estimate the 169 posterior probability of each parameter). The weighted medians of the posterior estimates for 170 each parameter were used as point estimates. ABC inference was performed under two 171 conditions: (1) complete neutrality, and (2) in the presence of direct purifying selection. In both 172 cases only 2 parameters were inferred -ancestral (Nanc) and current (Ncur) population sizes. 173 However, in scenario 2, the shape of the DFE was also varied. Specifically, the parameters f0, f1, 174 f2, and f3 were treated as nuisance parameters and were sampled such that 0 \u2264 f i \u2264 1, and \u03a3i fi = 1, 175 for i = 0 to 3. In addition, in order to limit the computational complexity involved in the ABC 176 framework, values of fi were restricted to multiples of 0.05 (i.e., fi \u03f5 {0.0, 0.05, 0.10, \u2026, 0.95, 177 1.0} \u2200 i), which allowed us to sample 1,771 different DFE realizations. Simulations were 178 performed with functional genomic regions, and the demographic model was characterized by 1-179 epoch changes in which the population either grows or declines exponentially from ancestral to 180 current size, beginning at a fixed time in the past. For the purpose of illustration, and for 181 comparison with the human-like parameter set above, parameters for ABC testing were selected 182 to resemble those of D. melanogaster African populations.

In order to simulate functional 185 regions, 94 single-exon genes, as described in Johri et al. (2020) Mutation rates were assumed to be fixed at 3 \u00d7 10 -9 per site per generation (Keightley et al. , 190 2014 ). All of these parameters were scaled by the factor 320 in order to decrease computational 191 time. The scaled population sizes thus ranged between ~300-30000 and were reported as scaled 192 values in the main text. One thousand replicate simulations were performed for every parameter 193 combination (Nanc, Ncur, f0, f1, f2, f3), 100 haploid genomes were randomly sampled without 194 replacement, and summary statistics were calculated using pylibseq 0.2.3 (Thornton 2003) . The accuracy and performance of demographic inference was evaluated using two popular 212 methods, MSMC (Schiffels and Durbin 2014) and fastsimcoal2 (Excoffier et al. 2013 ). In order 213 to assess performance, it was first necessary to determine how much genomic information is 214 required to make accurate inference when the assumptions of neutrality are met.

It is made available under a incorrect inferences for all segments smaller than 1 Gb (Supp Figure 1, Supp Figure 2 ). In 218 addition, when 4 or 8 haploid genomes were used for inference, MSMC inferred a recent many-219 fold growth for all segment sizes, but performed well when using 2 genomes for large segments 220 (Supp Figure 1) . These results suggest exercising caution when performing inference on smaller 221 regions or genomes, and when using more than 1 diploid individual in MSMC. All further 222 analyses were restricted to characterizing demographic inference on data that roughly matched 223 the structure and size of the human genome -for every diploid individual, 22 chromosomes of 224 size 150 Mb each were simulated, which amounted to roughly 3 Gb of total sequence. Ten 225 independent replicates of each parameter combination were performed throughout and inference 226 was performed using 1 and 50 diploid individuals for MSMC and fastsimcoal2, respectively. four bins: 0 \u2264 |2Nes| < 1, 1 \u2264 |2Nes| \u2264 10, 10 < |2Nes| \u2264 100 and 100 < |2Nes| \u2264 2Ne. Fitness effects 235 of mutations were uniformly distributed within each bin and the DFE shape was altered by 236 varying the proportion of mutations belonging to each fixed bin, given by f0, f1, f2, and f3, 237 respectively. Three highly skewed DFEs were initially used to assess the impact of the strength 238 of selection on demographic inference (with the remaining mutations equally distributed 239 amongst the other three classes): (1) a DFE in which 70% of mutations have weakly deleterious 240 fitness effects (i.e., f1 = 0.7), (2) a DFE in which 70% of mutations have moderately deleterious 241 fitness effects (i.e., f2 = 0.7), and (3) a DFE in which 70% of mutations have strongly deleterious 242 fitness effects (i.e., f3 = 0.7). In order to understand the effect of BGS, exonic sites were masked, 243 and only linked neutral intergenic sites were used for demographic inference. Three demographic 244 models were examined: (1) demographic equilibrium, (2) a 30-fold exponential growth, 245 mimicking the recent growth experienced by European human populations, and (3) ~6-fold 246 .

We therefore compared models in which genomes contained 5%, 10%, and 20% 281 functional regions. For this comparison, an equal proportion of mutations in each DFE bin were 282 assumed (i.e., f0 = f1 = f2 = f3 = 0.25). As before, when the true model is exponential growth, 283 inference was unbiased, with a slight underestimation of ancestral population size when 20% of 284 the genome is under selection (Figure 3) . When the true model is population decline, it is 285 inferred reasonably well if less than 10% of the genome experiences direct selection, and may be 286 mis-inferred as growth with greater functional density, as shown in Figure 3 . Similarly, the 287 extent to which population size is under-estimated at demographic equilibrium increases with the 288 fraction of the genome under selection. Finally, it is noteworthy that many such changes in 289 population size that were falsely inferred were of a magnitude greater than 2-fold -suggesting 290 the need for great caution when interpreting these plots from empirical data. 291 Importantly, the results presented do not significantly differ between inference performed 292 while including directly selected sites (i.e., no masking of functional regions) versus inference 293 performed using linked neutral sites (i.e., masking functional regions) as shown in Supp Figure  294 4.

These results demonstrate that even if the true DFE of a population is 340 unknown (as will always be the case empirically), it is possible to infer the demographic history 341 with reasonable accuracy by approximately accounting for these selective effects. It is important to note that background selection effects extend to genomic distances in a 359 way that is positively related to the strength of purifying selection. For instance, strongly and 360 moderately deleterious mutations affect patterns of diversity at large genomic distances, whereas 361 mildly deleterious mutations primarily skew allele frequencies at adjacent sites. Thus, if 362 intergenic regions further away from exons are used to perform demographic inference, strongly 363 deleterious mutations are likely to predominantly bias inference. In contrast, if synonymous sites 364 are used to infer demographic history, mildly deleterious mutations will more predominantly 365 influence inference. Thus, as we here focused on relatively sparsely-coding genomes (resembling 366 human-like densities) and used intergenic sites to perform inference, moderately and strongly 367 deleterious mutations resulted in more severe demographic mis-inference. These results suggest 368 that demographic mis-inference will become stronger when such approaches are applied to 369 smaller, and more compact, genomes with higher gene densities. 370 .

However, both methods 372 falsely infer growth under alternative models, which is exacerbated as the density of coding 373 regions increases. The correspondingly inferred times of population growth inferred by both 374 methods appear to be relatively randomly affected. Further, we observed little difference in 375 performance when using all SNPs relative to thinning SNPs to be separated by 5kb (Supp Figure  376 6), presumably because the models investigated do not generate strong LD. Overall, the degree 377 of mis-inference caused by a neglect of BGS is largely similar between the two methods. In sum, we find that the effects of purifying and background selection result in similar 401 demographic mis-inference across approaches, and that masking functional sites does not yield 402 accurate parameter estimates. In order to side-step many of these difficulties, our proposed 403 approach of inferring demography by averaging selection effects across all possible DFE 404 realizations within an ABC framework appears to be highly promising. Utilizing only functional 405 regions, we found a great improvement in accuracy, without making any assumptions regarding 406 the true underlying shape of the DFE or the neutrality of particular classes of sites. As such, this 407 approach represents a more computationally-efficient avenue if only demographic parameters are 408 of interest, and ought to be particularly useful in the great majority of organisms in which 409 unlinked neutral sites either do not exist, or are difficult to identify and verify. Schiffels and Durbin (2014) . The X-axis is in years (assuming a generation time of 30 years). Note that the Y-axes are on different scales, and the magnitude of change observed in the empirical data is considerably larger than that observed in the simulated data. Thus, this comparison is only meant to illustrate this common shape taken in MSMC plots (and see similar shapes in, for example, vervets (Warren et al. 2015 ; Figure 4 ) and passenger pigeons (Hung et al. 2014; Figure 2) ).",

Stronger growth is inferred when the effects of mutations are more deleterious. 254 Conversely, when the true demographic model is characterized by recent 30-fold growth, 255 demographic inference is accurate and performs equally well for both MSMC and fastsimcoal2, 256 with the exception of a slight under-estimation of the ancestral population size for all DFE types. 257 When the true model is population decline, weakly deleterious mutations alone did not affect 258 inference drastically and it was possible to recover the true model. However, moderately and 259 strongly deleterious mutations resulted in an underestimation of population sizes and an 260 inference of strong growth -to the extent that the decline model would be misinterpreted as a 261 growth model. We further tested the effect of BGS on demographic inference when changes in 262 population size were less severe, namely, when population growth and decline was only 2-fold -263 with qualitatively similar results (Supp Figure 3). 264 Finally, given strong evidence that most organisms have a bi-modal DFE with a 265 significant proportion of strongly deleterious or lethal mutations (Sanju\u00e1n 2010; Kousathanas 266 and Keightley 2013; Jacquier et al. 2013; Bank et al. 2014), we investigated the effect of this 267strongly deleterious class further. Thus, for comparison with the above, we simulated a rather 268 extreme case in which 30% or 50% of exonic mutations are strongly deleterious with fitness 269 effects uniformly sampled between 100 \u2264 |2Nancs| \u2264 2Nanc, with the remaining mutations being 270 neutral. Similar to the above results, both equilibrium and decline models were falsely inferred as 271 growth, with an order of magnitude under-estimation of the true population size(Figure 2). 272In sum, the neglect of BGS effects frequently results in the inference of population 273 growth, almost regardless of the true underlying model.",

By utilizing the decay of BGS effects around functional regions, they 311 demonstrated high accuracy under the simple demographic models examined. Moreover, the 312 method makes no assumptions about the neutrality of synonymous sites, and can thus be used to 313 estimate selection acting on these sites, or in non-coding functional elements as well. However, 314 this computationally-intensive approach is specifically concerned with jointly inferring the DFE 315 with demography. As such, if an unbiased characterization of the population history is the sole 316aim, such a procedure may be needlessly involved.

As such, we explored 350 how violations of this assumption may affect demographic inference, particularly with regard to 351 the underlying strength of purifying selection and the genomic density of directly selected sites. 352 Generally speaking, the neglect of these effects (i.e., background selection) results in an 353 inference of population growth, with the severity of the growth model roughly scaling with 354 selection strength and density. Thus, when the true underlying model is in fact growth, 355 demographic mis-inference is not particularly severe; when the true underlying model is of 356 constant size or decline, the mis-inference can be extreme, with a many-fold under-estimation of 357 population size. 358",

The pattern of these erroneous size changes lend a characteristic 381 shape to the MSMC curve (i.e., ancient decline and recent growth) which appears to resemble the382 demographic history previously inferred for the Yoruban population (Schiffels and Durbin 383 2014), including the time at which changes in population size occurred (Supp Figure 5). Previous 384 work has demonstrated that this resulting model does not in fact well-explain the observed site-385 frequency spectrum in the Yoruban population (Lapierre et al. 2017; Beichman et al. 2017). A 386 similar shape has also been inferred in the vervet subspecies (Warren et al. 2015; Figure 4), in 387 passenger pigeons (Hung et al. 2014; Figure 2), in elephants (Palkopoulou et al. 2018; Figure 4), 388 in Arabidopsis (Fulgione et al. 2018; Figure 3), and in grapevines (Zhou et al. 2017; Figure 2A). 389 Although under simulated neutrality the population size fluctuations are only ~1.2-fold, in most 390 empirical applications the fluctuations are of a somewhat larger magnitude (~ 2-fold in pigeons, 391 Arabidopsis, and grapevines). Nonetheless, this neutral, equilibrium performance of MSMC is 392 concerning, and adds to the other previously published cautions related to the interpretation of 393 MSMC results. For example, Mazet et al. (2016) and Chikhi et al. (2018) demonstrated that 394 under constant population size with hidden structure, inference may suggest false size change 395(see also Orozco-terWengel 2016) . In addition, MSMC has been reported to falsely infer growth 396 prior to instantaneous bottlenecks(Bunnefeld et al. 2015). In addition, we observed that if 397 insufficient genomic data is utilized, or more than 2 haploid genomes are used to perform 398 inference, MSMC falsely infers recent growth of varying magnitudes (as previously observed by 399Beichman et al. 2017). 400",
