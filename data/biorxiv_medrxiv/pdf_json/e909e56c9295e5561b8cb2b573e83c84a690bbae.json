We investigate the changes in R0 for COVID-19 on the DP from January 21 to February 19, 2020 with a chainbinomial model at different times under two scenarios: no quarantine assuming a random mixing condition, and quarantine of passengers in cabins -passengers may get infected either by an infectious case in a shared cabin or by asymptomatic crew who continued to work. Our modeling approach takes account of the asymptomatic ratio of crew members during the quarantine of passengers, which has not been explored in the literature. Assuming an asymptomatic ratio 0.505 and the proportion of infections in cabins 0.2, R0 at the beginning of the epidemic was 3.27 (95% CI (3.02, 3.54)) and 3.78 (95% CI (3.49, 4.09)) respectively for serial intervals of 5 and 6 days, and increased for passengers in contact with asymptomatic crew during quarantine. We find evidence to support a CDC report that \"a high proportion of asymptomatic infections could partially explain the high attack rate among cruise ship passengers and crew.\" This emphasizes the importance of improved reporting and quarantine of asymptomatic cases, and raises questions on quarantine procedures in closed environments such as military vessels, cruise ships, dormitories, prisons, and other enclosed living complexes with high population densities.",

The reproductive number (R0) of COVID-19 is a key piece of information for understanding an epidemic. Current intervention methods focus on quarantine methods with either mitigation or suppression strategies aimed at reducing the reproduction number R0 and flattening the curve [2] . Asymptomatic infectious cases are less likely to seek medical care or to be tested and quarantined, contributing to the infectious potential of a respiratory virus [3, 4] . Clinical findings have suggested that the viral load in asymptomatic patients is similar to that in symptomatic patients [5] . Evidence suggests that these asymptomatic patients can infect others before they manifest any symptoms [6, 7, 8] . In an early study of cases in Wuhan [9] , 200 individuals out of 240 (83%) reported no exposure to an individual with respiratory symptoms, which suggests presymptomatic/asymptomatic infection is common [10] . The DP data [11, 12, 13] allow us to further examine the impact of asymptomatic cases in a closed environment. A CDC report [14] states that \"a high proportion of asymptomatic infections could partially explain the high attack rate among cruise ship passengers and crew.\"",

This passenger became symptomatic on January 23 and disembarked on January 25 in Hong Kong. On February 1, six days after leaving the ship, he tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 at a Hong Kong hospital. Japanese authorities were informed about this test result. On February 4, the authorities announced positive test results for SARS-CoV-2 for another ten people on board. The ship was quarantined by the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare for what was expected to be a 14-day period, off the Port of Yokohama [11] . Initially, passengers were quarantined in their cabins while the crew continued to work. Only symptomatic cases and close contacts were tested for COVID-19 and PCR-confirmed positive passengers were removed and isolated in Japanese hospitals. As reported [12] , attempts were made to test all passengers including asymptomatic cases starting on February 11, and as of February 20, 619 cases had been confirmed (16.7 % of the population on board), including 82 crew and 537 passengers. Overall, 712 (19.2%) of the crew and passengers tested positive [14] . Since 50.5% of the COVID-19 cases on the DP were asymptomatic [12] , this situation is very close to a real-life scenario that would be found in urban areas.",

Other researchers using data on the DP up to February 16 have estimated the median R0 as 2.28 [16] .

(d) For t = 4 and t = 5 during the quarantine of passengers, Nt = Nt-1 -It, and we further make the following assumptions. (i) Of all infected cases, 86.8% were passengers and 13.2% crew [11] . We use these proportions to calculate the number of infected persons in each group, Ipt and Ict, respectively, and It = Ipt + Ict. This assumption is imposed since there is no public data available for the time course of Ipt and Ict. (ii) Crew members continued to work unless showing symptoms; hence the binomial transmission probability of Ict remained the same as 1 -exp(-\u03b2 \u00d7 It-1/Nt-1), t = 4 and 5. In other words, crew were randomly mixing in the population on board. (iii) Passengers stayed in cabins most of the time. Assume that among infected passengers Ipt, the proportion of infections that occurred in cabins is rp, and that the average occupancy per cabin is 2. For those Ipt-1 cases, t = 4, 5, the binomial transmission probability to infect Ipt \u00d7 rp passengers is 1 -exp(-\u03b2/2). Based on [11] , rp = 0.2 (= 23/115), while we assume rp = 0.2 and 0.3 when \u03c4 = 6. For this assumption, rp \u2264 Ipt-1/Ipt, and thus rp cannot be made arbitrarily large. (iv) The other (1 -rp) proportion of infected passengers' cases was possibly due to asymptomatic crew members who continued to perform service [11] , and their binomial transmission probability is assumed to be pt = 1 -exp(-\u03b2 \u00d7 aratio \u00d7 Ict-1/Ct-1), where aratio is the asymptomatic ratio and Ct-1 is the number of crew members on board at time t -1. That is to say, these passengers were randomly mixing in the crew population with possible infectious contact with asymptomatic crew. In our calculations, aratio = 0.4, 0.465 [14] , 0.505 [12] , 0.6, and 0.7.",

R0 for passengers in (d)(iv) is 4.73 (95% CI (4.37, 5.12)) and 4.39 (95%CI (4.06, 4.75)) at t = 4, 5, respectively, and 1.06 (95%CI (0.98, 1.15)) and 1.05 (95%CI (0.97, 1.14)) for crew in (d)(ii) respectively.

From t = 4 to t = 5, R0 for those passengers decreased slightly to 4.39, mostly due to removal of a larger number of infected passengers.

The report of this intervention considers that quarantine of asymptomatic positives contributed to control of the infection [26] . In contrast, a number of other cruise ships and some military vessels, which were not able to perform immediate ship-wide screening, suffered rapid spread of COVID-19 similar to what occurred on the DP.

First, due to inadequate data on the time course of infection cases among crew and passengers, assumption (d)(i) assumes a constant proportion, which may vary with time in practice. Second, the values of the parameter rp assumed in the present study may not be sufficiently large. Third, the investigation on asymptomatic COVID-19 cases is ongoing and it is unknown whether the values of the asymptomatic ratio used in this paper are close to the truth. Finally, the assumptions (a)-(d) under chain-binomial models may not be sufficient to capture the complexity of the COVID-19 epidemics. Fuller data reporting is important for researchers to develop statistical methodology to help combat this pandemic.",
