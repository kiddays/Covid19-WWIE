Td10 and Td20 were \u22653 days longer in tropical/subtropical vs. temperate areas (2.8\u00b11.2 vs. 5.7\u00b13.4; p=1.41E-05 and 4.6\u00b11.8 vs. 8.6\u00b14.2; p=9.7E-05, respectively). The factors involved in Td10 (DFC and \u0394DD) were different than those in Td20 (Td10 and climate areas). After D100, the fastest growth-curves during the first 10 days, were associated with Td10<2 and Td10<3 in temperate and tropical/subtropical countries, respectively. The fold change Td20/Td10 >2 was associated with earlier flattening of the growth-curve. In multivariate models, Td10, DFC and ambient temperature were negatively related with CF and explained 44.7% (r 2 = 0.447) of CF variability at day 20 of the growth-curve, while Td20 and DFC were negatively related with CF and explained 63.8% (r 2 = 0.638) of CF variability towards day 30 of the growth-curve. Conclusions. The larger Td in tropical/subtropical countries is positively related to DFC and temperature. Td and environmental factors explain 64% of CF variability in the best of cases. Therefore, other factors, such as pandemic containment measures, would explain the remaining variability.",

However, this only comprised 0.01% of its total population, and Canada had a 0.04% infectious rate. The data from these North American countries, were low, but still 10 times more frequent than in the rest of the countries of Central and South America, with rates ranging from 0.04% in Panama, 0.001% in Mexico, 0.002% in Colombia and 0.0003% in Guatemala. 6 The above described infectious rates, decreasing from Europe to North America and South America, is in agreement with the time frame of the spreading path that this pandemic has followed. 5 However, the much lower infection rates in South America, compared to the USA and Canada as well as that in Europe, may also reflect an underestimation on the illness, although other variables including climatologic differences deserve to be studied. First, the cold winter season and severe drought were both present in China during the first SARS 2002 and the current COVID-19 epidemics. 4 Second, the combination of cold and dry environment seem to be more adequate than cold weather by itself for viral transmission. 7 Even more, cold temperature and lower humidity reduce both ciliary movement and the mucous secretion as defensive mechanism to remove particles such as infectious agents, and alters the integrity of the nose-mucosal epithelium. Overall, cold and dry environment may enhance the susceptibility to COVID-19 infections. 4, 8 All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission.",

And in more southern countries such as Argentina, it is autumn with template weather. Thus, it is plausible that the higher temperatures and humidity in these countries, explain the much lower infectious rates of COVID-19 when compared to the Northern hemisphere. 9 Also, viral infections have cyclic patterns such as the annual flu or the human respiratory syncytial virus epidemic in which hosts are more susceptible during the winter months. 10 However, not all viruses have the same seasonality, and some spread during the summer season (e.g. Enteroviruses), other have a spring/fall cycle (e.g. Rhinovirus), or all year round (e.g. Adenovirus). 11 Also, transmission can occur in different weather patterns. 12, 13 which is especially true for tropical regions in which there is no clear seasonal pattern. 14 When a new virus such as the SARS CoV2 arise with no immunity for humans, and with a great capacity to disseminate, the seasonality might or might not be a determinant factor for its spread. 15 Therefore we aimed at analyzing the role of climate areas, outside temperature, humidity, the number of days it took for the spreading curve to raise or elevate (DCS) and to reach the first 100 cases (D100) and the difference of the latter ones (\u0394DD) All rights reserved.

An indirect way to evaluate the slope, is to measure the number of days it takes for the curve to reach 100 cases, once the ascend begins.

In fact, the Td20 falls below 2, and as seen in Figure 4 , the slope of the curve increases from day 7 and the curve ascends almost as a straight line between Td= 2 and Td= 3.

The fastest growth curves during the first 10 days, after D100 day, were associated with Td10 <2 and Td10< 3 in temperate and tropical/subtropical countries, respectively.

The question is why in these countries the cumulated positive cases curve rose rapidly but with a smaller slope than in countries of temperate zones, and why in the later ones, once the rise of the curve began, the slope was steeper. In discussing the last issue first, an important possibility could be that in European and other temperate countries, asymptomatic individuals were the first to accumulate and these subjects spread the infection. 19 This seems very feasible as up to 80% of infected individuals are asymptomatic. 20, 21 22, 23 In addition, common use of mass transportation and small housing spaces in European cities or those such as New York with a high population density, could have facilitated infection dissemination. Further, the spread could have then affected the older population which in temperate countries make up a much higher percentage of the population pyramid than in countries of tropical/subtropical areas.

While the information gathered herein provides further support to the notion that an overall increased temperature and humidity limits the spreading and occurrence of Covid-19, systematic studies are required to ruled out possible ethnical and/or genetical influences 35 upon the spreading of and susceptibility to the disease. In this regard, as mentioned earlier, the human ACE2 receptor has now been recognized as the receptor for the SARS-CoV-2 S protein, and variations in this gene may confer susceptibility or some type of resistance to the viral infection. 36 Allelic variants may differ according to countries or populations and explain, at least partially, differences in infection rates. On the other hand, the differences in the rise of the curve, the \u0394DD and the Td10 were not uniform among the countries within temperate or tropical/subtropical areas. For example, in European countries such as Switzerland, Austria, Holland, Norway and the Czech Republic, these parameters were similar to those observed in tropical/subtropical areas and not to those in the rest of Europe. This finding coincides with the diagnosis of Covid-19 later than in the rest of Europe (Figure 3 panel A).

If this would have been the case, we would have observed a greater difference between the comparisons of partial doubling times between the climate zone as the curve progresses, that is, that there would have been a greater difference (\u0394) in \u0394Td30 >\u0394Td20 > \u0394Td10. We were not able to compare the Td30 as the curve in most of the countries in tropical/subtropical areas have not reached that period yet, but we found that \u0394Td20>\u0394Td10. Although, in the lineal regression models, Td10 participated in the value of Td20, only explaining about 17% of the variability of that value. Therefore, the expected difference in the Td20s between countries within temperate and tropical/subtropical zones should not be greater than 1.17 times Td10, and in opposition to that, the difference of the Td20s was 2.6 times that of Td10. This suggests that the differences in Td20 between countries in the different climate areas, may be related to factors such as the number of tests performed and the implemented measures to mitigate the epidemic. However, the relationship or change folds between Td20 and Td10 must remain valid, on the assumption, at least in principle, that the policies on the number of tests and implemented containment measures, did not change too much in each country. In addition, no statistically significant difference was found between FCTd20/Td10 in countries within temperate or tropical/subtropical regions. This implies that the value of FCTd20/Td10 \u2265 2 would be a good parameter for both regions to positively assess the evolution of the epidemic during the 21-30 day-periods of the curves.",

These two issues allowed the comparison of several variables in various segments of the epidemic growth curve and to establish the differences between the two climatic zones. Notwithstanding, the study has some limitations such as the inability to incorporate in the analysis the number of tests carried out or the containment measures implemented in each country, during the different periods of the epidemic curves.

The Td10 is on average 3 days longer in tropical/subtropical countries than in those located in temperate zones and can predict the growth of the curve for the following 10 days of the evolution of the epidemic after D100. These differences appear to be related to ambient temperature and the date of the first case that was identified and how the infection spread in both climatic zones.

The Td20 performed better than the TdT, so it was this variable that was introduced in the MLR model. In fact, Td20 alone explains 36.5% of the CF's variability at the 30th day of the growth curve. This indicates that the speed of the growth curve during the previous 10 days (days 11 to 20), is essential for controlling the CF during the following 10-day period of the outbreak evolution, that is, from 21 to 30 days after the day D100. Since none of the other factors analyzed with the ULR models passed the cut-off value, in addition to Td20, the date of the first case and the average temperature were introduced into the MLR analysis since the p-values are just above 0.2. In the MLR analysis, only Td20 and the date of the first case remained in the model, which explained 63.8% (r 2 = 0.638) of the variability of the frequency of accumulated infected cases towards the 30th day of the curve. Similarly, both factors have a negative influence on the CF. The rest of the variability (36%) must be related to other factors, such as the containment measures used by each country to control the epidemic.All rights reserved.

For example, factors such as cohabitation in small spaces with poor ventilation 10 may interact with a decreased immune response associated with aging, and diminished airway function,[24][25][26][27] further predisposing to viral infections. This would explain the late rise with a steeper slope in the epidemic curve in those countries. In contrast, in tropical/subtropical countries the early ascent, with a slower slope of the curve, could be related to the initial presence of imported cases, mainly from European countries and the US, and the dissemination to their contacts. We have hypothesized that these imported cases, mainly of middle or highersocioeconomic groups who have the possibility of traveling both for leisure and work, could have later spread the infection on a smaller scale, mainly because they do not use mass public transportation. On the other hand, in the population pyramid in those countries there is a large proportion of young people, which could have contributed to a lower frequency rate, due to a silent outbreak or an infection with less severe clinical manifestations. For example, the median age of confirmed cases with Covid-19 is much lower in Mexico, according to the daily data reported by the Secretary of",
