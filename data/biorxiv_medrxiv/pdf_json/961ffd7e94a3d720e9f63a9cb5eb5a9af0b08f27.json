Mutations in the viral genome have critical impacts on the adaptation of viral strains to the local environment, and may alter the characteristics of viral transmission, disease manifestation, and the efficacy of treatment and vaccination. Using the complete sequences of 1,932 SARS-CoV-2 genomes, we examined the genomic, geographic and temporal distributions of aged, new, and frequent mutations of SARS-CoV-2, and identified six phylogenetic clusters of the strains, which also exhibit a geographic preference in different continents. Mutations in the form of single nucleotide variations (SNVs) provide a direct interpretation for the six phylogenetic clusters. Linkage disequilibrium, haplotype structure, evolutionary process, global distribution of mutations unveiled a sketch of the mutational history. Additionally, we found a positive correlation between the average mutation count and case fatality, and this correlation had strengthened with time, suggesting an important role of SNVs on disease outcomes. This study suggests that SNVs may become an important consideration in virus detection, clinical treatment, drug design, and vaccine development to avoid target shifting, and that continued isolation and sequencing is a crucial component in the fight against this pandemic.",

In this study, we discovered that the genome of SARS-CoV-2 is changing rapidly from the originally isolated form. These mutations have been spreading around the world and caused more than 2.5 million of infected cases and 170 thousands of deaths. We found that fourteen frequent mutations identified in this study can characterize the six main clusters of SARS-CoV-2 strains. In addition, we found the mutation burden is positively correlated with the fatality of COVID-19 patients. Understanding mutations in the SARS-CoV-2 genome will provide useful insight for the design of treatment and vaccination.",

This virus is a positive strand RNA virus with a genomic length of about 30K (29,903 nucleotides in the reference genome), and is evolving rapidly.

This phenomenon partially reflects the early occurrence of epidemic of COVID-19 in Asia. Among the nations having at least 10 cases reported in this dataset, the top three nations with the highest average mutation counts were all located in Europe: Spain, Belgium, and Finland. The three nations with the lowest value were located in Asia: Singapore, Japan, and China. The six major clusters derived from the phylogenetic analysis (Figure 1 ) also showed more mutations in the European and American clusters compared to the two Asian clusters.

In addition to the cumulated aged mutations, we also identified a significant number of new mutations occurring at each date. Unlike the increasing trend of the cumulated aged mutations, the number of new mutations occurring globally at each date remained at a constant level.

First, the mutations have a similar mutation rate if they were first observed at the same or close dates and in strong LD. For example, nt8782 (C to T) and nt28144 (T to C) that were used to define L type and S type of SARS-CoV-2 (2) first co-appeared on Jan 5th 2020 and the coefficient of LD is R2 = 0.983 ( Figure 3A) . The reference strain used here is the L type, while the S type exhibits both mutations. This implies that the frequent mutations on the same haplotype were co-transmitted to the infected cases during infection. The haplotypes were located in the same or across different gene regions. Other cases first co-observed at the same date included nt1059 (C to T) and nt25563 (G to T) (Feb 21st 2020); nt28881 (G to A), nt28882 (G to A), and nt28883 (G to C) (Feb 25th 2020). Nucleotides nt3037 (C to T), nt14408 (C to T), and nt23403 (A to G) having high pairwise LD are the most frequent nucleotides in the current data set. Nucleotides nt17747 (C to T), nt17858 (A to G), and nt18060 (C to T) having almost identical nucleotide frequency also showed high pairwise LD.

Additionally, the Americas group also carried mutations nt17747T (ORF1ab), nt17858G (ORF1ab), and nt18060T (ORF1ab). The Asia-2 group is distinct from others because the strains in this group did not carry most of the frequent mutations. On average, the dates of sample collection of the two Asian groups were closest to the first emergence of COVID-19 in December 2019 and their genomes were closest to the reference. They were characterized by multiple mutations with low frequencies. Only about 6% of viral strains cannot be categorized into the six main phylogenetic clusters.",

Surprisingly, by April 21, 2020 the correlation between case fatality and the average mutation count has become even more significant with p= 0.0348 (Figure 4C) , and its contribution from ORF1ab has a p value of 0.0291 ( Figure 4D ).

These subgroups can be characterized by 14 common mutations, most of which occurred in ORF1ab, with notable exceptions in S, N, ORF3a and ORF8. This result suggests the importance of these genes in viral fitness and perhaps clinical relevance. Unexpectedly, we found that the case fatality rate in each country correlates positively with the average mutation count per sample. The positive correlation was contributed mainly from gene region ORF1ab, which codes for polyproteins that are cleaved to become proteases, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, helicase, and several nonstructural proteins (nsp). The significance of the correlation increased with time, suggesting that mutation may have impacted viral transmission, clinical manifestation, or treatment outcomes.",

We dissected the prevalent mutations, investigated their LD structure, traced their evolutionary path, and found their importance in the characterization of phylogenetic clusters. Interestingly, many frequent mutations occurred simultaneously, with LD close to 1. These mutations may occur simultaneously because of strong positive interactions. Alternatively, they might occur sequentially but appeared simultaneously due to insufficient sampling. The biological implication of each mutation and their interactions remain an interesting topic to be explored. As aged mutations continued to accumulate in time and expand globally, new mutations emerged in the gene pool constantly to enrich the diversity of mutations. Since the fatality rate appears to correlate with the mutation count, the continued isolation and sequencing of the viral genome to monitor mutations become a crucially important component in the fight against this pandemic.",

Generalized association plot (GAP) (5) was used to visualize the mutation patterns and identify the outliers in variations and samples ( Figure S2 ).
