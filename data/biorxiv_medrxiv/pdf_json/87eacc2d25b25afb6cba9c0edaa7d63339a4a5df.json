According to early surveillance, Huanan seafood market was the originating place and thereafter human-to-human transmission has escalated in an exponential pace. As per RNA-sequence analysis, the novel coronavirus may be arisen from cross-species transmission between bats and snakes (Ji et al., 2020) . Three variants of the virus were identified in a phylogenetic network analysis that used bat virus as an outgroup (Forstera et al., 2020) . Two of them are common in Europeans and Americans, while the other one is common in East Asia, showing the vulnerability in genetic changes. Li et al. (2020a) as per their analysis of early dynamics, reported that the basic reproductive number R 0 of COVID-19 in China was 2.2 and incubation period 5.2 days. In another early estimation, Zhao et al. (2020) reported that R 0 ranges from 2.24 to 3.58. Amidst those varying estimations, transmission risk of COVID-19 is noteworthy as compared to previous two outbreaks SARS in 2003 and MERS in 2012 since individuals can be infectious before being symptomatic (Huang et al., 2020; Hellewell et al., 2020) .",

Countrywise variations can be observed in motivation, compliance, and success toward effective control strategies (United Nations, 2020) . There is notable difference in hospitalization, for instance China practiced it as an isolation procedure as well, while USA and UK recommended it only for severe cases (Verity et al., 2020) .

Countries are given a more detailed classification, indicating lower to higher risk as interrupted transmission, under investigation, imported cases only, local transmission and community transmission. However, it should be scaled down to workplace and household level. Then compartmental aspect of how many are susceptible, symptomatic, asymptomatic, recovered, etc. will decide the immediate risk to the community (Chan et al., 2020) . Both susceptibil-ity and fatality risks have age dependency, where older group shows higher vulnerability Zhou et al., 2020) . In addition, sneezing, touching contaminated surfaces, individual immunity, number of members sharing the space necessarily come into effect. To be more successful, all preventive measures should be communicated in a practically sounding way, irrespective of the socio-economic background of community or country. Under dreadful circumstances, we should focus on what are expected from each individual to mitigate further risk of In this work, we are concerned with a certain rule of thumb that can be applied on individual level. Two measures are put under investigation: minimum contact radius during physical distancing and the number of cross-household encounters. The first measure has been appearing in the media from various countries, steering the possibility of getting infection via direct transmission (i.e. by sneezing). The second measure represents how many encounters with infected persons per day a susceptible person makes on average. This number is unobservable, yet is known to drive the force of infection in standard epidemic models, therefore also subject to treatment. After model derivation and data fitting, our final plan will be to compare the performance of extending the minimum contact radius and reducing the number of cross-household encounters from the model solution in terms of minimizing the number of predicted active cases. Our model bases its design on a standard SIR-type model with additional features highlighting minimum contact radius, direct and fomite transmission, also different household structures incorporating district-specific attributes. Via the latter we can be more specific on selecting transmission routines within and between households. Many factors are infused into a basic model through parameters in the form of rates, probabilities, and ratios, as seen shortly.",

The population is subdivided into several compartments based on the infection status and severity. The first compartment is susceptible S , determining a group of humans who are free from the virus but vulnerable to infections. An S -individual can have a first contact to the virus and it takes a few days from such an onset until symptoms appear, called incubation period \u03b8 \u22121 [d], during which the person belongs to the exposed compartment E. As COVID-19 also contracts asymptomatic cases (Rothe et al., 2020) , at the termination of the incubation period, the person can still be asymptomatic A or symptomatic I depending on the immune response (fitness), age, and possible co-morbidities (Huang et al., 2020) . We assume that the asymptomatic cases share the proportion of a to the exposed cases. An asymptomatic case goes further to either of the two cases: detected pA or undetected (1 \u2212 p)A. Determination of the average probability measure p is heavily contingent on whether the person initiates a self-report to the medical department or not. Having been designated infection-positive, the asymptomatic person initiates self-quarantine at a certain rate. When the person undergoes a symptomatic infection, we assume that (s)he is automatically directed to a hospital. At this stage, all humans occupying pA and I are reported in the media as active cases. The moment when the infection ends, all the corresponding active cases become closed cases in which infection-free humans either recover or die, who are then compiled into R and I compartment, respectively.",

The time scale (unit) is assumed to be 1 day [d] . The window of observation is considered short enough that the resultant of births and natural deaths is ignorable. Focusing on certain countries, we seek to simulate our model starting after global travel restriction, where migrations and imports in the population are negligible. Therefore, the total human population is considered constant. We assume that all the undetected individuals (1 \u2212 p)A are free to move around like the susceptible humans, while those who undergo quarantine among pA are not. All the I-individuals clearly stay in hospitals. Infection happens when a susceptible person unrelated to medical department encounters an A-individual. A susceptible medical staff can also get infected through contact with an I-individual. Suppose that all the A-and I-individuals express certain sneezing behavior during infection with a uniform sneezing rate s [d \u22121 ]. This number determines how often they sneeze per day on average. Other important parameters for the successful virus transmission are an effectivity measure e s , determining how probable a sneeze (water droplets) leading to a successful infection, and a probability measure p s determining how probable an infected person sneezes during contact with a susceptible person. Another parameter leading to successful infection is related to how proximate a susceptible and an infected person during contact are. We define a decreasing function \u03c6(r) of the minimum contact radius r [m] describing how essential certain contact radii leading to the transfer of water droplets from an infected to a susceptible person. Moreover, we note that A/N determines the probability of a susceptible person to meet with an infected person from A, equalling to the number of A-individuals divided by the total population. The frequency multiplied by the probability, S \u00b7 A/N, determines the 'expected' number of encounters that would probably lead to infection. This number, however, assumes that every S -individual encounters an A-individual only at maximum one time per day. If k denotes the average number of encounters with A-individuals experienced by any S -individual, then k \u00b7 S \u00b7 A/N denotes the average number of encounters that possibly cause infection. This seemingly large k (can also be greater than N/A) is neutralized by p s , and essentially the remaining parameters mentioned earlier, such that not all S -individuals experience infection per day. Therefore, attributed to direct transmission is the loss of individuals from the susceptible compartment S of daily magnitude \u03b2(r) \u00b7 S \u00b7 (A + p I I),",

We assume there are H households occupying the observed region \u2126. It is straightforward to see that N = N h H.

For brevity, we denote S := i S i , which also applies for the other state variables. We assume that close interactions within households define a larger number of encounters k wh (wh stands for within-household) such that k wh > k ch (ch for cross-household). Consequently, the within-household \u03b2 h and cross-household infection rate \u03b2 hold the relation \u03b2 h > \u03b2 for all minimum contact radii r.

We then assume by (2.5) that the number of encounters per day doubles as now N h = 2 individuals are present, triples as N h = 3, and so on. An important remark is that this approximation may underestimate the real pictures as asymptomatic persons might still behave as if no infection occurs and if indeed so, the other members might take care of them incautiously.

Country Y has more dynamic citizens of the same cross-household encounters k ch (facilitated by adequate transportation system) as that of country X, also small families (small N h ), work in more distant locations from home. The larger spatial coverage induces a large H C . In comparison, country X has a larger population as compared to country Y such that the same k ch has to be acquired by country X and country Y with \"less\" and \"much\" effort, respectively. Our model (2.10) hypothesizes that country X poses higher risk of accelerated infection propagation due to its packed-type household structure and less dynamics as compared to country Y. The risk can also be understood in a different way. We can impose the same number of local households H C but different H's. In this setting, country X produces a larger k ch than what country Y does. Prominent examples could be Sri Lanka-Germany or China-Finland. Looking at the same neighborhood of e.g. H C = 100 households in those countries in comparison would justify the intuition on having different k ch 's.",

A blunt connection to our modeling study is the fact that CFR dissevers the proportions of recovered and dead humans after average illness periods \u03b3 \u22121 A [d] for A-individuals and \u03b3 \u22121 I [d] for I-individuals. The actual CFR is to be calculated when the entire course of epidemics is completed, leaving out only closed cases (deaths and recoveries). Then, the value takes the ratio between total deaths and closed cases (Ghani et al., 2005) . If the disease is still ongoing, computation of CFR becomes tricky. The widely-used estimate for its simplicity is called na\u00efve estimator, calculated based on the ratio between accumulated deaths and confirmed cases over the entire history up to the current time. This ratio is biased and misleading, given that the outcome of part of the denominator is unknown, making the denominator grows much faster than the numerator (Angelopoulos et al., 2020) . This fallacy has invited (statistical) researchers to come up with alternatives in the modification of the numerator and denominator, one claims advantages against the others. Speculations are based on whether concentrating on active cases and/or just closed cases (Ghani et al., 2005; Angelopoulos et al., 2020) , age-dependence (Verity et al., 2020) , time delay in between the real incidences and report (Baud et al., 2020) , and different countrywise treatments in recording incidences (Johns Hopkins University, 2020b).",

Unlike usual CFR measures that relate to accumulated masses, this \u00b5(t) corresponds to the division into deaths and recoveries only at the given time. These daily data can be found from the difference of the closed cases at the present and those at the previous time. If both accumulated deaths and recoveries do not advance after a day before, then we assign \u00b5 = 0 on that day.

Curfew, lockdown, workplace clearance, and school closure are colloquial terms that converge to the same aim: avoiding mass gathering. Only then every term is uniquely determined by certain types of action. For example, lockdown is always associated with restricting people's movement (avoiding going out from home), transportations, and business operations. In this study, we model these actions as to reduce the average number of cross-household encounters k ch . Added with law enforcement, we assume that people react in an impulsive way following the government's order as per the commencement of either of those actions. The actions remain in effect unless they are closed by the government. We can then model \u03b2 as a piecewise constant function over time, for a given minimum contact radius r. The constancy remains when there is no new action introduced in the population. Additionally, attention must be paid to the fact that the effect of a certain action can only be seen from incidence data given some time delay for people to get admitted to hospitals (such that they can be recorded) and for the recorded data to appear in the media. Such time delays can be fixed according to the incubation period.",

Therefore, the formula cannot afford its use on which the disease already advances through returning more deaths and intervention measures are overwhelming. Nonetheless, this early estimation is important for the understanding of the disease progression without any way of obstruction. How this value changes thus relies on the magnitude and tenacity of intervention measures taken in the next step. Second, the role of household structure is now more apparent. Two countries of the same choice of the number of local households H C were predicted to exhibit different numbers of cross-household encounters k ch . When both high-risk and low-risk country are similar in other parameters except k ch and N h -which is almost the usual case -the values of \u03b2N from both countries should be significantly different: the high-risk country takes a larger value than the low-risk country.

We took 5 days for such a delay, which is approximately the incubation period. Therefore, we divide the time domain into four phases for Germany and three phases for Sri Lanka, each of which represents a subdomain where a certain action remains in effect, before added by another one. The fitting results for Germany and Sri Lanka can be seen in Figs. 5.1 and 5.4, respectively. Notwithstanding different numerical values yielded on every phase, our results support the hypothesis that \u03b2 Sri Lanka > \u03b2 Germany for all the overlapping time. The role of fomite transmission, which is steered by \u03b1, is much pronounced in Germany especially on earlier phases as compared to Sri Lanka. Our results allow us to argue that Germans could get infected through the comparable roles of direct and fomite transmission, whereas Sri Lankans are more overwhelmed by direct transmission through sneezing. The proportion of detected cases p for Germany (0.7976) is generally higher than that for Sri Lanka (0.5549). The correction factor related to the virus transmission from patients into medical staffs p I generally starts from a small value during the earlier take-off period (0.0276 for Germany, 0.0048 for Sri Lanka). A hypothetical reason is due to a limited number of COVID-19 patients. Then, it waves to a significantly larger value (almost 1) and decreases thereafter. This means that, the within-hospital transmission entails almost no difference than the usual susceptible-asymptomatic transmission outside of hospitals in the recent phases. The mean values (0.3578 for Germany, 0.5790 for Sri Lanka) lead to the hypothesis that Sri Lankan medical staffs pose higher risk of getting infected in hospitals. A possible reason may be related to the reported irresponsible behavior of several COVID-19 patients who have been admitted to the hospitals without providing real information about their symptoms, historical whereabouts, and close connections to COVID-19 exposed individuals and even hiding from the health officials in backtracking (Arachchi, 2020a; Kariyawasam, 2020; Arachchi, 2020b) . Moreover, the proportion of asymptomatic cases a is generally high for both countries (0.9778 for Germany, 0.9091 for Sri Lanka). This number weighs the exposed humans to be assigned to either the asymptomatic A or symptomatic I compartment in the optimal way such that the active cases pA + I match with data. This process is done without scrutinizing what happen to the A and I compartment individually. This modeling study owes correction to the value of a due to the unavailability of the hospitalized data for I with exact timing of admission and discharge. In case of presence, the objective function should be adjusted by including the hospitalized terms, and a should account for the tradeoff between active and hospitalized cases. Moreover, the findings on recovery rates lead to the hypothesis that the asymptomatic Germans suffer from illness for 5.14d on average, while the symptomatic ones for 18.94d. The asymptomatic and symptomatic Sri Lankans suffer from illness for 5.28d and 14.97d, respectively. Finally, the values of R 0 were computed only on the earlier take-off period. As mentioned in Sec. 3, the different household structures in Germany and Sri Lanka were shown to influence R 0 significantly. Our numerical results confirm this. Moreover, it should be noted that our R 0 was based on aggregating two proportions of new infection cases in the susceptible compartment from an undetected/non-quarantined Aindividual and an I-individual, each per the corresponding illness period. Therefore, such a definition is not to be compared with the conventional geometric multiplier on the occurrence of infection cases per day attributed to a single infected person in a \"virgin\" population. For some more references on studies re- lated to COVID-19's R 0 , see Zhao et al., 2020; Adamik et al., 2020) . We shall also note that R 0 's value is both model-and data-sensitive.

We introduce a ratio R := k new ch /k old ch = \u03b2 new /\u03b2 old \u2208 [0, 1] where \u03b2 old = \u03b2 Phase 4 for Germany and \u03b2 old = \u03b2 Phase 3 for Sri Lanka, also R = 1 directs not to impose any reduction on \u03b2 old . As k ch denotes the 'average' number of cross-household encounters leading to possible infection, R can determine reduction on the intensity of all individual activities. For example, R = 1/ 2 means that every household member who goes for shopping twice a week must reduce to once a week, goes to office work six days per week must reduce to three days, does sport/outdoor exercise four times a week should change to twice a week, gets out from home twice a day changes to once a day, and so on.",

Our model hypothetically suggests that the minimum contact radius of 1.5m in Germany and 1m in Sri Lanka can still be improved to 3m and 4.5m, respectively, in order to gain significant reduction in the number of active cases. We understood that even though \u03b2 can be reduced to zero by means of a lockdown, the residues in the portions of exposed and asymptomatic as well as symptomatic compartment eliminate exponentially but hardly jump to zero in an impulsive manner. This is why we can only afford reduction to the least of 95.59% for Germany and 78.90% for Sri Lanka. In Germany, increasing the minimum contact radius to 3m is equivalent in the outcome of predicted active cases to giving the intensity reduction ratio 1/4. This means that, every person who cannot take up 3m minimum contact radius can reduce his/her intensity of daily/weekly activities to 1/4 or vice versa. In Sri Lanka, predictions of the active cases in the next 10d and 30d give significantly different outcomes. For a short term (10d), extending the minimum contact radius to 4.5m gives more significant reduction (by 78.90%) as compared to giving the intensity reduction ratio 1/4 (93%). For a longer term (30d), both actions are equivalent in terms of the outcomes.",

It caters linking infected status in more realistic way before compromising into macro-level. For instance, sneezing and surface touching are treated in a detailed manner. Meanwhile, we design the infection rate \u03b2 in a unique way by amalgamating many factors relevant to direct transmission through sneezing. Manipulation of a decreasing function \u03b2 of the minimum contact radius r bridges the scientific argument in propounding the physical distancing. Additionally, several notable factors are taken in modeling fomite transmission through surface touching. We enumerate the final effect of these as an accumulation over a period \u03c3d in the past that asymptomatic individuals walked around and freely sneezed. Moreover, with the aim of tolerating differences to and fro households, we introduce the effect of different household structures into the model involving the number of local households and the average number of household members. This leads to easier identification of low-risk and high-risk country in terms of the basic reproductive number on an earlier take-off period.",

Unobservable effects that may represent reality, related to the optimal numerical values, have been hypothesized. The rule of thumb which we propose from our findings is that, considering long-term predictions over the active cases, Germany and Sri Lanka can ameliorate the endemicity level by increasing 1.5m to 3m and 1m to 4.5m minimum contact radius, respectively, and reducing the intensity of individual activities to 1/ 4 by any means of mass control. The latter should be the aspect the governments know better how to put into realization. Both measures can also be applied in combination flexibly, in the sense that those who cannot stick to one can apply the other. For some alternating choices between actions and outcomes, reduced magnitudes of the intensity of individual activities to 1/ 3, 1/2, 3/4 are also presented. Besides these choices, translating other intervention measures such as wearing mask in more secure way into equal reduction on \u03b2 without having to stay away from friends/colleagues and minimize outdoor activities could be a possible outlook. Intensive cleaning of surfaces is also an additional intervention to mitigate fomite transmission.",
