The uncertainty, however, is high, as the lower bound of the 95% prediction interval suggests on average twice as many infections than confirmed cases, and the upper bound 10 times as many. Country-specific variation is high. For Italy, our estimates suggest that the total number of infected is approximately 1 million, or almost 6 times the number of confirmed cases. For the U.S., our estimate of 1.4 million is close to being twice as large as the number of confirmed cases, and the upper bound of 3 million is more than 4 times the number of confirmed cases. For Germany, where testing has been comparatively extensive, we estimate that the total number of infected is only 1.2 times (upper bound: 3 times) than the number of confirmed cases. Comparing our results with findings from local seroprevalence studies and applying our bias formulas shows that some of their infection estimates would only be possible if just a small fraction of COVID-19 related deaths were recorded, indicating that these seroprevalence estimates might not be representative for the total population.",

Our results imply that the total number COVID-19 cases may be approximately 4 times (95%: 2 to 10 times) that of the confirmed cases. Although these estimates are uncertain and vary across countries, they indicate that the COVID-19 pandemic is much more broadly spread than what confirmed cases would suggest, and the number of asymptomatic cases or cases with mild symptoms may be high. In cases in which estimates from local seroprevalence studies or from simulation models exist, our approach can provide a simple benchmark to assess the quality of those estimates.",

This indirect estimation approach can be applied in many contexts as it requires only little input data: the number of COVID-19 related deaths for a population of interest; and scaled age-specific infection fatality rates (IFR; deaths over infections) from a reference population. The IFRs are scaled based on life tables. Although the proposed method can also be applied without scaling IFRs, it should be pointed out that life tables are available for most countries of the world, so that this data requirement does not limit the method's application. Indirect estimation procedures have been used earlier to derive the number of infections, although they often do not account for age structure (Vollmer and Bommer 2020) and do not rescale IFRs (Manski and Molinari 2020) .",

The scaling step allows to transfer the best IFR estimates available globally from a reference population to a target population. The age-specific IFRs are scaled to match total mortality differentials between a reference and a target country; this indirectly adjusts for underlying differences in age structure, health status, and the health care service. The scaling makes use of the demographic concept of remaining life expectancy, sometimes called thanatological age. It maps IFRs between a reference and a target country so that people of an age group in the target population get the same IFR as people of another age group in the reference population if they do have the very same number of remaining life years. For example, assume that 60-year-olds in a reference population have the very same 20 years of life left as 63year-olds in a population of interest. We then map the IFR of the 60-year-olds in the reference population onto the 63-year-olds in the target population, accounting for lower mortality in the reference country.",

Figure 1 shows this relationship for the 10 countries that have reported most COVID-19 deaths as of April 17, 2020. The U.S. has the largest number of reported deaths from COVID-19, close to 37k, and the largest number of confirmed cases, close to 700k. We use Hubei instead of China in our analysis, as more than 96% of COVID-19 deaths reported in China have occurred in this province, which has approximately 60 million residents and a comparable age structure to China (National Bureau of Statistics China 2018).",

Italy, Belgium, the Netherlands, the U.K., Spain, France, and Iran have experienced more COVID-19 deaths per confirmed cases than Hubei, the U.S., and Germany so far. The variation in CFRs can be driven by several factors, among them \"real\" differences arising from different age-specific mortality risks among the infected (Dowd et al. 2020; Dudel et al. 2020) . However, the variation in CFRs may also reflect other factors such as differences in testing intensity (Ward 2020; Hasell et al. 2020 ) and test specificity (W\u00f6lfel et al. 2020; Hasell et al. 2020) ; variation in the age structure of the confirmed cases (Dudel et al. 2020) ; and the stage of progress of the COVID-19 outbreak (Lourenco et al. 2020 ). In addition, variation in the way deaths are classified to COVID-19 versus non-COVID-19 deaths may also explain some of the cross-country differences in CFR. Roser et al.

For example, people dying in senior residences or alone at home could be missing in official statistics (The Economist April 4, 2020) . Another source of error are inconsistent practices for defining COVID-19 deaths: for example, counting all cases that have had COVID-19, or counting only cases for whom COVID-19 has been the primary cause of death (and later also secondary cause of death), or counting only persons who have been hospitalized for treatment of COVID-19. In addition, the testing practices and testing coverage may also be insufficient to detect all people that have died from COVID-19 ). This could especially lead to fewer death counts than there actually are, and studies analyzing excess mortality would be helpful to quantify this bias (Leon et al. 2020) . We argue, however, that the number of reported deaths are more reliable than confirmed cases from COVID-19. That is why we select COVID-19 death as core empirical input in our estimation approach. Moreover, we also discuss a simple way to assess the potential effect of overand underreporting of COVID-19 deaths on our results.",

We use these credible intervals to generate estimates of the uncertainty (prediction intervals) of the number of infected individuals. Both the population counts and the IFRs are by 10-year age groups, 0 \u2212 9, 10 \u2212 19, \u2026, 80 +. We disaggregate COVID-19 total deaths into the same 10-year age groups using the global average pattern over age that we determined based on the data provided by Dudel et al. (2020) . We report our findings in relative terms, population share of COVID-19 infections ( ), and in absolute terms, COVID-19 infections ( ). Details about the model setup and additional findings based on unadjusted age-specific infection fatality are given in the appendices A through E. Figure 2 shows the total number of confirmed COVID-19 infections as of April 17, 2020, as well as the estimated total number of confirmed cases based on our approach of scaling infection fatality rates to match remaining lifetime. Our estimates suggest that across the countries, the total number of infections is approximately 4 times that of confirmed cases. For example, for the U.S. with 700k confirmed cases we estimate that the total number of infections might range between approximately 630k and 3 million, with a point estimate of 1.4 million infected cases. For a large number of countries, the point estimate for the number of infections is, however, more than 5 times the number of confirmed cases. For example, for Italy we estimate approximately 1 million infections, whereas the total number of confirmed cases amounts to 170k. Germany, where testing has been comparatively extensive, stands out as our results suggests that the number of infections is only 1.2 times that of confirmed cases (170k versus 140k). Note that confirmed cases within 95% prediction intervals do not indicate model error, but rather effective testing in a country as many people being and having been infected with COVID-19 get detected.",

Third, Hubei province is an exception to this pattern, as its estimated population share of COVID-19 infections follows a logistic curve that flattens before reaching 0.2%. This may indicate that the COVID-19 epidemic has been successfully contained.

For our estimated infection rate to be explained by underreporting and assuming the seroprevalence estimate was true would require that only one in three COVID-19 related deaths is registered as such, or even less. For the city of Robbio in Italy, Bendavid et al. (2020) cite a seroprevalence of 10%, and for the German municipality of Gangelt a seroprevalence of 14%. To be compatible with our point estimates of 1.7% (Italy) and 0.2% (Germany) would require massive underreporting -in case of Italy less than one in five COVID-19 related deaths would be recorded, in Germany less than two in 100 deaths. However, working with the upper bound of our estimates instead requires only one in two COVID-19 related deaths to be missed for the U.S. and Italy, which might potentially be possible, while for Germany the number is still unrealistically high.

Despite efforts to carefully monitor the COVID-19 pandemic, the number of confirmed cases is likely to severely underestimate the total number of infections. To arrive at useful first estimates of the total number of infections, we develop a demographic scaling model that is broadly applicable as it is based on little input data: deaths attributable to COVID-19, COVID-19 infection fatality rates, and life tables. As many countries lack reliable age-specific IFR estimates, we map them from a reference country onto countries of interest based on remaining life expectancy. This scaling reflects the age structure, the health status, and the health care system of the target country. The scaled infection fatality rates can be used in combination with COVID-19 attributable deaths to calculate first estimates of the total number of infected.",

The uncertainty, however, is high, as the lower bound of the 95% credible interval suggests, on average, twice as many infections than confirmed cases, and the upper bound even 10 times as many. Country-specific variation is high. For Italy, our estimates suggest that the total number of infected is approximately 1 million, or almost 6 times the country-specific confirmed cases. For the U.S., our estimate of 1.4 million is close to being twice as large as the number of confirmed cases, and the upper bound of 3 million is more than 4 times the number of confirmed cases. For Germany, where testing has been comparatively extensive, we estimate that the total number of infected is only 1.2 times (upper bound: close to 3 times) the number of confirmed cases.",

More specifically, the proposed approach can be used to analyze (1) how many more or less deaths or (2) how much lower infection fatality rates would have needed to be observed in order to match seroprevalence. Serological studies may be incorrect as they have not been scaled up to national levels yet and may produce false negatives and false positives (e.g. Petherick 2020). Comparing our estimates for the U.S., Italy, and Germany with results from non-representative seroprevalence studies shows that the latter usually provide rather high estimates, which in case of Germany are unlikely to apply to the total population.",

This assumption does not hold for all countries as reported deaths from COVID-19 have been shown to be underestimated in some regions that are heavily affected by COVID-19 epidemic. For example, people dying in senior residences or alone at home could be missing in official statistics (The Economist April 4, 2020) , and there could also be a delay of several days between the date of deaths and the date of reporting deaths. Another source of error are changing practices for defining COVID-19 deaths and poor test coverage: for example, counting only cases for whom COVID-19 has been the primary cause of death (and later also secondary cause of death) or counting only persons who have been hospitalized for treatment of COVID-19 ). This could especially lead to fewer death counts than there actually are. However, we argue that the number of reported deaths are more reliable than confirmed cases from COVID-19, which is also the reason why we select them as core empirical input in our estimation approach. If numbers of total deaths were too small, the estimated number of infections would be biased downwards and vice versa. However, if deaths .

This assumptions implies that the implemented control measures for monitoring, treating, postponing, and preventing severe COVID-19 patients are similarly effective for a reference country and a target country, after we have controlled for their differences in age structure, health conditions, and medical service. Although scaling infection fatality rates between a reference and a target country increases the applicability of this estimation approach, such borrowing strategies do not fully reflect country-specific trends. It is also important to note that using infection fatality rates of epidemiological studies (based on nasopharyngeal swabs or, even better, populationrepresentative serological studies) would be preferable over estimates of other models in order to avoid circling effects between different modeling approaches.",

The less the underlying model assumptions hold in a country of interest, the more speculative the estimation of COVID-19 infections becomes. The quality of required input data differs strongly among countries; and if the numbers of reported deaths and infection fatality rates attributable to COVID-19 are incorrect, the model estimates of COVID-19 infections are also likely to be wrong (or to miss the mark). Another point of criticism could be the time lag between infection with and eventual death from COVID-19, as the course of this new respiratory disease could take several weeks (Baud et al. 2020 , Zhou et al. 2020 , ICNARC 2020)-a characteristic of COVID-19 that is not accounted for in this straightforward approach. One option to adjust for the time lag between onset of infection and death could be to compare estimated infections with confirmed cases 18 days ago, as, for example, Zhou et al. (2020) find 18 days to be the average duration until death from COVID-19. Accounting for this time lag would lead to higher estimates of infections as shown in appendix F. However, finding the correct counterpart of confirmed cases is not straightforward. For example, data about time to death vary (e.g. Baud et al. 2020 , Zhou et al. 2020 ) and the number of infections is rising exponentially at an early stage of the pandemic, so that shifting only a few days back and forth could largely impact the estimated number of unknown infections with COVID-19.",

The uncertainty, however, is high, as the lower bound of the 95% credible interval suggests on average five times as many infections than confirmed cases, and the upper bound even 28 times as many. Country-specific variation is high. For Italy, our modal estimates suggest that the total number of infected is approximately 1 million, or almost 10 times higher than the countryspecific confirmed cases. For the U.S., our modal estimate of 1.4 million is more than eight times as large as the number of confirmed cases, and the upper bound of 3 million is more than 18 times higher than the number of confirmed cases. For Germany, where testing has been comparatively extensive, we estimate that the total number of infected is only 2.5 times higher (upper bound: close to six times higher) than the number of confirmed cases.",
