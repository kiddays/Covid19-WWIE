In sputum, 17 patients (51.5%) had undetectable viral RNA within 22 days (short persistence), and 16 (48.5%) had persistent viral RNA more than 22 days (long persistence). Three patients (9.1%) had a detectable relapse of viral RNA in sputum within two weeks of their discharge from the hospital. One patient had persistent viral RNA for 59 days or longer. The median (IQR) seroconversion time of anti-S IgM, anti-RBD IgM, and anti-N IgM was 10.5 (7.75-15.5) days, 14 (9-24) days, and 10 (7-14) days, respectively. The median (IQR) seroconversion time of anti-S IgG, anti-RBD IgG, and anti-N IgG was 10 (7.25-16.5) days, 13 (9-17) days, and 10 (7-14) days, respectively. By week 8 after symptom onset, IgM were negative in many of the previously positive patients, and IgG levels remained less than 50% of the peak levels in more than 20% of the patients.

After eight weeks from symptom onset, IgM were negative in many of the previously positive patients, and IgG levels remained less than 50% of the peak levels in more than 20% of the patients. In about 40% of the patients, anti-RBD IgG levels increased 4-time higher in convalescence than in acute phase. Long persistence of SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA in sputum and stool presents challenges for management of the infection. The IgM/IgG comb test is better than single IgM test as a supplement diagnostic tool.

In most of the known viral infections, seroconversion of IgM occurs earlier than seroconversion of IgG. [21] [22] [23] [24] Hence, specific IgM is often used as a diagnostic marker for acute viral infection. Our results indicate that in SARS-CoV-2 infected patients, simultaneous seroconversion of IgM and IgG was observed in 75% of the patients. Almost no patient had earlier seroconversion of IgM than IgG. Nearly 10% of the patients had negative IgM across the entire study period. To and colleagues also reported that in most of SARS-CoV-2 infected patients, seroconversion of IgG was earlier than IgM, and they thought that this might be due to low sensitivity of their IgM test. 11 Combining the results together, it appears that a single IgM test may not be a reliable index for an auxiliary diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Convalescent IgM/IgG testing will likely be better than single IgM for patients for whom nucleic acid tests are not available, or those who have typical SARS-CoV-2 symptoms but are negative for nucleic acid detection.",

Based on current evidence, the relationship between late treatment and seropositivity for anti-S or anti-RBD IgM is undetermined. It is possible that the higher seropositive rate is due to a longer infection time and delayed treatment.",

Chest CT confirmed that 27 patients (81.8%) had bilateral infiltrates, and six (18.2%) had unilateral infiltrates. The median time period from symptom onset to hospital admission was 3 days (range, 0.5-15; IQR 1.5-7), and the median time of hospitalization was 22 days (range, 16-30; IQR, 18-24).

The most common side effects were elevation of triglycerides(16, 48.5%), elevated transaminases (10, 30.3%) and diarrhea (9, 27.3%).A total of 263 respiratory samples and 135 stool samples were obtained from 33 patients.SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA was detected by real-time reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR). The cross time (Ct) value reflects viral load in the sample. Since the maximum Ct value was 40 in our study, we use L = 40-Ct to indicate the viral load in samples. At the earliest stages of symptom onset, SARS-CoV-2 viral load is higher in throat swabs and sputum, but lower in stool. Viral load in throat swabs declined quickly, and it became undetectable among most patients by three weeks after symptom onset. In sputum, viral load declined slower, and most patients were undetectable by week 5 after onset. Viral load in stool declined steadily, and many patients had persistent viral RNA for more than five weeks (Figure 1). The median (IQR) time of undetectable viral RNA in throat swab, sputum, and stool was 18.5(13.25-22)  days, 22 (18.5-27.5) days, and 17 (11.5-32) days, respectively. Compared to throat swabs, viral loads in sputum and stool declined significantly slower (vs stool, P=0.046; vs sputum, P=0.005). However, the decline of viral loads in sputum and stool showed no significant difference (P=0.391). Since the median time of undetectable viral RNA in sputum was 22 days, we divided the patients into two groups: viral RNA short-persistence (viral RNA undetectable within 22 days) and viral RNA long-persistence (viral RNA persists more than 22 days). In sputum specimens, 17 patients (51.5%) had undetectable viral RNA within 22 days, and 16 patients (48.5%) had persistent viral RNA",

All of the antibodies were tested by a chemiluminescence assay (Nanjing RealMind Biotech Co., Ltd, Nanjing, China). The levels of the antibodies were expressed as arbitrary unit (AU) per microliter (mL), which was defined by the manufacturer.The median (IQR) seroconversion time of anti-S IgM, anti-RBD IgM, and anti-N IgM was 10.5 (7.75-15.5), 14 (9-24), and 10 (7-14) days, respectively. The median (IQR) seroconversion time of anti-S IgG, anti-RBD IgG, and anti-N IgG were 10 (7.25-16.5), 13 (9-17), and 10 (7-14) days, respectively. Anti-RBD antibodies appeared later than anti-S (anti-RBD IgM vs. anti-S IgM, P=0.007; anti-RBD IgG vs. anti-S IgG, P=0.006). Anti-RBD antibodies appeared later than anti-N, but the difference was not statistically significant (anti-RBD IgM vs. anti-N IgM, P=0.054; anti-RBD IgG vs. anti-N IgG, P=0.078). For IgM and IgG seroconversion, IgG was earlier than IgM in many patients for S (4 [12.1%] of 33), RBD (9 [27.3%] of 33), and N (3 [9.1%] of 33), respectively. There was only one patient who had earlier anti-RBD IgM than IgG. Most of the patients showed simultaneous seroconversion of IgM and IgG. When comparing the seropositivity of IgM and IgG across the entire study period, 6 (18.2%), 9 (27.3%), and 14 (42.4%) out of 33 patients had negative IgM of anti-S, anti-RBD, and anti-N, respectively. Three patients (9.1%) were negative for all three IgM antibodies. One patient (3.0%) had negative anti-N IgG, and another patient (3.0%) had negative anti-RBD IgG. All 33 patients (100%) had positive anti-S IgG. For IgM, the median (IQR) peak time of anti-S, anti-RBD, and anti-N was 22 (15.75-32), 25 (18-38), and 14 (9-23) days after symptom onset, respectively. For IgG, the median (IQR) peak time of anti-S, anti-RBD, and anti-N was 30.5 (20.5-39), 30 (22-39), and 28 (17-37) days after symptom onset, respectively. Seropositivity of IgM declined quickly, and by week 8 after symptom onset, IgM were negative in many of the previously positive patients (anti-S, 9 of 27 [33.3%]; anti-RBD, 5 of 24 [20.8%]; anti-N, 12 of 19 [63.2%]). In contrast, IgG remained positive after seroconversion, but the antibody levels still experienced an overall decline, and in more than 20% of the patients (anti-S, 4 [12.1%]; anti-RBD, 7 [21.2%]; anti-N, 7 [21.2%]), IgG levels remained less than 50% of the peak levels",
