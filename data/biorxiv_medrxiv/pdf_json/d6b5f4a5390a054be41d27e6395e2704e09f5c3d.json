            "text": "The urgent need for massively scaled clinical or surveillance testing for SARS-CoV-2 has necessitated a reconsideration of the methods by which respiratory samples are collected, transported, processed and tested. Conventional testing for SARS-CoV-2 involves collection of a clinical specimen with a nasopharyngeal swab, storage of the swab during transport in universal transport medium (UTM), extraction of RNA, and quantitative reverse transcription PCR (RT-qPCR). As testing has scaled across the world, supply chain challenges have emerged across this entire workflow. Here we sought to evaluate how eliminating the UTM storage and RNA extraction steps would impact the results of molecular testing. Using paired mid-turbinate swabs self-collected by 11 individuals with previously established SARS-CoV-2 positivity, we performed a comparison of conventional (swab \u2192 UTM \u2192 RNA extraction \u2192 RT-qPCR) vs. simplified (direct elution from dry swab \u2192 RT-qPCR) protocols. Our results suggest that dry swabs eluted directly into a simple buffered solution (TE) can support molecular detection of SARS-CoV-2 via endpoint RT-qPCR without substantially compromising sensitivity. Although further confirmation with a larger sample size and variation of other parameters is necessary, these results are encouraging for the possibility of a simplified workflow that could support massively scaled testing for COVID-19 control.",

The \"conventional swab\" was placed into the standard 3 mL of Universal Transport Media (UTM), while the \"dry swab\" was allowed to dry at room temperature for 6 hours prior to elution into 200 \u00b5L of TE buffer. Serial dilution was then performed on each medium prior to downstream processing. For conventional swabs, RNA was isolated using the MagnaPure 96 RNA extraction platform using 200 \u00b5L input of viral UTM solution as input and eluting into 50 \u00b5L Roche elution buffer. Dry swabs were processed by first vortexing swab in the presence of TE for 30 seconds followed by brief centrifugation. In principle, the use of detergent could enhance accessibility to the viral genome and aid in detection. Therefore, in parallel, we also tested whether the addition of 1% Triton-X to TE buffer enhanced detection of SARS-CoV-2 from dry swabs. Finally, all samples were assayed using RT-qPCR with primer-probes specific for the SARS-CoV-2 viral genome (Orf1b or Spike gene targets) or primer-probes against the human RNAse P transcript.",

RT-qPCR cycle threshold (Ct) values for the viral genome with both conventional and dry swabs were consistent across replicates, and furthermore similar across the two primer probe pairs ( Figure 1A ). However, contrary to our hypothesis, the addition of detergent resulted in higher Ct values, i.e. less sensitive viral detection ( Figure 1B ). Furthermore, whereas dry swabs eluted into TE buffer + 1% Triton-X performed consistently worse than the conventional protocol, dry swabs eluted into TE buffer alone performed consistently better.",

RT-qPCR against the viral genome showed that every 0.1% increase in detergent concentration of IGEPAL, TritonX or Tween20 resulted in an average Ct increase of 0.43, 0.40 or 0.34 cycles, respectively ( Figure 1C ).

SARS-CoV-2 Ct values for the simplified protocol were consistently lower, including when using both contrived and real-world positive samples, although the differences were not statistically significant and are likely in part due to the elution of dry swabs into a smaller volume. Additional testing using samples collected from a larger cohort of study participants and under a broader range of environmental stressors (e.g. temperature stability studies) is warranted.",

Looking forward, we envision that nasal swabs --self-collected into laboratory ready, barcoded tubes and transported dry --could potentially serve as a common input to a range of SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid tests. This includes gold-standard tests like RT-qPCR, but also potentially new, more scalable modalities including RT-LAMP ( 6 -8 ) and Swab-Seq ( 11 ).",
