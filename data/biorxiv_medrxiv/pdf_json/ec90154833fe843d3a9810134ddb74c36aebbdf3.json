Though 25% of patients were febrile on admission, this may be an underestimation due to possible antipyretic use and/or selection bias. A substantial proportion of patients with Covid-19 displayed abnormal laboratory measurements at the time of admission. These included lymphopenia and elevated inflammatory markers such as D-dimer, CRP, LDH, and ferritin. These trends persisted among those who died and/or received intensive care, both on admission and at the time of ICU transfer. If formal epidemiologic analyses confirm these observations, early laboratory evaluation may be crucial in identifying patients suspected for Covid-19 prior to RT-PCR test result. It may also aid clinicians in identifying patients at high risk of decompensation, ICU admission, and potentially even death. Early identification of highrisk patients could enable timely patient triage and improved resource allocation. Additional work is needed to develop real-time, accurate predictive models for risk stratification in Covid-19, particularly to elucidate the clinical utility of specific laboratory measurements.",

Since Covid-19 testing is frequently repeated in hospitalized patients and initial testing may result in false negatives, we are unable to determine whether patients developed their infection during or before hospital admission. Furthermore, Covid-19 has a variable incubation period of approximately 8-15 days 17 , and patients may present to the hospital several days after initial infection or the onset of symptoms. Thus, we are unable to determine patients' disease duration. Additionally, we separated discharged patients from those who died, but some patients may have expired after discharge. This could affect our listed case mortality rate. Our study is also confined by the inherent limitations (e.g. biases) of EHR data. Although utilizing structured EHR data allows for rapid integration of multiple data streams and real-time analysis, data present only in clinical note text, such as symptoms on presentation are missed.
