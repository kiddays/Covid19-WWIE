The complicated mathematical models are necessary for long-time predictions. The SIR (Susceptible-Infectious-Removed) model are used to obtain the prediction values of the model parameters using the statistical approach for predication the number of infected, susceptible and removed persons [1, 2] . The Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered/Death (SIRD) Model was used to formulate an optimal control problem with an expanded epidemic model to compute (Non-pharmaceutical) implementation strategy.
