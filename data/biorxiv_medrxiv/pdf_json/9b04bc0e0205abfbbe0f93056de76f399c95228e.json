            "text": "Transmission of the SAR-COV-2 virus that causes COVID-19 is largely driven by human behavior and person-to-person contact. By staying home, people reduce the probability of contacting an infectious individual, becoming infected, and passing on the virus. One of the most promising sources of data on time use is smartphone location data. We develop a time use driven proportional mixing SEIR model that naturally incorporates time spent at home measured using smartphone location data and allows people of different health statuses to behave differently. We simulate epidemics in almost every county in the United States. The model suggests that Americans' behavioral shifts have reduced cases in 55%-86% of counties and for 71%-91% of the population, depending on modeling assumptions. Resuming pre-epidemic behavior would lead to a rapid rise in cases in most counties. Spatial patterns of bending and flattening the curve are robust to modeling assumptions. Depending on epidemic history, county demographics, and behavior within a county, returning those with acquired immunity (assuming it exists) to regular schedules generally helps reduce cumulative COVID-19 cases. The model robustly identifies which counties would experience the greatest share of case reduction relative to continued distancing behavior. The model occasionally mischaracterizes epidemic patterns in counties tightly connected to larger counties that are experiencing large epidemics. Understanding these patterns is critical for prioritizing testing resources and back-to-work planning for the United States.",

The modeling consensus is that some version of distancing will need to persist for months, not weeks (Anderson et al., 2020; Ferguson et al., 2020) . However, strong distancing can ultimately give way to isolating infectious individuals and targeted distancing measures with sufficient contact tracing capacity (Kissler et al., 2020) . A new tool in the epidemiological modeling of distancing is time use data from smartphone devices. Time use provides a measuring contact risk with a recognizable unit that has metric properties unlike arbitrary distancing indexes. Here we build on prior epidemiological time use modeling (Bayham and Fenichel, 2016; Bayham et al., 2015; Berry et al., 2018) to adapt the common SEIR framework to a dynamic time use structure that enables differential behavior by health status in order to incorporate smartphone tracking data into a model of the COVID-19 epidemic for every county in the United States. We use these results to characterize the variation in the epidemic and suggest prioritization for testing and targeting for a \"back to work\" strategy across the United States.",

However, behavior is changing rapidly, and there appear to be strong feedbacks between the COVID-19 epidemic and people's behavior (Malik et al., 2020; Villas-Boas et al., 2020) . In prior research, we developed an economic-epidemiological model based on a time-varying conditional proportional mixing structure (Fenichel, 2013; Fenichel et al., 2011) that enables physical distancing behavior to vary based on health state and respond to the state of the epidemic. This structure can readily be adapted to time use with heterogeneous mixing models using empirical time allocation-based contact structures that can be updated within a simulation (Bayham et al., 2015) . These structures can be calibrated using time allocation of Americans as measured by their smartphones' locations.",

The model suggests that some counties are likely still experiencing near exponential growth while in other counties cases have likely peaked. In some cases the peak is due to the county's demographic structure. In others it is due to behavior. In case where the peak is causes by behavioral change, reverting to pre-epidemic behavior will lead to a rapid rise in cases -the case in most urban and suburban counties. We find the cell phone data likely provides unreliable measures in many rural counties. We also find that behavior is unable to explain the epidemic in some counties, however these counties appear to be near highly populated counties with large numbers of cases, suggesting substantial county to county spillover. This suggest county-by-county modeling is likely insufficient for some locations. Finally, isolating infectious individuals is of first order importance. However, allowing recovered individuals, who are assumed immune in the model, to return to a baseline schedules has modest effects on the epidemiological dynamics in most counties, but a strong case reduction effect in a few places. This has implications for how scarce PCR and serological tests are deployed to help plan for reopening the United States.",

After fixing , the biological transmissibility parameter (see methods), we plot the variation in the that would occur as a function of time allocated to public prior to the epidemic (mean time from January 1 through February 15) (Fig 1) . This illustrates the importance of the behavior in estimates. The two counties with the lowest are suburban, Forsyth County, Georgia ( 2.53) and Rockwall County, Texas ( 2.62), followed by the rural Arthur County, Nebraska ( 2.70). However, the right tail is inflated by rural counties where people may be spending more time alone (e.g., driving), but away from their homes and that have low device counts (see methods) and likely poor cell phone coverage. Historical driving time patterns are not useful to check this assumption because of congestion in urban areas during non-epidemic times. The right tail is dominated by counties like Loving County, Texas, Lake and Peninsula Borough, Alaska, and North Slope Borough Alaska. Many of these places are not reporting cases. The distribution in Figure 1 , which has a mean 4.3 and median 4.2 aligns with other estimates of for the United States, e.g., a national mean of 4.0, which was calculated early in the epidemic after some behavioral adjustment (Gunzler and Sehgal, 2020) .

However, there are some counties where cell phone data suggests that behavior has hardly changed, e.g., New York County, New York (Fig 2 panel A) and Rockwall, Texas (Fig 2, panel E) . Indeed, Rockwall, Texas suggests that the baseline behavior may be too conservative if the correct counterfactual scenario is that people would have increased time outside the home because of seasonal changes. Other counties are bending the curve enough to have experienced a peak in cases conditional on current behavior e.g., Queens County New York (Figure 2 panel B) and Forsyth County, Georgia (Figure 2 panel F). These counties have \"flattened the curve,\" as measured by declining active infectious individuals over the last five days. Some counties can have flattened curves or are past the epidemiological peak, but without behavioral change that flattened the curve, e.g., Custer County, Nebraska and Union County, New Mexico (Fig 3) . We note, however, many of these counties have not actually experience epidemics, and the results stem from assuming an epidemic starts in every county once COVID-19 is reported in the state (see sensitivity analysis). There is a third category of county, where behavior is reducing the growth of infectious individuals, but infections are still growing, e.g., New Haven County, Connecticut ( These counties have \"bent the curve,\" but not flattened it. In all counties it is too early to resume \"business as usual.\" Even the counties with low values, e.g., Forsyth County, Georgia need to maintain distancing for at least a month ( Figure 2 , panel F). Moreover, Forsyth County, Georgia illustrates the danger of stopping distancing too early (yellow curve). An important caveat is that the model does not account for interconnections among counties. Therefore, while Queens County and Forsyth County are on a trajectory for a near end of the epidemic, if behavior reverts to baseline and new infectious individuals are introduced into the county, then the epidemic will start again. This is why our model suggests some tightly connected counties, e.g., Queens County, are on a better trajectory than experience suggests.",

Our analysis suggests where the greatest percent and share of cases are avoided is correlated. The reason is that these counties are most likely to be bending, but not flattening the curve, and where there is a substantial number of recovered individuals that can make a difference, e.g., Williamson County, Texas ( Figure 2 , panel D). The model also shows that allowing susceptible and recovered individuals to baseline behavior (cyan curves in Figure 2 ) can lead to slightly more cases than maintaining recent behavioral shifts (green curves in Figure 2 ), in some cases, e.g., Williamson County, Texas. However, it leads to substantially few cases than returning the entire population to baseline (yellow curves in Figure 2 ). This suggests relatively low risk of a track, trace, and isolate program.",

These data provide the median time that cell phones are recorded in the phone's home location aggregated to census block group (600 to 3,000 people). The data appear more reliable when aggregated to the county level. For the average county, Safe Graph tracks an average of 5,639 devices (Fig S2) . According to the Safe Graph data, the average American (population weight by county average) spends 669.7 minutes at home per day. To calculate time in public, first we remove six hours of time as sleep that is unlikely to lead to new contacts (Bayham et al., 2015) . This leaves 410 minutes per day in public, which is similar to the ATUS data after accounting for the 65 minutes the average American spends in a private car per day (Fig 1) . We use Bilinski et al.'s (2020) mean estimate of (which they call ) for Alameda, Contra Costa, Marin, San Francisco, San Mateo, and Santa Clara Counties in California, and divide by the population weighted for those counties of 372.0 minutes to determine 1.33 10 . is interpreted as the probability of infection per minute contact with an infectious individual.",

If people are more likely to spend time out of the home as the weather warms, then our baseline is underestimating the counterfactual epidemic. Second, we use the baseline behavior until the first case is reported in the state, and then impose the time series of actual time use in each county, but allowing individuals to revert to baseline behavior when the data end (currently April 13 th ). By imposing the actual behavior we account for any public policy and compliance with that policy. Third, we take the mean of the last five days of time use and continue that behavior. Fourth, we mimic the third scenario but allow those recovered with immunity to return to baseline when the behavioral data end. Fifth, we allow susceptible individuals and recovered individuals to return to baseline behavior, which is equivalent to reducing the time in public of exposed and infectious individuals, though not complete isolation.",

A county has a flat curve if the slope of the infectious individuals curve over time is less than or equal to zero over the last five days of Safe Graph time use data. It is possible that counties have a flat curve, but have not adapted behavior. This happens in small counties.
