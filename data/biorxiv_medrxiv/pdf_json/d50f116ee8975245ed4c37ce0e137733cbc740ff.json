Yet, data 20 streaming, while considerably visualized, is not accompanied with advanced modelling techniques to provide real-time insights. This study introduces a unified platform which integrates visualization capabilities with advanced statistical methods for predicting the virus spread in the short run, using real-time data. The platform is backed up by advanced time series models to capture any possible non-linearity in the data which is enhanced by the capability of 25 measuring the expected impact of preventive interventions such as social distancing and lockdowns. The platform enables lay users, and experts, to examine the data and develop several customized models with different restriction such as models developed for specific time window of the data. Our policy assessment of the case of Australia, shows that social distancing and travel ban restriction significantly affect the reduction of number of cases, as an effective policy. 30 35 40 45 All rights reserved.

Different types of transformation have been examined to capture the nonlinearity in the time-series data followed by multiple differencing steps to eliminate the non-stationarity status. Notably, we enhanced the time-series model to capture the effect of previous interventions using an exogenous variable which can be used to predict the impact of future interventions. Further, when no record of intervention is provided, the model can infer previous interventions from data and incorporate its estimated impact into future predictions.",

Upon each transformation, the best ARIMA model is obtained for each country, according to Akaike information criterion (AIC) value using 15 maximum likelihood estimation. The optimal model for each transformation is then recorded based on the overall model Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) on the last 20% of observations reported as a surrogate estimate of out-sample prediction performance. The predictive power of the best model per country is compared against estimations provided through 1) exponential growth in number of cases, 2) doubling time of two days, 3) doubling time of 3 days and 4) 20 doubling time of one week, as well as a conventional linear univariate regression on logtransformed data. Table 1 shows the parameters of the optimal ARIMA model per country and the corresponding RMSE measures (of the last 20% of observations) compared with conventional trends (based on ECDC data on April 13, 2020) . While, the purpose of this study is not to develop the most accurate time-series predictive model, statistics of Table 1 clearly show 25 that using a more sophisticated statistical model significantly improves the prediction accuracy of COVID-19 spread in the near future (t-test p-value << 0.001 comparing residuals' distributions), which signifies the urgency of such studies for policy appraisal.

It is built upon the strength of SIR/SIER models in considering the speed of progression and coupled with the capacity of time-series models in 1) considering higher orders of derivatives of the number of cases in previous time intervals, 2) accounting for the impact of residuals of the previous time intervals, and 3) incorporating intervention effect as external 5 variables. We presented an automated modelling platform that delves into multiple layers of information in the COVID-19 time series data to find the best fit with the aim of providing robust forecasts. The platform-unlike numerous counterparts that are primarily limited to disseminating the existing patterns-measures the average impact of previous interventions to reduce the growth of the infected cases. This measure is then used for predicting the future 10 spread when similar interventions are considered to further control the outbreak.",

We elaborated the importance of data transformation as a preprocessing step and shown that there is no transformation operation which consistently provides the best fit to the data. 15 Hence, exploring multiple options are recommended to stabilize variations prior to modelling using conventional econometrics formulations. A unique aspect of the presented platform is that it facilitates real-time model development incorporating latest reported data into modelling. We have shown that such adaptive model estimation significantly improves the prediction power and therefor, forecasting reliability. 20 One major challenge ahead of governments and policymakers, is the uncertainty around the effectiveness of containment policies in controlling the outbreak. Yet, authorities can observe the effectiveness of what they have done in the past few days, weeks, and months and learn from the impact of their previous decisions to enhance their intelligence in proposing new mechanisms to 25 control the outbreak. We have shown that examining the effect of controlling policies can inform policymakers on number and types of controlling policies required to achieve their objective in reducing the number of infected cases. We have shown for Australia, as a case study, that containment policies not only decline the number of infected cases right after implementation, but also reduce the slope of progression. The latter is a more outstanding factor, especially when 30 such policies are coupled with economic related policies given the recession or depression that is expected to happen during or after the COVID-19 pandemic. Overall, given the unknown nature of SARS-CoV-2 spread, we need to relax the boundaries of potential methods, beyond classical epidemic models, to further explore the behavior of data to account for unknown aspects the virus spread. Figure 1 Effect of transformation on modelling performance. Four countries were selected as case studies to demonstrate the effect of ratio and logarithmic transformations on the model performance as measured by RMSE on last (most recent) 20% of time-series data. The solid line shows the observed trend and the dashed lines shows model fitted values without transformation (red) and after ratio (green) or logarithmic (blue) transformation. The bar plot beside each trend graph shows the corresponding RMSE estimations. '*' implies that t-test p-value < 0.05 while '+' implies that p-value < 0.06. * * + * * + All rights reserved.
