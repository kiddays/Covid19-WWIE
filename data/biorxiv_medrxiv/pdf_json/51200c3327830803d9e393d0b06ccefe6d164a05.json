SARS-CoV-2 is an RNA virus whose multiple genomic and subgenomic RNA (sgRNA) transcripts hijack the host cell's machinery, located across distinct cytotopic locations. Subcellular localization of its viral RNA could play important roles in viral replication and host antiviral immune response. Here we perform computational modeling of SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA localization across eight subcellular neighborhoods. We compare hundreds of SARS-CoV-2 genomes to the human transcriptome and other coronaviruses and perform systematic sub-sequence analyses to identify the responsible signals. Using state-of-the-art machine learning models, we predict that the SARS-CoV-2 RNA genome and all sgRNAs are enriched in the host mitochondrial matrix and nucleolus. The 5' and 3' viral untranslated regions possess the strongest and most distinct localization signals. We discuss the mitochondrial localization signal in relation to the formation of double-membrane vesicles, a critical stage in the coronavirus life cycle. Our computational analysis serves as a hypothesis generation tool to suggest models for SARS-CoV-2 biology and inform experimental efforts to combat the virus.",

We predict that SARS-CoV-2 is enriched for localization in the nucleolus and the mitochondria. Comparison of SARS-CoV-2's predicted localization against that of other human coronaviruses, including strains causing the common cold, Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), and the SARS outbreak of 2003, shows that SARS-CoV-2 exhibits a stronger mitochondrial and nuclear localization signal than a large majority of its coronavirus relatives. We additionally find that this localization signal appears to be driven by many redundant motifs spread across the genome, suggesting its importance. We conclude by connecting our observations to known RNA and viral biology, proposing possible explanatory mechanisms for previously observed phenomena. Our analysis suggests experimental validation of our predictions and serves as a framework for applying data science for principled hypothesis generation, enabling targeted response to this and future outbreaks.",

SARS-CoV-2 is believed to enter the cell as a positive strand genomic RNA, subsequently forming 11 positive strand sub-genomic RNA (sgRNA) transcripts encoding different open reading frames and sharing the same 5' leader sequence and 3' untranslated region (UTR) (Figure 1a ). Within each viral genome, we predict the localization of each sgRNA produced from the primary SARS-CoV-2 genome. To provide more context, we frame these predicted localization probabilities relative to the predictions of other relevant \"baseline\" transcript sequences. We consider two such baselines: the distribution of model predictions on transcripts exhibiting significant enrichment within the human HEK293T cell line (n = 366 transcripts) (Fazal et al., 2019) , and the distribution of model predictions on transcripts derived from human coronaviruses, excluding SARS-CoV-2 (n = 191 genomes, spanning diseases from the common cold to MERS, Supplementary Figure 1a ). The human baseline gives us an idea of how strong localization signals within SARS-CoV-2 are, relative to naturally occurring human transcripts with well-characterized localization behaviors. The coronavirus baseline focuses on differences in the localization behavior of SARS-CoV-2 relative to similar viral specimens -differences that may help researchers focus on the particularities of this virus. For both baselines, we calculate the proportion of the baseline distribution that the SARS-CoV-2 localization prediction exceeds, which we refer to as a rank score. For example, a localization score of 0.6 for the nucleolus relative to human transcripts suggests that the particular viral RNA is more likely to localize to the nucleolus compared to 60% of the human RNAs that shows some localization to the nucleolus.",

Additionally, we see an overall pattern suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 may have a greater affinity for nuclear localizations (nuclear pore, nucleus, nucleolus, and nuclear lamina) compared to other coronaviruses.

We specifically investigated the potential contribution of the three main regions of the SARS-CoV-2 genome: the shared 5' leader sequence, the shared 3' UTR, and the variable \"coding\" sequence in the middle. We predicted the localization for each of these regions by itself ( Figure 1e ). The 5' leader sequence shows the strongest localization signal to the mitochondrial matrix, and no signal for the nucleolus. In contrast, the 3' UTR has the strongest localization for the nucleolus and also has strong signal for the mitochondrial matrix. The coding sequence (CDS) also shows specific signals for these two compartments. Because the 5' and 3' sequences are shared by the different SARS-CoV-2 sgRNAs, this is likely a strong factor behind the consistent localization patterns we find across the different sgRNAs. We performed further computational ablation studies of RNA binding protein (RBP) motifs in SARS-CoV-2 and found that the known motifs do not appear to be the primary drivers of the mitochondrial matrix and nucleolus localization patterns. Specifically, computational deletions of all instances of each RBP motif in SARS-CoV-2 sequence, repeated across all enriched RBPs, did not significantly alter the RNA-GPS predictions. This result suggests that the SARS-CoV-2 localization signal is highly redundant within the viral genome.",

However, coronaviruses are known to produce complex double-membrane vesicle (DMV) structures during viral replication, which may serve functions like concealing the virus from cellular defenses (Hagemeijer et al., 2012; Knoops et al., 2008) . While these DMVs are generally believed to be formed via viruses manipulating the ER membrane (Blanchard and Roingeard, 2015) , the mechanism for importing and packaging proteins and RNA into these miniature organelles is not as clearly understood. One possible mechanism for importing viral RNA involves the virus exploiting endogenous RNA localization mechanisms that the cell already possesses for existing double-membrane organelles: namely, the mitochondria. Indeed, introducing just 2 amino acid point mutations in the murine coronavirus can cause both a significant drop in the number of DMV structures observed, as well as a sharp increase in viral protein localization at the mitochondria (Clementz et al., 2008) . This suggests a high degree of resemblance between the DMV and mitochondrial localization mechanisms -leading to the hypothesis that our mitochondrial matrix localization predictions are capturing this similarity between the DMV and mitochondria. Furthermore, DMVs have been shown to contain double-stranded RNA (Hagemeijer et al., 2012) , and our strand-agnostic localization predictions are concordant with this evidence. Under this model, SARS-CoV-2's strong mitochondrial localization signal relative to other coronaviruses may even contribute to its similarly high infectivity by increasing its efficacy in generating and importing materials into these DMV structures.",

Although the sharing of biological machinery between human cells and SARS-CoV-2 coupled with RNA-GPS's strong performance on held-out test datasets leads us to believe that this approach is promising, viral infection also substantially remodels the cell's internal machinery, and the expression of viral RNA binding proteins (not accounted for in our model) can both introduce errors into our predictions. Thus, localization experiments are necessary to validate our computational analyses. Cross-referencing our results against existing literature is somewhat limited, as most studies have focused on the localization of viral proteins rather than viral transcripts. Furthermore, RNA localization is undoubtedly one of many pieces of complex, interconnected mechanisms that this coronavirus adopts, and our hypotheses presented here do not preclude (many) additional critical biological phenomena.",

Additionally, we only use transcripts not used for model training/tuning (i.e. the test data split), as this most closely approximates what the model would predict when presented with novel sequences.

Note that this rank is calculated for each individual compartment separately, as the baselines themselves are compartment specific. For the coronavirus baseline, each SARS-CoV-2 sgRNA is also compared only to homologous sgRNAs from other coronaviruses. For example, the spike protein's localization prediction is only compared against localization predictions of other coronavirus spike proteins. This limits our comparison to the set of genes with easily traceable homology across human coronaviruses, namely ORF1ab, spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M), and nucleocapsid (N) (Woo et al., 2010) .
