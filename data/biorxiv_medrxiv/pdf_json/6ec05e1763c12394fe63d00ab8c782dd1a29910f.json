We analyzed 56 pooled data on liver chemistries stratified by COVID-19 severity using a fixed or 57 random-effects model. 58 Results: In the meta-analysis of 37 studies, which included a total of 6,235 patients, 59 the pooled mean alanine aminotransferase (ALT) was 36.4 IU/L in the severe 60 COVID-19 cases and 27.8 IU/L in the non-severe cases (95% confidence interval [CI]: 61 \u22129.4 to \u22125.1, p < 0.0001). The pooled mean aspartate aminotransferase (AST) was 62 46.8 IU/L in the severe cases and 30.4 IU/L in the non-severe cases (95% CI: \u221215.1 to 63 \u221210.4, p < 0.0001). Furthermore, regardless of disease severity, the AST level is often 64 higher than the ALT level. Compared with the non-severe cases, the severe cases 65 tended to have higher \u03b3-glutamyltransferase levels but lower albumin levels. 66 Conclusions: In this meta-analysis, we comprehensively described three patterns of 67 liver impairment related to COVID-19, namely hepatocellular injury, cholestasis, and 68 hepatocellular disfunction, according to COVID-19 severity. Patients with abnormal 69 liver test results are at higher risk of progression to severe disease. Close monitoring 70 of liver chemistries provides an early warning against disease progression.",

In response to the emerging threat posed by 86 COVID-19, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-87 2), the WHO has declared a Public Health Emergency of International Concern on 88 January 30, 2020, which was further labeled as a pandemic on March 11, 2020. 89 Similarly, the other two previously identified coronaviruses, namely SARS-CoV and 90 Middle East Respiratory Syndrome-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 causes severe viral 91 pneumonia in humans. As no specific acquired immunity exists in the general 92 population, SARS-CoV-2 has high infectivity, which has resulted in an ongoing 93 global health crisis. 94 Apart from the respiratory system, the urinary system, gastrointestinal tract, and even 95 the central nervous system are the probable target organs of SARS-CoV-2, which 96 utilizes the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors of the respiratory and 97 gastrointestinal tracts as the entry point for epithelial cells [2]. Among patients' 98 common complaints related to COVID-19 are gastrointestinal symptoms, including 99 nausea/vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal pain [3-6]. Abundant ACE2 protein 100 expression in the glandular cells of gastric, duodenal, and rectal epithelia supports the 101 entry of SARS-CoV-2 into the host epithelial cells [7]. Single-cell RNA sequencing 102 has revealed a specific ACE2 expression in cholangiocytes [8]. Thus, performing liver 103 chemistry tests for a number of patients with COVID-19 seems reasonable. In fact, 104 several studies have found liver injury in patients with COVID-19 [9-13].",

Lopinavir/ritonavir use during hospitalization has been reported to 255 possible lead to liver damage [9, 52]. The liver chemistry tests in the enrolled studies 256 were all performed on admission, which suggests that the influences of the drugs on 257 the liver tests, if any, should be minor. 258 ALB level and PT are known to reflect hepatocellular function. Albumin, which has a 259 circulating half-life of 3 weeks, is a plasma protein exclusively synthesized by the 260 liver [53]. Hypoalbuminemia results from and reflects the inflammatory state, which 261 leads to inflammatory exudate. Effective nutrition support helps to correct 262 hypoalbuminemia [54]. Our meta-analysis revealed that ALB level was lower in the 263 severe cases than in the non-severe cases, which indicated that the severe cases tended 264 to have more intense inflammation and require more solid nutrition support. PT is a 265 far more sensitive measure of hepatocellular function than ALB level because PT may 266 be prolonged in patients with severe liver disease duration of <24 h [14]. In 267 accordance with the alteration of the ALB level, PT was prolonged in the severe cases, 268 which further indicated impairment of hepatocellular function in the severe cases [53]. 269 According to our meta-analysis, another interesting feature of liver impairment related 270 to COVID-19 is that the AST level often overrides the ALT level, especially in severe 271 cases. By contrast, in patients with chronic hepatitis B or nonalcoholic fatty liver 272 disease, the ALT level is generally higher than the AST level. Although ALT is 273 present primarily in the liver and is a more specific marker of hepatocellular injury, 274 the distribution of AST is far wider than that of ALT, including the cardiac muscle, 275 skeletal muscle, kidney, and brain [14]. An elevated AST level accompanied by a 276 normal ALT level often suggests cardiac or muscle disease. In fact, cardiac injury is 277 frequent in severe cases of COVID-19, especially in deceased patients [25, 55].",

Most 287 observations focused on ALT, AST, and ALB levels. However, cholestasis-related 288 impairment (e.g., abnormal AKP and GGT levels) tended to be inadvertently ignored.289Moreover, we also compared hepatocellular dysfunction between the severe and non-290 severe cases. The alarmingly high prevalence of hypoalbuminemia in the severe cases 291 prompts further nutrition support in severe cases. In addition, coagulation dysfunction 292 in severe cases requires vigilance. Third, the enrolled studies included multiple 293 observations not only from mainland China but also from other ethnic groups. This 294 facilitates the assessment of abnormal liver chemistries related to COVID-19 in a 295 broader ethnic context. Fourth, eligible studies preprinted in medRxiv and bioRxiv 296 were also covered, which ensured that our analysis has a clear leading position. 297 However, our study has a few limitations. As mentioned earlier, cholestasis-related 298 indexes such as AKP/GGT level may be under-reported in quite a number of studies, 299 which may lead to less precise pooled data. Second, most studies came from mainland 300 China, which precluded a more precise estimate of the abnormalities of liver 301 chemistries in the other ethnic groups.
