[1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] These are significantly higher than the published mortality rates ranging from 35-46% for patients intubated with H1N1 influenza pneumonia and other causes of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). [7] [8] [9] [10] These high mortality rates have raised concerns as to whether invasive mechanical ventilation should be avoided in the context of COVID-19. 11-14 To help address the growing concern that critical illness, and specifically mechanical ventilation, are associated with a high risk of death, we conducted a retrospective cohort study of critically ill patients with COVID-19 across our academic health system.",

[11] [12] [13] [14] 17 In contrast to the majority of prior reports, our data provide evidence that mortality rates in COVID-19 can be comparable to those seen with ARDS and other infectious pneumonias.

First, the arrival and peak of the COVID-19 pandemic in Georgia were later than in many of the regions from earlier reports. This delay provided time to establish organizational structures, acquire equipment, prepare personnel, create consensus-driven clinical protocols, and align resources across a large healthcare system. In addition, while patient volumes did merit the re-designation of several specialty intensive care units as COVID ICUs, all critically ill patients with COVID-19 were admitted to pre-existing ICUs and cared for by critical care teams with experience managing acute respiratory failure and at standard patient-to-provider ratios. Further, while an analysis of the impact of clinical interventions on survival is beyond the scope of this brief report, our internal guidelines emphasized early intubation and standard lung-protective ventilation strategies. Future studies are needed to better understand the impact of individual patient risk factors, clinical interventions and treatments, and health system factors that can improve mortality in the face of this global pandemic.",

A total of 143 (65.9%) patients required vasopressor support for shock and 63 (29.0%) required renal replacement therapy, either in the form of continuous renal replacement therapy or intermittent hemodialysis. Use of inhaled pulmonary vasodilators was relatively uncommon (22 [10.1%]) and four (1.8%) patients received extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). Overall, 114 (52.5%) patients received at least one dose of hydroxychloroquine and 49 (22.6%) patients were enrolled in the NIH-funded adaptive clinical treatment trial (ACTT) of remdesivir (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT04280705). ICU Outcomes Among the 217 patients in the cohort, 129 (59.4%) have been transferred alive from the ICU, 52 (23.9%) died in the ICU (four additional deaths occurred among patients transferred to the floor), and 36 (16.6%) remain in the ICU, of whom 14 (38.9%) are still mechanically ventilated (Figure 1a). The median ICU length of stay for patients still in the ICU is 12 days (IQR 10-18). Among patients who received invasive mechanical ventilation, ICU mortality is 28.5% (47/165) and hospital mortality is 29.7% (49/165) (Figure 1b).
