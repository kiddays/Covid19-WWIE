Our models control for several covariates, including other flu-like symptoms, sex, education, income, whether the respondent worked in February, household size, population density in the respondent's ZIP code, state fixed effects, and the day of completion of the survey.

We find that having at least one COVID-19 symptom (fever, dry cough, or shortness of breath) increased the likelihood of going out the previous day and having additional close contacts with non-household members; however, the estimates were not statistically significant. When disaggregating our analysis by COVID-19 symptoms, we find no strong evidence of greater social distancing by people with a fever or cough in the last two weeks, but we do find that those who experienced shortness of breath have fewer close contacts, with an incidence rate ratio (IRR) of 0.49 (95% CI: 0.30-0.78). Having other flulike symptoms reduces the odds of going out by 0.32 (95% CI: 0.18-0.60) and the incidence rate of having close contacts by 42 percent (IRR = 0.58; 95% CI: 0.38-0.88). We find that older people are just as likely to leave their homes as younger people, but people over the age of 50 had less than half the predicted number of close contacts than those who were younger than 30. Our approach has the limitation that the survey sample is self-selected. Our findings may therefore be subject to selection bias that is not adequately controlled for by weighting. In addition, the possibility exists of confounding of the results due to omitted variable bias.",

Our second outcome measure is based on the question: \"Excluding members of your household, how many people in total did you come into close contact with (within 6 feet) yesterday?\" This question aims to capture those contacts that a respondent had as a result of going outside the home and those contacts who came into the respondent's home in the last day.

Similarly, we use the Poisson model to calculate the expected number of close contacts yesterday for different age groups and symptoms, fixing other covariates at their mean values. Table 1 presents unweighted descriptive statistics for our sample. We present data from 4,676 responses collected over 4 days. Slightly more than 20 percent of our sample reports at least one common symptom of COVID-19 in the last two weeks. By far the most common of these reported symptoms is a dry cough (14.9 percent), while the proportions of respondents who report a fever (3.7 percent) and shortness of breath (7.5 percent) are lower. Other flu-like symptoms were reported by 6.4 percent of the sample. About 55 percent of respondents in the sample report having left their home yesterday (the day before they completed the survey). Only 49 percent of respondents report any close contact with any non-household member in the previous day. However, 3.7 percent of respondents report having had more than 10 close contacts in the previous day. Table 1 shows that our sample skews heavily toward highly educated groups, is predominantly female, and comprises mainly younger adults. Slightly more than 70 percent of the sample report making more than $50,000 a year, while 81 percent report working for pay in February.

This age gradient is in line with the WHO and CDC recommendations that older people should take special precautions, because they are more likely to develop a severe illness if they contract COVID-19.

While having a cough in the last two weeks has a high prevalence in our sample (see Figure 1 ), most of these cases are quite likely not due to COVID-19, but to other conditions. While cough is a common symptom of COVID-19, the probability of having COVID-19 given that someone has a cough may be very low. People may understand this intuitively and therefore may not be social distancing when they have a cough. Shortness of breath, and other flu-like symptoms, are comparatively rare, and people may be using these as stronger indicators that they may have COVID-19, and hence undertake greater social distancing. The lack of effect for fever, however, is surprising in this interpretation.",

However, our evidence suggests that people with some symptoms, particularly shortness of breath and other flu-like symptoms, are undertaking more intense social distancing. Overall, the issue seems to be one of mismatch between the symptoms that people are using to inform their social distancing behavior and the symptoms of COVID-19 that are listed by the WHO and CDC. This mismatch could be a pure messaging issue, but the symptoms that are listed by the CDC and WHO could also lack sensitivity and specificity, and may not actually by thought by the public to be reliable guides to having COVID-19.",

The first recommendation is that in addition to listing the common symptoms of COVID-19, public health authorities should give clear guidance on what symptoms signal a strong likelihood of having COVID-19, and should lead to more intense social distancing, which may be quite different[19]. Ideally, a simple algorithm would calculate the probability of infection based on easily observable symptoms, with high specificity and sensitivity[19, 26]. The second recommendation is that messaging should be clear regarding how people should respond if they have symptoms and are likely to have COVID-19.19.
