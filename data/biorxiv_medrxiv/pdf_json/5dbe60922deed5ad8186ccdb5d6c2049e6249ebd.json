As the data is rapidly emerging from earlier outbreak locations around the world, there are efforts to assimilate this with the knowledge from prior epidemics and find rapid solutions for this. One of the observations and a recurring theme is the disproportionate differences in the incidence of infection and the consequent mortality between males and females. We, therefore, analyzed retrospective datasets from the previous epidemics and the ongoing pandemic in order to address these differences in clinical outcomes. The data shows that even though the infection rates are similar, the odds ratio of male mortality remains high, indicating a divergence in the crosstalk between the three pathogenic human Coronavirus (hCoVs)-the SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and the SARS-CoV-2 and immune effectors in the two sexes. One proximate cause is the sex-specific modulation of the X-linked genes that can influence susceptibility to infection. Future studies are needed to confirm these findings, which can form the basis for developing rational strategies for ending the current and preventing future pandemics.",

However, unlike the seasonal strains, the SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV2 strains cause outbreaks of severe respiratory disease in humans [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] . While SARS-and MERS-CoV spread among humans was limited, the current strain of SARS-coV-2 is rapidly being transmitted from human to human by aerosol or by direct contact leadings to severe symptoms with accompanying pneumonia and acute respiratory distress in many patients. There are many similarities between COVID 19 and previous two similar outbreaks of human CoVs (hCoVs)-SARS that infections, including 774 deaths in 29 countries and an estimated CFR of 9.6% globally, while the MERS outbreak was estimated to have a much higher CFR of 34.5% with more than 2500 infections to date 12 . Although several studies have shown an estimated R0 of 2.2 for COVID19, there is a broad range of values for the CFR given the inability to estimate during the early phase of this outbreak realiably. The risk for mortality shows an increase in the elderly population 13 and in those with certain pre-existing conditions related to decreased or marginal cardiac, pulmonary, renal functions, and immunosuppressive states.

The incidence of COVID-19 and MERS seems to be more common among males, but SARS appears to be more common among females (Table 1 and   Table 3a ). The SARS epidemic in 2003 showed differences in incidence and mortality between males and females. Out of a total of 8098 SARS infections from 27 different countries-slightly more than half were female (World Health Organization, 2003). However, females had lower mortality rates from SARS than males, a pattern that is maintained after adjusting for age 16 . In the data reported from Hong Kong SAR, the mortality rate for males was 21.9%, which was substantially higher than the mortality rate for females of 13.2% 10 . The table 1 below is based on three studies from China 4,5 . If one investigates whether the probability of being male is equivalent to being female (i.e., 50%), one would conclude that males were more likely to have the infection. Further review of CFR from SARS, MERS, and the ongoing COVID indicate a preferential outcome according to biological sex ( Table 2 and Table 3b ). In terms of mortality, males had increased deaths compared to females from MERS, SARS-CoV, and SARS-CoV2.",

There is also a possibility that the apparent sex imbalance could reflect more exposure to the males because of frequent travel and contacts, as was reported in the MERS Saudi Arabian cohort. Since the virus appears to be transmitted primarily through large droplets and remains in aerosols for up to 3 days 19 , another factor that needs discussion is the gender differences in handwashing, particularly in public restrooms and airports. In a 2003 study of 175 individuals (95 women and 80 men) handwashing after restrooms use, indicated that women washed their hands with soap more often than men (61%vs. 37%) in the absence of a prompt to do so 20 . When a visual reminder was placed, the numbers went up for women but remained more or less the same for men (97% vs. 35%). Indeed emphasis on handwashing with soap and the extent of time is one of the most effective interventions to prevent the spread across all age-groups and gender 21 .",

Ongoing research approaches should actively explore this area so that the knowledge derived can overcome this and prevent future pandemics.

Moreover, aging studies in both sexes indicate diminished innate immune responses, and further analysis utilizing co-morbidities may provide the predilection for clinical worsening seen with this infection 13, 32 .
