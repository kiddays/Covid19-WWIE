In this setting, the existing drugs chloroquine (CQ) and hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) which has suggestive evidence of efficacy against SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 disease has become prime candidates to be repositioned as therapeutic and preventative agents, and a growing number of clinical trials have been registered to study their preventative potential for at-risk populations using a range of dosing schemes and outcome measures. This rapid systematic review protocol aims to provide streamlined and timely synthesis on methodologies and results of randomized controlled trials assessing the efficacy of CQ and HCQ in hopes that this will constructively inform further research as well as public health policy.",

In case of discrepancy between the two researchers, a third party will be asked to apply the scale to independently address the discrepancy. Additionally, researchers intend to qualitatively summarize the risk of bias across different studies for each of six domains: (1) random sequence generation (2) allocation concealment (3) blinding methods (4) incomplete outcome data (5) selective outcome reporting (6) other biases, as referenced by the Cochrane collaboration network (Higgins et al., 2011) .",
