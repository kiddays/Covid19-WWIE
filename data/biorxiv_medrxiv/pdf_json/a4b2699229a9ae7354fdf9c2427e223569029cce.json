However, most methods for estimating the basic reproductive number (R0) and time-varying effective reproductive number (Rt) assume that the fraction of cases detected and reported is constant through time. We explore the impact of secular changes in diagnostic testing and reporting on estimates of R0 and Rt using simulated data. We then compare these patterns to data on reported cases of COVID-19 and testing practices from different United States (US) states. We find that changes in testing practices and delays in reporting can result in biased estimates of R0 and Rt. Examination of changes in the daily number of tests conducted and the percent of patients testing positive may be helpful for identifying the potential direction of bias. Changes in diagnostic testing and reporting processes should be monitored and taken into consideration when interpreting estimates of the reproductive number of COVID-19.",

First, the real-time quantitative PCR assay developed and distributed by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) suffered from performance issues (2, 3) . As a result, all initial and confirmatory testing needed to be carried out by the CDC, which led to reporting delays and capacity issues early in the epidemic (4, 5) . Initially, tests were only administered to individuals with a history of travel to certain countries or known contact with a positive case. By the time testing capacity increased, state and local health departments were faced with heavy demand for COVID-19 testing. Only individuals meeting specific criteria could receive a test, and these criteria have varied from state to state and over time (see Supporting Information (SI) Dataset).",

These models typically rely on estimates of the reproductive number of the virus. The basic reproductive number (R0) is defined as the expected number of secondary infections produced by an infectious individual in a fully susceptible population; this can be used to derive the expected fraction of the population that will become infected in the absence of interventions and the level of control and/or immunity that is needed to eliminate the pathogen from circulation (6) . The time-varying effective reproductive number (Rt) measures the average number of secondary infections per case at each time-point in the epidemic (6) , and can be used for real-time monitoring of the impact of control measures (7) (8) (9) . As control measures are implemented and immunity increases in the population, Rt will decrease (6, 10) . The value of R0 can be estimated from the growth rate of the number of cases early on in the epidemic and estimates of the distribution of the generation time (i.e. the time between infection events of successive cases in a transmission chain) (11) , whereas instantaneous values of Rt can be estimated based on the time series of case notifications and the distribution of the generation time (7) . These methods have been shown to be robust to under-detection and underreporting, so long as the probability that a true case is detected and reported remains constant through time.",

            "text": "Based on our simulations (Table S1, Fig. S1 ), the likelihood and degree to which R0 and Rt are biased depends on the manner in which diagnostic testing practices and reporting changes over time. When the fraction of incident cases detected and reported is constant over time and testing capacity scales with the number of \"true\" cases, the number of confirmed positive cases provides an unbiased estimate of R0, despite possible delays in the reporting process (Fig. 1A,  Fig. S2 ). In this instance, the percent of individuals testing positive is expected to be stable over time. Estimates of Rt are also expected to be unbiased after the first 5-6 days (approximately equal to the mean reporting delay), but lag 2-4 days behind in detecting a decrease in Rt below the threshold value of 1 (i.e. when the epidemic is receding). If the fraction of true cases detected and reported is increasing or decreasing linearly over time, estimates of R0 based on the growth rate of confirmed cases will be over-or under-estimates, respectively, of the true R0 ( Fig. 1B-C) . The time-varying reproductive number, Rt, will also be slightly over-or underestimated, especially early on when there is a reporting delay. A gradual increase or decrease in the percent of individuals testing positive is a potential indicator of such bias. However, the percent positive is also expected to decrease or increase over time if the testing capacity expands more or less quickly than the number of true cases, respectively ( Fig. 1D-E) . In this instance, estimates of R 0 and R t based on the number of confirmed cases are unbiased ( .

Abrupt changes to testing criteria, affecting the fraction of true cases detected and reported, are also expected to bias estimates of R0 and lead to a large (up to two-fold) but temporary bias in estimates of Rt ( Fig. 2A-B) . The potential for such bias may be indicated by a sudden change in the percent of individuals testing positive, as well as a temporary change to the slope of the log of cumulative cases. A similar change in the percent positive may also occur with an abrupt change to the testing capacity ( Fig. 2C-D) . However, in this case, it is accompanied by a change to the slope of the log of cumulative individuals tested, and estimates of R0 and Rt based on fitting to the number of positive cases are not expected to be biased. The most difficult bias to detect may be due to a change in the reporting delay distribution (Fig. 2E-F) . In this case, the percent positive is likely to remain roughly constant through time, but estimates of R0 and Rt will be biased, especially when the reporting delay increases. is the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.

Estimates of R0 for all 50 states and the District of Columbia vary from 1.92 (95% CI: 1.61-2.27, South Dakota) to 5.17 (95% CI: 4.75-5.65, Missouri) ( Table S2) .

Nationally, the percent of individuals testing positive for COVID-19 decreased from 20-25% in early March to around 15% in mid-March. This early decline in the percent positive is likely attributable to an increase in testing capacity, rather than a decrease in the fraction of true cases detected and reported; therefore, estimates of R0 based on the number of confirmed cases should be unbiased. However, trends in the percent of tests positive vary by state (Fig. 4) . Estimates of Rt for the US and individual states were generally high (Rt>4) initially but decreased over time (Fig. S4 ).

Due to the limited availability of tests early on, most states recommended that only those with a history of travel to affected countries or known contact with a confirmed case be tested (4, 5) . Since the disease has become more widespread throughout the US and testing capacity has increased, testing guidelines have been relaxed, but there are still considerable differences from state to state (SI Dataset). For example, as of April 6, 2020, Washington state had no restrictions on who can be tested for COVID-19, but prioritized hospitalized individuals and essential service providers exhibiting symptoms (14) . As of April 15, New York still recommended restricting testing to those with a known positive contact or travel history, as well as symptomatic individuals who had tested negative for other infections (15). As testing practices change over time, we have demonstrated that these changes may introduce bias into estimates of R0 and Rt, affecting inference about how much control is needed and when control measures have reduced transmission below the critical threshold necessary to sustain the epidemic.",

However, more recent analyses estimate a median R0 of 5.7 (95% CI 3.8, 8.9) (17). Analysis of data from Europe and the US present a similarly high R0, with median values ranging from 4.0 to 7.1 when assuming a serial interval of 6-9 days (18). Our estimated mean R0 is notably lower, but this was based on a similar estimated growth rate of 0.275, suggesting the difference can be attributed to different assumptions about the serial interval.

Our simulations suggest that such changes could bias estimates of R0 and Rt, but would not be reflected in the percent of individuals testing positive over time. Individual-level data on the date of symptom onset, date of testing, and date of reporting are needed to resolve this potential bias. Estimates of Rt are also expected to lag behind true changes in the transmission rate due to reporting delays. Now-casting approaches may be useful for resolving this by inferring the number of infections occurring on each day based on the observed cases, hospitalizations and deaths, and known reporting delays (21). Imminent decisions regarding the lifting of stay-at-home orders and loosening social distancing requirements, and when such measures may need to be reinstated, depend on having a good understanding of current levels of transmission. Reliable estimates of the reproductive number are essential for quantifying the impact of control measures on transmission and making informed decisions about future interventions, e.g. (7, 19, 20, 22, 23) . However, changes in testing policies and practices, as well as delays in the reporting process, can lead to bias in estimates of the reproductive number, as we have demonstrated.

We assumed everyone else was susceptible at the start of the epidemic. New infections were assumed to arise according to a Poisson process (approximate method); the state transitions and rates are described in Table 1 , and model parameters are given in Table 2 . We simulated the model to day 70 using a time-step of \uf044t=0.05 days, and assumed a decrease in the transmission rate occurring on day 50, consistent with the impact of social distancing interventions. Models were run using MATLAB v9.3 (MathWorks, Natick, MA); code is available from https://github.com/vepitzer/COVIDtestingbias. We tracked the number of \"true cases\" on day d (Yd) as the number of individuals entering the infectious period each day. We assumed that each true case occurring on day d had a probability ptest(d) of being tested, and that for every true case that occurred on day d, there were ntest(d) individuals with similar symptoms who were tested. Furthermore, we assumed that testing and reporting of positive tests occurred with some delay \uf072d(t), which followed a gamma distribution with parameters ad and bd.
