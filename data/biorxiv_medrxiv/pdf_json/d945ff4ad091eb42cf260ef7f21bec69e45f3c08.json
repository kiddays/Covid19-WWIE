We show that statewide stay-at-home orders had the strongest causal impact on reducing social interactions. In contrast, most of the expected impact of more lenient policies were already reaped from nonpolicy mechanisms. Moreover, stay-at-home policy results in a steady decline in confirmed cases, starting from ten days after implementation and reaching a 37% decrease after fifteen days, consistent with the testing practices and incubation period of the disease.",

However, the relative impact of social awareness versus policy interventions is yet to be determined for the existing outbreak. In addition, several complementary policies were adopted to increase social distancing, some of which might have had unintended consequences. Therefore, identifying the most effective policies could help policymakers respond efficiently to the outbreak. Decoupling these factors is often challenging since, in most countries, the timing and strength of NPIs are highly correlated with public awareness. Moreover, it is crucial to determine which interventions have a significant impact on lowering the contact rate beyond what can be achieved via awareness mechanisms. Overall, the evaluation of these policies could provide valuable lessons, especially for the states that have not yet adopted NPIs.",

As of this writing, the US federal government has left NPI decisions to individual states, creating a high level of variation in the type and timing of such policies (Adolph et al., 2020) (Figure 1 ). While there is strong evidence for reduced social contact in the US, not all of these reductions can be attributed to NPIs: mobility data show that people in most states had already started to reduce the time they spend outside their homes before any NPI was implemented (Figure 2 ). In fact, for some states such as Idaho, Missouri, Wyoming, and the District of Columbia, people's presence at home had already increased close to a level of saturation before any social distancing policy went into effect. These trends suggest that attributing current reductions in social interaction to policy measures can be misleading, and they further underscore the need for a formal study to disentangle the direct impact of NPIs from other factors such as awareness and spillover effects.",

We first use Google-released daily human mobility indicators for different categories of places, such as residential areas, grocery stores and pharmacies, parks, retail stores and recreation sites, transit stations, and workplaces. The studied intervention policies were each employed in a subgroup of the US states and at different times during March 2020, making them suitable for quasi-experimental methods. We employ a linear regression model and a difference-in-differences approach, which, interestingly, was first developed in a simple form by John Snow in 1849 (Snow, 1855) to study the cause of the Cholera outbreak in London, and it resulted in policy adoptions that effectively ended the outbreak.",

At this stage, where changes in behavior are driven by a combination of policy forces and voluntary actions, our results help us rank NPIs based on the strength and significance of their impact, beyond what had already been achieved through voluntary actions. Specifically, our results show that the tendency to remain at home is driven strongly by statewide stay-at-home orders and moderately by non-essential business closures and policies related to restaurant and bar limits. Other policies such as school closure mandates, large gathering bans, and more limited stay-at-home orders do not show any significant impact on keeping people at home. Furthermore, statewide stay-at-home orders have a strong and significant impact on reducing mobility in all outsidehome place categories. The effectiveness of non-essential business closures and restaurant/bar limits are also significant on most (but not all) place categories. Limited stay-at-home orders and large gathering bans do not show any impact on increasing presence at home or reducing mobility in other place categories. If anything, in the absence of other policies, large gathering bans result in a moderate increase in mobility at transit stations. School closure mandates give us a mixed picture, with no significant impact on presence at home and a moderate, but significant, impact on mobility in retail locations and transit stations.",

We had data on all 50 states and the District of Columbia for 43 days, providing 2193 observations. The primary source for these data is state public health officials. We were aware of minor delays in reporting the number of tests and confirmed cases by states. However, this is an unprecedented and urgent public health issue, and we are only beginning to learn about various aspects of this phenomenon. Therefore, studies such as ours, which can demonstrate the effect of COVID-19 policies, are incredibly valuable for helping policymakers in evaluating alternative scenarios. Table 4 presents the summary statistics for the total COVID-19 tests performed and the number of confirmed cases. On average, between March 9 and April 20, 2020, 26,600 tests were done in each state on a daily basis out of which 351 cased were reported positive.",

The effects of other stay-at-home orders and nonessential business closures are noisy. Large gathering bans illustrate flat trends before and after the implementation, suggesting that this policy is ineffective in changing individuals' behavior in terms of staying at home.

This problem can be in part mitigated by analyzing the policy effects on the number of COVID-19 deaths. Given that the median time from infection to death is reported to be close to 17 days, and since many states have issued their strongest policies in the last week of March, that study needs to wait until enough reliable data are collected.",
