            "text": "Early detection of infection with SARS-CoV-2 is key to managing the current global pandemic, as evidence shows the virus is most contagious on or before symptom onset 1,2 . Here, we introduce a low-cost, high-throughput method for diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection, dubbed Pathogen-Oriented Low-Cost Assembly & Re-Sequencing (POLAR), that enhances sensitivity by aiming to amplify the entire SARS-CoV-2 genome rather than targeting particular viral loci, as in typical RT-PCR assays. To achieve this goal, we combine a SARS-CoV-2 enrichment method developed by the ARTIC Network (https://artic.network/) with short-read DNA sequencing and de novo genome assembly. We are able to reliably (>95% accuracy) detect SARS-CoV-2 at concentrations of 84 genome equivalents per milliliter, better than the reported limits of detection of almost all diagnostic methods currently approved by the US Food and Drug Administration. At higher concentrations, we are able to reliably assemble the SARS-CoV-2 genome in the sample, often with no gaps and perfect accuracy. Such genome assemblies enable the spread of the disease to be analyzed much more effectively than would be possible with an ordinary yes/no diagnostic, and can help identify vaccine and drug targets. Using POLAR, a single person can process 192 samples over the course of an 8-hour experiment, at a cost of ~$30/patient, enabling a 24-hour turnaround with sequencing and data analysis time included. Further testing and refinement will likely enable greater enhancements in the sensitivity of the above approach.",

Although RT-PCR reactions can be extraordinarily specific, they suffer from key limitations. First, since RT-PCR assays amplify specific target loci, the assays will report a negative result if the particular target locus is not present in the sample. Consequently, RT-PCR will often produce an incorrect result when the sample is positive, but contains less than one genome equivalent in the initial reaction volume. Second, RT-PCR does not provide any genotypic information about a patient's infection beyond the causal organism. Such data can provide insight into the specific infecting strain and aid in tracing transmission within communities. Furthermore, the capacity to quickly and efficiently generate new viral genome data could expedite the generation of new diagnostics, vaccines and precise antivirals.",

Notably, the SARS-CoV-2 genome is free of repeats, making it susceptible to complete characterization using short DNA reads.",

We show that POLAR is a reliable, inexpensive, and high-throughput SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic. Specifically, POLAR makes it possible for a single person to process 192 patient samples in an 8-hour workday day at a cost of $31 per sample. Including time for sequencing and data analysis, POLAR still enables a 24-hour turnaround time. POLAR also achieves very high sensitivity, with a limit of detection of 84 genome equivalents per milliliter, outperforming nearly all diagnostic tests currently approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA).",

For each library, we generated a de novo assembly using the memory efficient assembly algorithm MEGAHIT 51 with default parameters. We first assessed the accuracy of these de novo assemblies by comparing them to the SARS-CoV-2 reference genome using a rescaled genome dot plot ( Figure 3 ). The de novo assemblies showed very good correspondence with the SARS-CoV-2 reference, including the samples that contained only 84 genome equivalents per milliliter. We then quantified the accuracy and quality of these de novo SARS-CoV-2 assemblies. For the de novo assemblies that contained \u22658,400 equivalents per milliliter, 86.67% of assemblies consisted of a singular contig comprising 99.77% of the SARS-CoV-2 genome ( Table 1 ). The remaining 0.23% of the SARS-CoV-2 genome corresponds to short regions at both ends of the genome, which are not amplified by the ARTIC primer set. While the de novo assemblies created from samples with 840 genome equivalents/mL and 84 genome equivalents/mL are less contiguous, we are able to recover on average 84.63% and 34.16% of the viral genome, respectively. Remarkably, 100% of the bases in 16 of these 20 de novo assemblies match the corresponding bases in the SARS-CoV-2 reference genome. Three of the remaining four de novo assemblies have only a single base pair difference as compared to the SARS-CoV-2 reference genome. Collectively, these data demonstrate that our method provides de novo SARS-CoV-2 genome assemblies at viral concentrations at or below the CDC RT-PCR limit of detection. Furthermore, at most of the concentrations examined, the SARS-CoV-2 genome assemblies produced by POLAR are gapless, and completely free of errors.",

Most of these approaches partition individual samples into multiple wells, making them difficult to perform in a highly multiplex fashion 63, 64 . One method enables extensive multiplexing, but does not include a random fragmentation step. As such, it requires 2 x 150bp paired-end reads in order to produce gapless assemblies, making a 24-hour turnaround impossible on extant Illumina devices 65 . Because POLAR includes a random fragmentation step requiring only 75bp reads, it can be performed on more rapid instruments such as NextSeq 550. However, at least one of these methods appears to enable both rapid turnaround and 9-fold multiplexing 62 . Although prior studies have not explored sensitivity and specificity of these protocols when deployed as a diagnostic, emerging work from many laboratories make it clear that whole-genome sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 is likely to be a promising modality that is well-suited for clinical use.",

Each dilution was tested with two biological replicates each of which further had 10 technical replicates, so in total 20 replicates from each dilution of stock SARS-CoV-2 gRNA. For experiment,1\u00b5l of each dilution was spiked into a mix of 4.5\u00b5l of nuclease-free water, 0.5\u00b5l of 10mM dNTPs Mix (NEB, N0447L) and 0.5 \u00b5l of 50\u00b5M Random Hexamers (ThermoFisher, N8080127) to serve as the starting material, \"RNA Extract\", for the protocol. The RNA, hexamers, and dNTPs mixture was incubated at 65\u00b0C for 5 minutes followed by a 1 minute incubation at 4\u00b0C in order to anneal hexamers to RNA. In order to reverse transcribe RNA into cDNA, we added 2\u00b5l of 5X SuperScript\u2122 IV Reverse Buffer (ThermoFisher, 18090050), 0.5\u00b5l of SuperScript\u2122 IV Reverse Transcriptase (200 U/\u00b5L) (ThermoFisher, 18090050), 0.5\u00b5l of 100mM DTT (ThermoFisher, 18090050), 0.5\u00b5l of RNaseOUT Recombinant Ribonuclease Inhibitor (ThermoFisher, 10777-019) to the hexamer annealed RNA. The reaction was then incubated at 42\u00b0C for 50 minutes followed by an incubation at 70\u00b0C for 10 minutes before holding at 4\u00b0C. For amplification of cDNA, we used SARS-CoV-2-specific version 3 primer set (total 218 primers) designed by Josh Quick from the ARTIC Network. Primers were purchased at LabReady concentration of 100\u00b5M in IDTE buffer (pH 8.0) from Integrated DNA Technologies (IDT). Multiplex-polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was performed in two separate reaction mixes prepared by combining 5\u00b5l of 5X Q5 Reaction Buffer (NEB, M0493S), 0.5\u00b5l of 10 mM dNTPs (NEB, N0447L), 0.25\u00b5l Q5 Hot Start DNA Polymerase (NEB, M0493S)with either 12.7\u00b5l Nuclease-free water (Qiagen, 129114) and 4.05\u00b5l of 10\u00b5M \"Primer Pool #1\" or, 12.77\u00b5l Nuclease-free water (Qiagen, 129114) and 3.98uL for 10\u00b5M \"Primer Pool #2\". The final concentration of each primer in the reaction mix was 0.015\u00b5M in the PCR mix. 22.5\u00b5l of the corresponding mastermix (Pool #1 or Pool #2) was combined with 2.5\u00b5l of the reverse transcribed cDNA. The reaction was then incubated at 98\u00b0C for 30 seconds for 1 cycle followed by 25 cycles at 98\u00b0C for 15 seconds and 65\u00b0C for 5 minutes before holding at 4\u00b0C. Pool #1 or Pool #2 amplicons from each replicate were then mixed together and cleaned by adding 1:1 volume of sparQ PureMag beads (QuantaBio, 95196-060) and incubating at room temperature for 5 minutes. The beads were separated using a magnet and the supernatant was discarded, followed by two 200\u00b5l washes of freshly made 80% ethanol. Each sample was eluted in 11\u00b5l of 10mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) and incubated for 2 minutes at 37\u00b0C followed by separation on a magnet. The DNA was then quantified using a Qubit\u00ae High Sensitivity Kit (ThermoFisher, Q32851) as per manufacturer's instructions and the concentrations were used to ensure 1ng of amplicon DNA in 4\u00b5l was carried per sample into library preparation. Temperature was then lowered to 10\u00b0C followed by addition of 2.5\u00b5l of Neutralize Tagment Buffer immediately after the cooling started, mixed by pipetting, and incubated at room temperature for 5 minutes. After 5 minutes, the reaction was centrifuged at 280xG for 1 minute and the next reaction was set-up during centrifugation. 12.5\u00b5l of a mastermix containing 7. The reaction was then incubated on a thermal cycler with the following parameters: 1 cycle at 72\u00b0C for 3 minutes and 95\u00b0C for 30 seconds, 18 cycles at 55\u00b0C for 10 seconds, 72\u00b0C for 30 seconds, 72\u00b0C for 5 minutes followed by a 4\u00b0C hold. Post PCR clean up was done using 1:1.8 volume (45\u00b5L beads in 25uL reaction) of sparQ PureMag beads (QuantaBio, 95196-060), washed twice with 80% ethanol, eluted in 20\u00b5L of 10mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) followed by an incubation at 37\u00b0C for 2 minutes and separated on a magnetic plate. 10\u00b5l from each well of the plate was then transferred onto the corresponding well on a new midi plate. A Library Normalization (LN) (Illumina, FC-131-1096) master mix was created by combining two reagents in a 15\u00b5l conical tube. The reagents were multiplied by the number of samples being processed: 23\u00b5l of LNA1 and 4\u00b5l of LNB1. The mixture was then mixed by pipetting 10 times and then poured into a trough. Using a p200 multichannel pipette, 22.5\u00b5l of LN master mix was placed into each sample well. To mix, we sealed the plate, and vortexed using a plate shaker at 1800rpm for 30 minutes. The plate was then placed on a magnetic stand to separate the beads. Once the liquid on the plate was clear, without disturbing the beads, we discarded the supernatant. The beads were then washed twice by adding 22.5\u00b5l of LNW1 to each well, sealing the plate, using the plate shaker at 1800rpm for 5 minutes, then separating the beads on a magnetic plate and discarding the supernatant. After the washes, 15\u00b5l of 0.1N NaOH was added to each well. The plate was then sealed and vortexed at 1800rpm to mix the sample for 5 minutes. During the 5minute mixing, 15\u00b5l of LNS1 was added to each well of a new 96-well PCR plate that was labeled as SGP. After the 5-minute elution step, the plate was placed on a magnetic stand, and 15\u00b5l of the supernatant was transferred to the corresponding well of the SGP plate. The plate was then sealed and spun at 1000xG for 1 minute.",

(B & C) Each report includes a genome dot plot of the de novo assembly against the SARS-CoV-2 reference genome, with a coverage track of sequenced reads aligned to the SARS-CoV-2 reference genome above the dot plot. The report also includes the breadth of coverage of sequenced reads aligned to 17 different coronaviruses. The diagnostic answer is given in the form of a \"+\" or \"-\" symbol and \"Positive\" or \"Negative\" for SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus in the top right corner of the report.",
