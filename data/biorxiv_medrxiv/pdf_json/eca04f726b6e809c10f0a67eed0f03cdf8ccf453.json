In this paper, we propose an extension of the epidemiological SEIR model to enable a detailed analysis of commonly discussed tailored measures of epidemic control-among them group-specific protection and the use of tracing apps. We introduce groups into the SEIR model that may differ both, in their underlying parameters as well as in their behavioral response to public health interventions. We allow for different infectiousness parameters within and across groups, different asymptomatic, hospitalization, and lethality rates, as well as different take-up rates of tracing apps. Our results visualize the sharp trade-offs between different goals of epidemic control, namely a low death toll, avoiding overload of the health system, and a short duration of the epidemic. We show that a combination of tailored mechanisms, e.g., the protection of vulnerable groups together with a \"trace & isolate\" approach, can be effective in preventing a high death toll. Protection of vulnerable groups without further measures requires unrealistically strict isolation. A key insight is that high compliance is critical for the effectiveness of a \"trace & isolate\" approach. Our model allows to analyze the interplay of group-specific social distancing and tracing also beyond our case study in scenarios with a large number of groups reflecting, e.g., sectoral, regional, or age differentiation and group-specific take-up rates for tracing apps.",

Since February 2020 many nations around the world have locked down significant parts of their social and economic activities to slow down infection rates. The main goal not to overburden the health system has been achieved with varying degrees of success across countries. In the meantime, the implemented \"social distancing\" measures are effective in slowing down infection rates. Doubling times of the infected have increased from three to between thirteen to thirty days in many European countries.

The lockdown bought the governments time to design a medium-run approach that maintains the same level of health protection while allowing to increase economic and social activities. Tailored packages of measures can include (i) protection of risk groups, (ii) suppression of the spread of the virus by legal requirements on obligatory protective measures, (iii) suppression of the transmission of the virus by maintaining certain social distancing requirements, (iv) regionally differentiated restarts of social and economic activities, and finally, (v) the improvement of digitalization in the health sector and the use of tracing apps and isolation of potentially infected individuals.",

In this paper, we thus propose an extension of the epidemiological SEIR model to enable the analysis of commonly discussed measures of epidemic control in more detail. We introduce different groups that may differ both in their underlying parameters as well as in their behavioral response to public health interventions. In particular, we allow the infectiousness parameters to differ within and across groups, which enables the detailed analysis of group-specific measures. Moreover, groups may have different asymptomatic, hospitalization, and lethality rates. Within this framework, we are able to analyze social distancing measures within groups, specific protection of groups with high lethality rates, as well as the detailed effects of \"trace & isolate\" strategies with different levels of take-up of the tracing apps needed in this context.",

We have to mention at this point that available data are mostly preliminary and likely to not be representative. This is due to the fact that in the beginning of the pandemic, test capacities were scarce-which they still are-and therefore none of the parameters originates from controlled random trials. As time goes by, this situation will change. The model can easily be applied to new and more reliable data sets as well as richer scenarios with, e.g., a larger number of groups and case studies can be updated as new data become available. On the other hand, our model and results also provide guidance on which parameters are key to be identified reliably in order to analyze the effectiveness of epidemic control approaches in more detail.",

Our results highlight the sharp trade-off between different goals of epidemic control, namely keeping the death toll as low as possible, limiting the duration of the epidemic, i.e., the time until \"enough\" immunity exists in the population, and managing intensive care unit (ICU) capacity. We further show that protection of vulnerable groups is effective even if it is applied in a mild form as long as it is implemented in combination with tracing. If tracing is not used together with protection of vulnerable groups, only strict isolation of those groups can effectively prevent a high death toll. Such very strict isolation may be socially undesirable. We also show that compliance is very important for the effectiveness of a \"trace & isolate\" approach. Tracing is almost completely ineffective unless compliance is high, which in our case study means at least 70 % of the population install and use tracing apps effectively. Crucially, the \"critical\" compliance rate can be brought down substantially when vulnerable groups are protected.",

Our model can be used to study such group-specific measures flexibly for any partition of the population and we re-iterate that any policy conclusions should continually be revised as new and improved data become available. It is also important to note that data protection aspects in connection with tracing apps must be carefully considered, especially as we have seen that high compliance is absolutely essential. Last, extensive digitalization of the health care and the registration system is an indispensable prerequisite for the effective use of of a \"trace & isolate\" approach.

A number of papers have studied public health interventions within the SIR/SEIR models. Most of them focused on social distancing [13, 20, 21] . In general, social distancing is found to be very effective in suppressing the disease in the short run in these models including age-structured and location-specific models [21, 23] . Other interventions have been studied less and, if so, in unstructured models assuming a homogeneous population [7] . Among those, testing and quarantining is seen as a promising tool to control the epidemic [2] , though there is widespread awareness of the difficulty of implementing these measures with limited testing capacity and a potentially high asymptomatic rate [17] . Because of this, contact tracing is considered key, but thought to be difficult for COVID-19 and other Corona viruses; see, e.g., [7, 8] . Recent research argues that viral spread is too fast for manual contact tracing in the case of COVID-19 and emphasizes that compliance is critical for the effectiveness of contact-tracing apps [7] . One of the contributions of our research is to model the behavioral response, specifically concerning compliance with respect to the use of tracing apps and self-isolation. Our model can furthermore capture sectoral or regional heterogeneity in underlying parameters and infection rates. These properties are also interesting with regard to integration into macroeconomic models, which, for example, are investigated in [4] or [14] .",

Thus, it holds (S(t) + E(t) + I(t) + R(t))N = N , where N is the total population size. Note that the group of recovered people also contains deaths in this model. The basic reproduction number is R 0 = \u03b2/\u03b3, which can be thought of as the expected number of cases generated by one case in the model. Table 1 summarizes the notation for the SEIR model. (1) is now extended to distinguish (i) between different groups such as old and young people, or vulnerable and non-vulnerable individuals, (ii) between different categories of infectiousness (asymptomatic, symptomatic, and severe cases), and (iii) between recovered and dead people. Being able to explicitly distinguish these different groups is important as they can greatly differ in terms of their underlying parameters as well as in terms of their behavioral response to public health interventions. First, we consider different groups k \u2208 {1, . . . , K}. The total number of individuals in group k is denoted with N k . Groups may differ in multiple characteristics such as age, gender, location, profession, immunity status, etc. The compartments S, E, I, and R are thus split up into S k , E k , I k , and R k for all k. In our analysis, we also capture specific aspects that are needed to analyze a variety of strategies to slow down an epidemic. We explicitly capture that, across groups, different fractions of infectious individuals show symptoms of the infection. We denote the fraction (of I k ) of asymptomatic individuals I asym k in group k by \u03b7 k \u2208 (0, 1). Thus, 1 \u2212 \u03b7 k is the fraction of infectious individuals that are symptomatic. Among those symptomatic individuals, a fraction \u03bd k \u2208 (0, 1) suffers a severe course of the disease and is assumed to need intensive care unit (ICU) treatment, while a fraction (1 \u2212 \u03bd k ) is symptomatic without the need for intensive care.

In the following, we extend the SEI 3 RD model to be able to analyze a policy to reduce the number of infected individuals by the widespread introduction of tracing apps. These apps allow to break infection chains by sending infected individuals to quarantine (Q) before they can spread the virus further. Here, we assume that a fraction \u03c8 k of individuals in group k uses such a tracing app effectively. An infection chain can be broken if both, the carrier and the recipient of the virus, use a tracing app \"effectively\", meaning that the recipient of the virus can be sent to quarantine before he or she is infectious (i.e., enters one of the groups in compartment I). 3 We model the impact of tracing by splitting the compartment E consisting of individuals in the incubation period. In particular, we assume that, as a spreader of the virus, only individuals that are aware of their infection (symptomatic or severely infectious) can be recognized by the health authorities and can contribute to break infection chains if they use the app effectively. This applies to a fraction \u03c8 k of group k. All their contacts who also use the app (fraction \u03c8 ) will be identified. Thus, when individuals from groups k and meet, then \u03c8 k \u03c8 of the infected individuals are \"traced\" and enter E tr k , while the remaining infected individuals are \"not traced\" and enter E nt k . We model the fact that infected individuals who are identified through contact tracing are sent into quarantine by splitting the group of infectious individuals further into I and Q. All individuals from E tr k enter compartments Q when they become infectious while all individuals from E nt k enter compartments I. 2 A different rationing mechanism might be interesting to look at if one is interested in the age structure of the dead or if one wants to analyze the effect of different triage mechanisms that imply preferential treatment, e.g., for young people. Those extensions are easily possible by modifying of Equation (3). 3 This obviously depends on individual compliance in downloading and using the app but it may also depend on the effectiveness of the health system to contact potentially infected people and send them into quarantine, i.e., on the speed of notification etc. Also note that the fraction of the population that uses tracing apps may vary across groups due to acceptance, ability, or availability of a smart phone.",

In our parameterization, the vulnerable group is characterized by having a higher conditional probability of a severe course of the disease (modeled using the parameter \u03bd) and a higher conditional lethality rate among ICU patients (parameter\u03c3). Protection policies for such vulnerable groups are particularly focused on keeping all \u03b2's low that involve this group. Interactions within the less vulnerable group can be less restricted. One question we will ask is how much one can allow \u03b2 LL , which measures transmission within the low vulnerability group, to increase while at the same time not having to lower the remaining \u03b2's too much and still achieve the same effect on overall lethality as under uniform social distancing.",

The app continuously registers contact persons that an individual comes close to in the context of interactions. Once an individual is tested positively for COVID-19, the individual is free to give the health administration permission to use this data to contact all individuals that have potentially been infected. We assume that all individuals that use the app also agree to the use of their data and that the health office's procedures are fast enough to actually break the infection chain for all individuals that use the app. This means, in particular, that potentially infected individuals are effectively isolated, i.e., sent to self-quarantine until a test can verify their infection status as positive or negative.

Those mechanisms are important in general to combine effective health protection with social and economic activities. The exact design of the mechanisms will of course depend on the specific situation at hand. A consideration of specific scenarios, with potentially more groups and more accurate parameters is not the focus of this paper, but a possible application of the model.

            "text": "This section contains the results and discussion of our simulation outcomes. In order to first draw the bigger picture, we present two selected scenarios that illustrate extreme cases, the scenarios B2 and USD2 (see Table 4 ). Scenario B2 represents a situation without any measures of epidemic control and a reproduction rate R \u2248 2.6. Scenario USD2 assumes thorough social distancing leading to an effective reproduction rate R \u2248 1. 4 The course of the epidemic in the two scenarios is presented in Figure 1 (with days on the x-axis and number of individuals on the y-axis). Note that for both scenarios we show group-specific outcomes for a group with high vulnerability (H) and a group with low vulnerability (L). Here and in what follows, we define the duration of the epidemic as the number of days until the number of severe cases is below 5 % of ICU capacity and where at the same time the share of the population in the susceptible category is below 1/R 0 . Figure 1 . Dynamics of the COVID-19 epidemic for the B2 (left) and the USD2 (right) scenario: Susceptible individuals in green, recovered in blue, and aggregated asymptomatic, symptomatic, and severe infectious cases in orange. The group with low vulnerability has dotted curves, the group with high vulnerability is plotted solidly. Figure 1 (left) illustrates that without any intervention, the epidemic is quickly over but claims many lives. In particular, due to the rapid exponential spread of the epidemic in scenario B2, about 80 % of the population has gone through the infection after only 247 days. At this point, only about 20 % of the population remain susceptible, which corresponds to herd immunity. 6 Due to the fact that the 4 As in our model asymptomatically, symptomatically and severely infectious can have different recovery rates, R changes over time as the relative frequency of these groups in the population changes. This is why the values of R we indicate are only approximations. 5 To achieve herd immunity, one needs a share of around 1 \u2212 1/R 0 percent of the population to be immune. For a value of R 0 = 3 this corresponds to two thirds of the population. For lower values of R 0 , this share is lower. 6 One of the many parameters that is not yet fully clear for this disease is how long immunity lasts once someone has been exposed. We assume here that exposed individuals remain immune for 500 days at least. If this is not the case, i.e., if immunity is shorter, then the share of susceptible individuals after 500 days will be larger. Hence, the percentage of susceptible individuals we report in the tables are always lower bounds.",

In our simulations ICU capacity would be exceeded for between three and five months and the death toll would be anywhere between 240 000 to over half a million lives. Because of these and similar results we have seen social distancing implemented all over Europe in the last few months. Against this background, the next section addresses various social distancing scenarios. 4.2. Uniform Social Distancing. As a second benchmark we consider three uniform social distancing scenarios. Uniform social distancing means that all interactions in the population are reduced to the same extent. Among our three scenarios, USD1 represents a case of mild social distancing with an average effective reproduction number of R \u2248 1.5.

Scenario USD2 has an R \u2248 1, i.e., also here the disease is progressing, but more slowly. Scenario USD3 suppresses the disease with R \u2248 0.6, which is at the lower end of the estimates of the effective reproductive number during the recent/current lockdowns in Europe. Under mild social distancing (USD1) the epidemic progresses slowly. ICU capacity is slightly exceeded over a period of at most three weeks, but there is still a death toll of 120 000 in the first 500 days. After 500 days a large share of the population is still susceptible and, moreover, it is unknown, given current evidence, whether those who passed through the illness early on are still immune after 500 days. In USD2 and USD3, social distancing is effective to suppress the epidemic with the effect that the number of deaths in the first 500 days is comparatively low. However, in these scenarios the vast majority of the population (up to 99 %) is still susceptible after 500 days. Hence, especially in USD2 and USD3, the death toll will further increase after 500 days until a vaccine is widely available. 7 Suppression is not a long term strategy and, in the absence of an effective vaccine, alternatives need to be considered. This is what we focus on in the next two sections.",

We hence split the population in the 20 % most vulnerable and the rest of the population. 8 The scenarios we discuss here build on our benchmark scenarios B2 and B3. We then either reduce only contact rates for interactions that affect individuals with high vulnerability (H) or reduce all contact rates but at different rates. The first approach corresponds to a strategy to resume live as usual except for the vulnerable, who are then severely protected. The second approach corresponds to the establishment of general protection measures also in daily live, with particular protective measures applied to vulnerable individuals. GSD1 builds on benchmark B2, but then drastically reduces all interactions involving highly vulnerable individuals, 7 Note also that all our uniform social distancing scenarios are based on benchmark B3, which assumes a higher asymptomatic rate among the group with low vulnerability. In the case of a lower asymptomatic rate (comparison to B2), there are more deaths in the first 500 days. Other than that the results are very similar. 8 The 20 % most vulnerable individuals are those most likely to have a severe course of the disease. It has been shown that mostly age, but also gender and certain health conditions, are strong predictors of the severity of COVID-19. Of course, it is also possible to split the population in other ways and, e.g., to protect the most vulnerable 25 or 30 %.",

This roughly corresponds to an effective reproduction number of R \u2248 0.6 generated from these interactions only. GSD2 also restricts all interactions involving the highly vulnerable population to \u03b2 = 0.04 but corresponds to B3 in all other parameters, i.e., in particular assumes a lower contact rate \u03b2 LL from interactions among the less vulnerable. GSD3 is a scenario where both groups engage in social distancing but to a different extent, with LL-interactions restricted to \u03b2 LL = 0.11 and all other interactions restricted to \u03b2 HH = \u03b2 LH = \u03b2 HL = 0.04. Otherwise, the parameters in GSD3 are identical to GSD2 and B3. Table 7 reports the results for these three scenarios. Compared to the benchmark scenario B2, GSD1 manages to reduce the death toll by about 70 %, merely by shielding vulnerable people (and leaving LL-interactions unrestricted). However, despite the extreme protection of vulnerable people in this scenario, ICU capacity is exceeded for 129 days and the death toll is still high (around 160 000 deaths). If the interactions involving the less vulnerable (LL) have somewhat lower contact rates (as in GSD2), we observe a lower death toll and ICU capacity is exceeded on fewer days (around 55 days). Still there are 75 000 deaths (which is about an 85 % reduction compared to scenario B2 in which vulnerable people are not protected).",

This is due to the fact that vulnerable individuals are less restricted and, thus, those who have a higher probability to suffer a severe course of infection and to eventually pass away will incur relatively more infections. Moreover, since interactions among less vulnerable individuals are more restricted, a larger share of the population is still susceptible after 500 days. Compared to scenario USD1, where uniform social distancing is applied in a mild form and all interactions imply an effective reproduction number of about R = 1.5, the death toll in scenario GSD3 is reduced by 50 000 (approx. 40 %) and ICU capacity is not exceeded, while it is exceeded on 11-21 days in scenario USD1. Hence, protection of vulnerable groups in addition to mild social distancing measures for the rest of the population can be effective to some extent. The results of scenarios GSD1 and GSD2 show, on the contrary, that protection of the vulnerable population alone is not sufficient to adequately cope with the epidemic (i.e., reduce the death toll to a bearable level and protect the health system), even if measures to protect the vulnerable population are quite extreme.",

The death toll is significantly reduced compared to the respective scenarios without tracing if compliance is high, but not if it is low. Interestingly, if only the group with low vulnerability has a high take-up rate, and social distancing is in place, the death toll is close to the death toll under generally high compliance if group-specific social distancing is in place. The numbers also show that even if compliance is low, tracing is able to shave off some of the peak demand for ICU beds. In scenario USD1-Trace, this means that we manage to stay within ICU capacity with tracing but not without (in the GSD3-Trace scenarios, ICU capacity is sufficient already without tracing). 11 9 Recall that this scenario uses a low asymptomatic rate. The asymptomatic rate is key for tracing and if it is increased to 50 % only for the L group, then there are around 132 000 deaths in this case. 10 As the epidemic progresses more slowly in this case, ICU capacity is exceeded for more days compared to the case where both groups show low compliance.

In particular, we allow the infectiousness parameters to differ within and across groups. Moreover, groups may have different asymptomatic, hospitalization, and lethality rates. Within this framework, we are able to analyze social distancing measures that differentiate across groups, specific protection of groups with high lethality rates, as well as the detailed effects of \"trace & isolate\" strategies with different levels of take-up of the tracing apps needed. We moreover shed light on the attractiveness to combine these measures.",

            "text": "Our results highlight sharp trade-offs between different goals of epidemic control and also illustrate how tailored social distancing and protection measures could be effectively combined with a \"trace & isolate\" approach to keep severe infections within the capacity of the health system and the death toll low. However, our analysis also clearly illustrates the well known downside of rigorous epidemic control: The duration of the epidemic is extended far into the future, making it necessary to continue rigorous control measures for possibly very long time-spans until a vaccine becomes widely available. On the positive side, we illustrate that mild social distancing in combination with a \"trace & isolate\" approach could be a promising way to control the epidemic in the medium run. This is, however, only true if take-up rates for the apps are high enough within those groups in which social distancing is loosened. This is an unlikely scenario in everyday life, however, it could well create opportunities to open businesses under the condition that tracing is made mandatory. This could definitely apply to industrial production and the services industry, and may also be a temporary regime in education. From a practical perspective, the speed of infection control will also be crucial for effectiveness. In our model we assume that infection chains are broken whenever the infectious and the infected individual use an app. This, however, is only true if the health system operates fast enough to isolate the infected individual within the incubation period.",

This is due to the fact that in the beginning of the pandemic, test capacities were scarce-which they still are-and therefore none of the parameters originates from controlled random trials. As time goes bye, this situation will change. The main contribution of our paper, the extension of the SEIR model to SEI 3 Q 3 RD, can easily be applied to new and more reliable data sets. Our model and results also provide guidance to which parameters are key to be identified reliably in order to analyze the effectiveness of epidemic control approaches in more detail.",
