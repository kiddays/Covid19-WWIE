Due to the economic impacts of social distancing, there is growing desire to relax these measures. To characterize a range of possible strategies for control and to understand their consequences, we performed an optimal control analysis of a mathematical model of SARS-CoV-2 transmission. Given that the pandemic is already underway and controls have already been initiated, we calibrated our model to data from the US and focused our analysis on optimal controls from May 2020 through December 2021. We found that a major factor that differentiates strategies that prioritize lives saved versus reduced time under control is how quickly control is relaxed once social distancing restrictions expire in May 2020. Strategies that maintain control at a high level until summer 2020 allow for tapering of control thereafter and minimal deaths, whereas strategies that relax control in the short term lead to fewer options for control later and a higher likelihood of exceeding hospital capacity. Our results also highlight that the potential scope for controlling COVID-19 until a vaccine is available depends on epidemiological parameters about which there is still considerable uncertainty, including the basic reproduction number and the effectiveness of social distancing. In light of those uncertainties, our results do not constitute a quantitative forecast and instead provide a qualitative portrayal of possible outcomes from alternative approaches to control.",

This parameter, often denoted \u03b2, reflects the product of the rate of contact between susceptible and infectious people and the probability of transmission upon contact [24] . Due to the extent to which they reduce contact, full-scale lockdowns appear to be the most effective strategy for reducing transmission available at present [18] . Until alternative NPI-based strategies can be implemented that are similarly effective but less disruptive economically, it is urgently important to determine the minimal extent to which contact must be reduced to achieve public health objectives.",

An optimal strategy in this sense involves weighing the relative costs of control and COVID-related mortality, and finding an approach to control that minimizes that combined cost. Other optimal control analyses of COVID-19 are beginning to emerge [14, 31, 40, 43, 45] , although these have been less focused on any particular geographic setting. One contextual feature of the US that our analysis considers is the level of control that was implemented early in the pandemic. We account for this, because our objective is less about understanding what level of control would have been optimal earlier on and more about understanding what level of control would be optimal going forward, conditional on what has happened already. In addition, we emphasize the sensitivity of our results to epidemiological parameters that are not yet well characterized but appear influential in determining what range of impacts of NPIs on COVID-19 are possible.

Thus, a wide range of NPIs could result in changes in u, including school closures, work from home policies, and shelter in place mandates, as well as more targeted approaches, such as isolation based on self-awareness of symptoms or contact tracing. In addition to control through u, the V class represents individuals who have been vaccinated, with individuals entering V from S at rate \u03bd beginning on day \u03c4 \u03bd . We assume that vaccination may not provide complete protection, resulting in vaccinated individuals becoming infected at a fraction 1 \u2212 of the rate at which fully susceptible individuals become infected.",

In general, ours and other studies share the conclusion that heightened control early in the pandemic is important for achieving long-term success. Like our analysis, some anticipate that partial relaxation of controls may be possible over time [14, 45] , whereas others focus on strategies intended to have a more limited duration to begin with [40, 35, 43] . Importantly though, our analysis goes further than others in exploring sensitivity of the optimal control to model parameters. Specifically, we show that preventing a large wave that overwhelms health systems may not even be possible under some parameter combinations (low u max , high R 0 ) and that prioritizing the minimization of deaths versus days under control leads to vastly different outcomes. We also constrain levels of control applied through April 2020, making the optimization more relevant to future decision making. Shifting the timing of the initiation of control shows that constraints about past levels of control strongly affect future possibilities for the extent to which deaths can be minimized and the level of control required to achieve that, consistent with other results [27] .",

At least with respect to the possibility of different levels of control for different age groups, one study found that age-specific optimal controls were all relatively similar for NPIs against pandemic influenza [46] . Additional limitations that affect our model's suitability for making future predictions include its deterministic nature and the rudimentary calibration procedure that we performed, which was sufficient to provide a basis for qualitative analyses but that would need refinement for application of our model to inference or forecasting.",

At the same time, our analysis highlights the role that constraints play in determining optimal levels of control going forward, both in terms of constraints on epidemiological parameters and on levels of control prior to the time that a decision is made about future actions. Going forward, reducing transmission in the near term would give decision makers greater flexibility in the range of decisions available to them in the future, and gathering high-quality data could help reduce uncertainty about the consequences of those decisions.",
