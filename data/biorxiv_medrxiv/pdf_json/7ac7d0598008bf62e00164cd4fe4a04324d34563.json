Such information is critical to identify high risk patients and to facilitate planning (e.g., forecasting the need for hospital beds and mechanical ventilators).

However, other than age, results have been inconsistent. Furthermore, few studies that evaluated other potential risk factors accounted for potential confounding by age and sex. For example, some studies reported that hypertension is a risk factor of severe COVID-19, but their observations may simply reflect the fact that hypertension is more common in older adults. 3 Nonetheless, despite the lack of robust evidence, this observation, together with the fact SARS-CoV-2 uses angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 as an entry to human cell, 4 has raised a concern about continued use of reninangiotensin system increase among some clinicians and researchers. 5, 6 In this context, we conducted a systematic review of studies reporting cardiovascular risk factors and their relation to severe manifestation of COVID-19 (i.e., death, acute respiratory distress syndrome [ARDS] , the need of mechanical ventilator support, and admission to an intensive care unit [ICU]), with a particular interest on studies that adjusted for key confounders such as age and sex.",

In this process, when there was any cell with zero count, we added 0.5 to each cell, as appropriate. 10 Potential confounding by age and sex is relevant to prior CVD, hypertension, and diabetes, since these comorbidities become more prevalent with increased age. 3 Because most studies did not report adjusted risk estimates for these comorbidities, we conducted metaregression analyses with random-effects for log odds ratio or log hazard ratio for these comorbidities by the difference in mean or median age between those with vs. without primary outcome across eligible studies. To obtain reliable estimates, we required at least five studies for each meta-regression analysis. We also depicted funnel plots and visually checked the possibility of publication bias. Heterogeneity of study estimates was assessed by I 2 statistic, and I 2 >75% was considered high heterogeneity. 11 In our review, we found a total of 10 reports likely using the same data source even though they did not analyze identical samples. Since we could not be certain whether these were duplicate or overlapping publications, we had two approaches to conducting the metaanalyses: (1) a restrictive approach in which we excluded reports with high possibility of overlap [e.g., data from the same hospitals during the same period] and (2) an inclusive approach in which we included all publications. For the restrictive approach, we used the largest study with estimates of interest. To be conservative, we present the restrictive meta-analysis as our primary analysis. The results of the inclusive meta-analysis are available in the supplemental material. A p-value <0.05 was considered statistically significant. All analyses were conducted with Stata 14 or 15 (StataCorp, LLC, College Station, Texas, USA).",

None of the 25 studies in our systematic review explored these medications regarding severe COVID-19. Moreover, in the only study reporting the prevalence of renin-angiotensin system inhibitors use, 16 ~30% of patients reported prevalent hypertension, but only ~5% of patients were taking renin-angiotensin system inhibitors. 16 Thus, it is reasonable that many expert organizations recommend continuing this category of medications until better evidence becomes available. 4 Our results can potentially be used to guide decision-making. While the lack of discrete age thresholds for severe COVID-19 complicates this process, data on case fatality rates from three countries (Web Table 2 ) suggest that age older than 60 or 65 years confers high risk of severe COVID-19 (relative risk > ~5 compared to <50 years). Our results also indicate male sex is an independent risk factor with a pooled relative risk of ~1.7. Although the pooled crude relative risk of ~3-5 for hypertension, diabetes, and CVD probably overestimate their impact beyond age and sex, all or some of them are likely to each confer 1.5-2 times greater risk. Thus, using these factors, it is possible to estimate, at least crudely, the risk of severe COVID-19. For example, a man aged 60-65 years old, with either hypertension, diabetes, or prior CVD would have a risk of ~15 fold higher risk (approximation of 5 x 1.7 x 2) compared to a woman younger than 50 years without any of these clinical factors. Such information could be used to inform decisions on testing for COVID-19, clinical management of COVID-19, and workforce planning.",

Eight reviewers (N.D., M.K., Y.G., Y.H., Y.M., X.H., M.C., and J.I.) worked in pairs to independently screen titles and abstracts. For research letters without abstracts, reviewers used text content for the initial screening. All conflicts were resolved by one of two lead reviewers (N.D., M.K.). For all publications accepted at this step, the same pairs performed the full detailed text review to evaluate final eligibility. The two lead reviewers resolved any conflicts.",

The pooled estimate of relative risk for severe COVID-19 was ~1.8 in both restrictive and inclusive meta-analyses, although statistical significance was restricted to the latter. Three studies reported the association between former vs. never smoking, with the pooled relative riskestimates of 3.05 (1.18-7.84) (Figure 2C). The corresponding funnel plot is shown in Web Clinical factors: hypertension, diabetes, and prior CVD All eligible studies with data on hypertension reported a positive association of hypertension with severe COVID-19 (Figure 3A and Web Figure 4A), with the primary pooled relative risk estimate of 2.87 (95% CI 2.09-3.93). Most eligible studies also demonstrated a positive association between diabetes and severe COVID-19 (Figure 3B and Web Figure 4B), with the primary pooled relative risk estimate of 3.20 (2.26-4.53). Similarly, a majority of eligible studies showed a positive association between prior CVD and severe COVID-19, with the primary pooled relative risk of 4.97 (3.76-6.58) (Figure 3C and Web Figure 4C). None of these metaanalyses demonstrated high heterogeneity with I 2 >75%. There was no indication of publication bias for these comorbidities (Web Figure 3C-E). In the one available study that assessed lowdensity lipoprotein as a risk factor of COVID-19, Wu et al reported that higher levels were associated with lower risk of severe COVID-19 (0.63 [0.44-0.88] per 1 mmol/L increment) 32 ; no other lipid fractions were reported. No study explored renin-angiotensin system inhibitors as a risk factor for severe COVID-19.",

For pre-existing CVD, the pooled adjusted relative risk estimate across three studies was 1.75 (1.12-2.73) (Figure 4). Although these studies accounted for different confounders, all included age. Two studies reported adjusted relative risk for diabetes, but one of them was likely to have overadjustment bias by including potential mediators such as kidney failure, ARDS, and end organ damage markers (natriuretic peptide, cardiac troponin, and serum creatinine). The other study by Liang et al with 1,590 patients reported an adjusted odds ratio of 2.21 (1.33-3.66) for diabetes.23 This study also showed the adjusted odds ratio of 1.88 (1.22-2.90) for hypertension.",
