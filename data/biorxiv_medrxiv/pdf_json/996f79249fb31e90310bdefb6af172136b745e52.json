The phylogenomic analysis indicates the presence of at least four distinct groups of the SARS-CoV-2 genomes. The emergent groups have been found to be associated with signature structural changes in specific proteins. Also, this study reveals the differential levels of divergence patterns for the protein coding regions. Moreover, we have predicted the impact of structural changes on a couple of important viral proteins via structural modelling techniques. This study further advocates for more viral genetic studies with associated clinical outcomes and hosts' response for better understanding of SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis enabling better mitigation of this pandemic situation.",

Although, it was reported that SARS-CoV-2 infection is less severe as compared to that of SARS or MERS, it is now evident that the current novel coronavirus has an accelerated rate of human-to-human transmission than its predecessors Huang et al., 2020) . SARS-CoV-2 genome is around 29,903 nucleotides and organized in the following order from 5' to 3': ORF1ab (replicase), structural spike glycoprotein (S), ORF3a protein, structural envelope protein (E), structural membrane glycoprotein (M), ORF6 protein, ORF7a protein, ORF7b protein, ORF8 protein, structural nucleocapsid phosphoprotein (N) and ORF10 protein. ORF1ab is a large polyprotein (~21,291 nucleotides) encoding sixteen non-structural proteins: leader protein, nsp2, nsp3, nsp4, 3C-like proteinase, nsp6, nsp7, nsp8, nsp9, nsp10, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), helicase, 3'-to 5' exonuclease, endoRNAse, 2'-o-ribose methyltransferase, and nsp11 (Wu et al., 2020) .

Although the earlier studies with similar RNA pathogens (e.g. HIV-1, Influenza viruses, SARS-CoV and hepatitis C virus) pointed towards the rapidly evolving nature of the viral genomes and are subjected to the strongest evolutionary forces. The ability to undergo host-specific adaptive changes in the viral genomes has enabled them to escape the innate as well as adaptive immune responses, acquire resistance towards drugs or infect new hosts (Frost et al., 2018) . The rapid spread of SARS-CoV-2 around the world has enabled exposure of the virus to individuals with diverse genetic and immunological backgrounds having varied demographics (age, sex, environmental conditions, etc.) and thus potentially imposing significant selective pressures on the SARS-CoV-2 genomes. Therefore, a study highlighting the genome divergence of SARS-CoV-2 would have tremendous importance during this pandemic, providing better understanding of the genetic and phenotypic characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis and valuable information towards the development of drugs and vaccines.",

We performed the phylogenetic and other evolutionary analyses of the SARS-CoV-2 genomes, in order to reveal their shared ancestry, determine genetic diversity and detect structural mutations. This enabled us to study the divergence of this viral genome during the early phases of pandemic and identify multiple viral variants. Through computational analysis we predicted the impact of structural changes on spike glycoprotein (S). Additionally, we also studied the impact of the mutations on RdRp as it is considered to be one of the most promising target for drug development with remdesvir Warren et al., 2016) , a nucleotide analog targeting RdRp.

Among them the small, integral membrane protein E is important at different stages of the life cycle of this virus, viz. assembly, budding, envelope formation, and pathogenesis. The highly conserved nature of this protein indicates that a specific structural requirement is necessary for the proper functioning of this protein in the viral life cycle as well as in its pathogenicity. The association of mutation is based on the four genes: nsp2, nsp12 (RdRp), geneS and ORF8 (Table 1 ). The amino acid change V198I in nsp2 is associated with the emergence of group E, comprising mostly of Indian isolates and those from Germany and Iran. The change P323L in the RdRp gene is a signature for all the members of group B except isolate Germany003. This group is also associated with the change of D614G in spike glycoprotein S. This particular group has probably emerged in the later phase of the pandemic and harbour a considerable amount of Indian isolates.

RBD consists of 331-524 amino acid residues of the SARS-CoV-2 S protein (Tai et al., 2020) . In comparison with the S protein sequence pattern from index genome, Indian spike protein sequences possess five different variants arising due to 5 different structural mutations.

The basic characteristics of these two proteins are so unique that their exchange through mutation will result in conformational change in the structure which may contribute towards the host cell recognition for receptor binding. According to our secondary structure prediction of India specific sequences with respect to the index S sequence, we observed a change in secondary structural conformation.

The polar uncharged residue, serine (S) is mutated to non-polar aromatic phenylalanine (F). Similar to the previous mutations, due to this exchange it loses the hydrophilic polar nature of the hydroxyl (-OH) moiety and attains a hydrophobic aromatic side chain that can repel themselves away from the aqueous environment. Interestingly, this replacement leads to gain in the flexibility which has an impact on their secondary structure. Our analyses suggest that the \u03b2-turn like coil conformations on the Wuhan isolated structures is converted onto the more flexible sheet-like conformations at 438 position. In tertiary structure analysis, it is observed that since a hydroxyl group has been substituted by phenyl substituent, more protein conformational space is occupied. As a result, the molar volume is increased from 67.8 ml/mol to the 121.1 ml/mol. Expectedly, the electrostatic and binding entropies (\u0394\u0394G) have been modified to the 1.942 kcal/mol which signify more stabilized conformations. The introduction of bulky phenyl groups led to the change in vibrational entropy (\u0394\u0394SVib ENCoM: -0.545 kcal.mol -1 .K -1), which implies lower molecular flexibility of the backbone protein. The mutation also has impact on the structural integrity. In the wild type structure, the intramolecular hydrogen bonding has been observed between Ser438 to the Leu441, Asp442, Ser443 and Pro507. On mutation, there is a loss of ionic interactions and the hydrogen bonding has been modified between Phe438 to the Asn440 and Pro507 ( Figure 5C, 5D ). All these data suggest that the mutation S438F might affect the bindings of the S protein with the host receptor.",

Structurally, SARS-CoV-2 nsp12 protein is categorized into N-terminal (1-397 aa) and a polymerase domain (398-919 aa) and is comparable to the previous SARS-CoV nsp12 (PDB ID: 6NUR). The polymerase domain can be subdivided into structurally different three subunits; a finger (398-581 and 628-687 aa), a palm (582-627 and 688-815 aa), and a thumb subunit (816-919 aa) which adopts a \"right-handed\" cupped shaped conformation (Yin et al., 2020) . The active site of RdRp is present at the interface between finger and thumb subunits of the SARS-CoV-2 RdRp, which is a conserved domain with MERS and SARS-nsp12. The active site is situated in the center of the substrate domain where RNA synthesis takes place on the entry of the RNA template from template entry channel and NTP (Nucleoside Triphosphate) through the NTP entry channel (Peersen OB., 2017) . The structural analysis of the SARS-CoV-2 specified nsp12 revealed the presence of seven conserved motifs (A-G motifs) (Figure 7) . These motifs play crucial roles towards the binding of template and nucleotide as well as catalysis of the NTP addition (Poch et al., 1989; Bruenn JA., 2003; Mirza et al., 2019) . Several antiviral drugs act by attaching onto the first replicated base pairs and terminates the chain elongation process. The RdRp binding affinity towards the template RNA has been increased by the association of the co-factor nsp7 and nsp8 with the nsp12. RNA polymerization activity is found to be inhibited in presence of the active triphosphate form of Remdesivir (RTP), which is under clinical trial (Yin et al., 2020; Shannon et al., 2020) . proper positioning of the polymerase active site is fully depended on the N-terminal structural conformations. In this mutation a hydrophobic proline (P) has been mutated to the similar hydrophobic aliphatic leucine (L). Secondary structure analysis revealed the structural conformation changes after mutation. Although proline is known as \"helix breakers\" since they interrupt the . CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International license (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder.

Whereas mutated residue leucine contains the bulkier C-beta branched aliphatic side chains and found present as a sheet-like conformation (Figure4 of supplementary information). In the tertiary structure analysis suggest that the mutation is present in the N-terminal region which is connected to the finger subdomain ( Figure   7 ). So this mutation on the N-terminal domain may hamper the proper folding of the SARS-CoV-2 RdRp backbone protein, which can play a vital role for the protein's consequent degradation (te Velthuis AJ., 2010) .",

Alanine 406 is not in the active site domain but this is present on the template RNA entry channel. In this mutation hydrophobic aliphatic alanine is converted to a similar class of non-polar valine residue. As a result such mutation is not expected to cause any significant change in protein functionalities. However, due to the presence of the bulkier C-beta branched-chain, it restricted the protein main backbone to attain the alpha-helical conformations. Also, the heavy C-beta branching reduces the side chain flexibilities, which can modify the RNA template entry and if the RNA template cant enters on to the catalytic domain, RNA synthesis finally gets hampered. In another mutation (N874S) the polar uncharged asparagine (N) is replaced with similar polar uncharged serine (S). However, there is a different polar group with Asn carry an amide group and Ser has a hydroxyl group. Also, due to a slight reduction of side-chain length in Ser as compared to Asn, flexibilities of the \u03b2-turn conformation will be hampered. As this mutation is observed near the NTP entry channel (Figure 7) , any changes in the conserved \u03b2-turn conformation of the backbone protein might affect the NTP channel and interfere the RNA synthesis. Interestingly, such Asn to Ser mutation has been found to confer oseltamivir resistance to H5N1 influenza A viruses (Kiso et al., 2011) .",

The phylogeny indicates the emergence of new variants in this phase of the pandemic and two distinct groups of isolates emerge (Figure 1). The group A is more diverse and comprises of several sub-groups, it also includes the ancestral sequence (NC_045512.2) isolated from the patient in Wuhan, China, reported to WHO on 31/12/2019. The majority of the members in this group are from different states of China and other Asian countries although few European and USA isolates are also present. Out of 33 genomes sequenced from India, 15 sequences belong to this diverse group. The diverse nature of this group points towards the emergence of multiple viral variants within China before the spread of the virus throughout the world. The presence of genomes from other countries indicates the direct transmission of this virus from China. A detailed observation revealed the sub-group nature of this large group, implying the emergence of new variants. On the other hand, group B is more compact and comprises of European isolates and 18 Indian isolates. It is therefore quite clear that the European genomes diverged profoundly from the initial viral genomes from China and were transmitted to India. These particular isolates represent that the viral variants emerged after the start of the pandemic. We further evaluated the OrthoANI values for all vs all pairs of genomes and found that the value was always more than 99.8% suggesting very close similarity. The correlation clustering of these values also indicates the segregation of isolates into two groups (A & B) and further clear subgrouping (C, D & E) of the major group A",
