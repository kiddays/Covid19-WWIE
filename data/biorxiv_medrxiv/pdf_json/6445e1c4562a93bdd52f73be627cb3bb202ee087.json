            "text": "COVID-19 has prompted many countries to implement extensive social distancing to stop the rapid spread of the virus, in order to prevent overloading health care systems. Yet, the main epidemic parameters of this virus are not well understood. In the absence of broad testing or serological surveillance, it is hard to evaluate or predict the impact of different strategies to exit implemented lock-down measures. An age-structured epidemiological model was developed, which distinguishes between the younger versus older population (e.g. < 65 and \u2265 65). Because the illness severity is markedly different for these two populations, such a separation is necessary when estimating the model based on death and hospitalization incidence data. The model was applied to data of the Belgian epidemic and used to predict how the epidemic would react to a relaxing of social distancing measures.",

One such often used class of models are compartment models, which use differential equations to describe in a deterministic way how individuals move between different compartments, each of which indicates a certain disease state. Standard compartment models are SIR or SEIR models, which use up to four compartments: Susceptible (\"S\"), Exposed (\"E\"), Infectious (\"I\"), and Removed (\"R\"). If however the transmission of the virus is different in the younger and older population, and also the incidence and mortality differs between these age groups, the main assumptions for estimating such models from case data are violated and conclusions drawn from such estimates may be unfounded.",

We add to a standard SEIR model the process in which infections give rise to hospitalizations and reported deaths. Rather than adding more compartments to the model, we model the number of hospitalizations as an independent process proportional to the incidence of an infection (when an individual moves from the \"S\" to \"E\" compartment), with a time delay. Likewise, reported deaths are modeled based on the removal of the infected individual (to the \"R\" compartment).

We considered the Belgian epidemic with two age-groups: a \"younger group\" y (< 65) and an \"older group\" o (\u2265 65). This division coincides more or less with a division of the active and retired population, in which one may expect different patterns of social interactions, leading to different transmission dynamics. Deaths reported in elderly care facilities (and which were in many cases not confirmed to be caused by COVID-19), were removed from the analysis, as the transmission into and within elderly care facilities is most likely quite different from elderly people living at home. Although about 100000 people older than > 65 are living in Belgian care centers (estimated by extrapolating percentage statistics from Flanders to the entire country), over 25 times as many do not.

The large uncertainty on these parameter estimates is likely because only three days of hospitalization and death incidence data are available before lockdown, and thus all later data is confounded by the impact of lockdown. Because of the higher R 0 value in the younger age group, it is estimated that the virus circulated more within the younger age group than the older age group, before lockdown, see Figure 5 (Infected people). Thus, social interaction within and between the older age group is by its own able to prevent to a large extent the rapid spread of the virus. The lockdown measures brought the basic reproduction number in the younger age group down to R t = 0.8 (0.7 -0.9), in the older age group to 0.3 (0.1 -0.8) and from the younger to the older age group to 0.5 (0.0 -2.0). By April 1, the prevalence of the virus is estimated to be similar in the two age groups, and declining. The measures thus brought the epidemic under control and the pressure on the health care system can be expected to decline as long as the lockdown measures are adhered to.",
