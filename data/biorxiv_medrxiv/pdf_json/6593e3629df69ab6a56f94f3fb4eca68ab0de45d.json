In this study, we reconstituted a replicon reporter system, composed of plasmids expressing the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP) complex (PA, PB1 and PB2), nucleocapsid (NP) protein, and a reporter gene flanked by the 3' and 5' UTR of the envelope glycoprotein (GP) genome segment. By using the luciferase reporter, we screened a few small molecule compounds of anti-endonuclease that inhibited the nicking activity by parvovirus B19 (B19V) NS1, as well as FDA-approved drugs targeting the RdRP of influenza virus. Our results demonstrated that myricetin, and an anti-B19V NS1 nicking inhibitor, efficiently inhibited the RdRP activity of BRBV and virus replication. The IC50 and EC50 of myricetin are 2.22 \u00b5M and 4.6 \u00b5M, respectively, in cells. Myricetin had minimal cytotoxicity in cells, and therefore the therapeutic index of the compound is high. In conclusion, the BRBV replicon system is a useful tool to study viral RNA replication and to develop antivirals, and myricetin may hold promise in treatment of BRBV infected patients.",

The patient died due to a complex syndrome of leukopenia, lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, hyponatremia, and increased levels of aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase. Due to the high level of viremia and unique identification of the virus in the serum taken from the patient, BRBV was believed to be the cause of the illness and the death of the patient. Later, two additional cases of BRBV infection have been reported. In 2015, a patient from Payne County, Oklahoma, USA tested positive for neutralization antibodies to BRBV before fully recovering (Savage, et al., 2017) . In June 2017, a 58-year-old woman from Missouri died from an infection of BRBV after she had been misdiagnosed for a significant period of time (Bricker, et al., 2019) .

However, the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), USA, currently does not know if the virus may be found in other areas of the United States, since a seroprevalence of BRBV infection has not been evaluated outside of these epidemic regions. Nevertheless, BRBV is the first species of the genus Thogotovirus of the Orthomyxoviridae family to be identified as a human pathogen in the New World . BRBV is widely carried by the lone star tick (Amblyomma americanum), a species that is aggressive, feeds on humans, and is widely distributed across the East, Southeast, and Midwest States. BRBV was found in 3 pools of lone star ticks from retrospective tests in 39,096 ticks from northwestern Missouri, 240 km from Bourbon County, Kansas, USA (Savage, et al., 2017) . The human BRBV and the strain isolated from tick pools share >99.0% sequence at the amino acid level and 95.0% identity at the RNA sequence level (Savage, et al., 2017) . BRBV replicates in cell lines derived from the hard ticks Amblyomma, Hyalomma and Rhipicephalus . Together with the geographic location of the BRBV infection and the geographic distribution of a number of Amblyomma americanum ticks (Savage, et al., 2017; Savage, et al., 2018) , these studies strongly suggest that the lone star tick is a vector of BRBV transmission to humans.",

Based on the pHW2000-GP plasmid, we inserted a GFP open reading frame (ORF) and a secreted Gaussia luciferase (gLuc) ORF between the 3' and 5' UTR of the GP segment (Fig. 4A) . When pHW2000-GFP was co-transfected with pcDNA-PA, PB1, PB2, and NP plasmids in HEK293T cells, at 7 days post-transfection, green fluorescence was clearly observed in cells transfected with pcDNA-PA, PB1, PB2, and NP plasmids but not in cells transfected with all plasmids except pcDNA-PA (Fig. 4B) . Similarly, a high luciferase activity was detected in the cells co-transfected with pHW2000-gLuc and pcDNA-PA, PB1, PB2, and NP plasmids, but nearly background levels were detected in cells transfected with pHW2000-Luc and pcDNA-PB1, PB2, and NP plasmids (Fig. 4C) . Overall, there was a 10-fold increase in luciferase activity by the addition of the pcDNA-PA plasmid, suggesting a function of the RdRP activity from expression of PA, PB1, PB2, and NP.",

Mice (CD-1) were susceptible to BRBV infection as evidenced by seroconversion, but the infection did not cause disease symptoms or death of the animals . Recently, mice lacking IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 receptor expression (IFN\u03b1AR -/-) have been used as an animal model to evaluate antivirals against BRBV (Bricker, et al., 2019; Fuchs, et al., 2019) . Favipiravir, a pan inhibitor of RdRP (Furuta, et al., 2005) , was shown to protect IFN\u03b1AR -/mice from lethal BRBV infection. The EC50 of favipiravir against BRBV infection of Vero was 310 \u00b5M (Bricker, et al., 2019) . In animals, administration of 150 mg/kg of favipiravir twice daily at 3 days post-infection protected all animals from death of BRBV infection. However, it was speculated that favipiravir reached a concentration of 1.28 mM in serum, leading to the argument that it is not practical to use favipiravir to treat BRBV-infected patients.
