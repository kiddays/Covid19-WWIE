            "text": "Governments around the world are responding to the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic 1 2 with unprecedented policies designed to slow the growth rate of infections. Many actions, 3 such as closing schools and restricting populations to their homes, impose large and visible 4 costs on society. In contrast, the benefits of these policies, in the form of infections that 5 did not occur, cannot be directly observed and are currently understood through process-based 6 simulations. 2-4 Here, we compile new data on 1,659 local, regional, and national anti-contagion 7 policies recently deployed in the ongoing pandemic across localities in China, South Korea, Iran, 8 Italy, France, and the United States (US). We then apply reduced-form econometric methods, 9 commonly used to measure the effect of policies on economic growth, to empirically evaluate 10 the effect that these anti-contagion policies have had on the growth rate of infections. In the 11 absence of any policy actions, we estimate that early infections of COVID-19 exhibit exponential 12 growth rates of roughly 42% per day. We find that anti-contagion policies collectively have had 13 significant effects slowing this growth. Our results suggest that similar policies may have 14 different impacts on different populations, but we obtain consistent evidence that the policy 15 packages now deployed are achieving large, beneficial, and measurable health outcomes. We 16 estimate that, to date, current policies have already prevented or delayed on the order of 62 : medRxiv preprint 65 growth rates. Similarly to early COVID-19 infections, economic output generally increases exponen-66 tially with a variable rate that can be affected by policies and other conditions. Unlike process-based 67 epidemiological models, 7-9, 12, 22, 29, 30 the reduced-form statistical approach to inference that we ap-68 ply does not require explicit prior information about fundamental epidemiological parameters or 69 mechanisms, many of which remain uncertain in the current pandemic. Rather, the collective influ-70 ence of these factors is empirically recovered from the data without modeling their individual effects 71 explicitly (see Methods). Prior work on influenza, 31 for example, has shown that such statistical 72 approaches can provide important complementary information to process-based models.",

We use data from first-or second-level administrative units and data on 76 active or cumulative cases, depending on availability (see Supplementary Information) . We then 77 employ widely-used panel regression models 23, 24 to estimate how the daily growth rate of infections 78 changes over time within a location when different combinations of large-scale social policies are 79 enacted (see Methods). Our econometric approach accounts for differences in the baseline growth 80 rate of infections across sub-national locations, which may be affected by time-invariant charac-81 teristics, such as demographics, socio-economic status, culture, and health systems; it accounts for 82 systematic patterns in growth rates within countries unrelated to policy, such as the effect of the 83 work-week; it is robust to systematic under-surveillance specific to each sub-national unit; and it 84 accounts for changes in procedures to diagnose positive cases (see Methods and Supplementary 85 Information). The reduced-form statistical techniques we use are designed to measure the total 86 magnitude of the effect of changes in policy, without attempting to explain the origin of baseline 87 growth rates or the specific epidemiological mechanisms linking policy changes to infection growth 88 rates (see Methods). Thus, this approach does not provide the important mechanistic insights 89 generated by process-based models; however, it does effectively quantify the key policy-relevant re-90 lationships of interest using recent real-world data, when fundamental epidemiological parameters 91 are still uncertain. 92 Results 93 We estimate that in the absence of policy, early infection rates of COVID-19 grow 42% per day on 94 average (Standard Error [SE] = 7%), implying a doubling time of approximately 2 days. Country-95 specific estimates range from 24% per day in China (SE = 9%) to 69% per day in Iran (SE = 96 5%). Growth rates in South Korea, Italy, France, and the US are very near the 42% average 97 value (Figure 2a). These estimated values differ from observed growth rates because the latter are 98 confounded by the effects of policy. These growth rates are not driven by the expansion of testing or 99 increasing rates of case detection (see Methods and Extended Data Fig. 2) and are not dependent 100 on data from any particular region of any country (Extended Data Fig. 3).",

            "text": "The 2019 novel coronavirus 1 (COVID-19) pandemic is forcing societies around the world to make 22 consequential policy decisions with limited information. After containment of the initial outbreak 23 failed, attention turned to implementing large-scale social policies designed to slow contagion of 24 the virus, 6 with the ultimate goal of slowing the rate at which life-threatening cases emerge so as 25 to not exceed the capacity of existing medical systems. In general, these policies aim to decrease It is therefore not surprising that some populations hesitate before implementing such dramatic 40 policies, particularly when these costs are visible while their health benefits -infections and deaths 41 that would have occurred but instead were avoided or delayed -are unseen. Our objective is to 42 measure the direct health benefits of these policies; specifically, how much these policies slowed the 43 growth rate of infections. We treat recently implemented policies as hundreds of different natural 44 experiments proceeding in parallel. Our hope is to learn from the recent experience of six countries 45 where early spread of the virus triggered large-scale policy actions, in part so that societies and 46 decision-makers in the remaining 180+ countries can access this information. 47 Here we directly estimate the effects of 1,659 local, regional, and national policies on the growth 48 rate of infections across localities within China, France, Iran, Italy, South Korea, and the US (see ological factors, such as disease infectivity and contact networks, as well as policies that induce 59 behavior changes. 7, 8, 22 We cannot experimentally manipulate policies ourselves, but because they 60 are being deployed while the epidemic unfolds, we can estimate their effects empirically. We exam-61 ine how the daily growth rate of infections in each locality changes in response to the collection of 62 ongoing policies applied to that locality on that day. 63 We employ well-established \"reduced-form\" econometric techniques 23, 24 commonly used to mea-64 sure the effects of policies 25, 26 or other events (e.g., wars 27 or environmental changes 28 ) on economic growth rates until after a fixed number of days, but we do not find evidence this improves model 144 fit (Extended Data Fig. 5b ). 145 The estimates described above (Figure 2b ) capture the superposition of all policies deployed 146 in each country, i.e., they represent the average effect of policies on infection growth rates that 147 we would expect to observe if all policies enacted anywhere in each country were implemented 148 simultaneously in a region of that country. We also estimate the effects of individual policies or 149 clusters of policies that are grouped either based on their similarity in goal (e.g., library closures and 150 museum closures are grouped) or timing (e.g., policies that are generally deployed simultaneously 151 in a certain country). In many cases, our estimates for these effects are statistically noisier than 152 the estimates for all policies combined because we are estimating multiple effects simultaneously. 153 Thus, we are less confident in the individual estimates and in their relative rankings. Estimated 154 effects differ between countries, and policies are neither identical nor perfectly comparable in their 155 implementation across countries or, in many cases, across different localities within the same coun- mates that are positive, five of which are small in magnitude (< 0.1) and not statistically different 160 from zero (5% level). Consistent with greater overall uncertainty in these dis-aggregated estimates, 161 some in China, France, Italy, and South Korea are somewhat more sensitive to dropping regional 162 blocks of data (Extended Data Fig. 4) . The estimated effects of individual policies are broadly 163 robust to assuming a constant delayed effect of all policies (Extended Data Fig. 5c ). 164 We combine the estimates above with our data on the timing of the 1,659 policy deployments 165 to estimate the total effect of all policies across the dates in our sample. To do this, we use our 166 estimates to predict the growth rate of infections in each locality on each day, given the policies 167 in effect at that location on that date (Figure 3 , blue markers). We then use the same model 168 to predict what counterfactual growth rates would be on that date if all policies were removed 169 ( Figure 3 , red markers), which we refer to as a \"no-policy scenario.\" The difference between these 170 two predictions is our estimated effect that all anti-contagion policies actually deployed had on 171 the growth rate of infections. We estimate that since the beginning of our sample, on average, Table 4 ) or assuming a delayed effect of policy on infection growth rates (Supplementary Table 5 ). we study would have initially followed rapid exponential growth had no policies been applied, 208 our results suggest that these ongoing policies are currently providing large health benefits.

Consistent with process-based simulations of COVID-19 212 infections, 2, 4, 10-12, 14, 17, 29 our empirical analysis of existing policies indicates that seemingly small 213 delays in policy deployment likely produce dramatically different health outcomes. 214 While the limited amount of currently available data poses challenges to our analysis, our aim 215 is to use what data exist to estimate the first-order impacts of unprecedented policy actions in an 216 ongoing global crisis. As more data become available, empirical research findings will become more 217 precise and may capture more complex interactions. For example, this analysis does not account for 218 potentially important interactions between populations in nearby localities, 7, 38 nor the structure 219 of mobility networks. 3, 4, 10, 12, 17, 39 Nonetheless, we hope the results we are able to obtain at this 220 early stage of the pandemic can support critical decision-making, both in the countries we study 221 and in the other 180+ countries where COVID-19 infections have been reported.",

            "text": "A key advantage of our reduced-form \"top down\" statistical approach is that it captures the real-223 world behavior of affected populations without requiring that we explicitly model all underlying 224 mechanisms and processes. This property is useful in the current stage of the pandemic when 225 many process-related parameters remain unknown. However, our results cannot and should not be 226 interpreted as a substitute for process-based epidemiological models specifically designed to provide 227 guidance in public health crises. Rather, our results complement existing models, for example, 228 by helping to calibrate key model parameters. We believe both forward-looking simulations and 229 backward-looking empirical evaluations should be used to inform decision-making. 230 Our analysis measures changes in local infection growth rates associated with changes in anti-231 contagion policies, treating each subnational administrative unit as if it were in a natural experi-232 ment. Intuitively, each administrative unit observed just prior to a policy deployment serves as the 233 \"control\" for the same unit in the days after it receives a policy \"treatment\". Thus, a necessary 234 condition for our estimates to be interpreted as the plausibly causal effect of these policies is that 235 the timing of policy deployment is independent of infection growth rates. 23 Such an assumption is 236 supported by epidemiological theory, which predicts that infection totals in the absence of policy 237 will be near-perfectly exponential early in the epidemic, 7 implying that pre-policy infection growth 238 rates in this context should be constant. The policies we analyze are unlikely to have been de-239 10 ployed in reaction to or anticipation of changes in growth rates, since epidemiological guidance to 240 decision-makers explicitly projected constant growth rates in the absence of anti-contagion mea-241 sures. 2, 29, 40, 41 In practice, decision-makers have tended to deploy policies in response to the count 242 of total infections in their locality, rather than their growth rate, 2 in response to outbreaks in other overstate the effectiveness of anti-contagion policies. We note, however, that if public information 260 is increasing in response to policy actions, then it should be considered a pathway through which 261 policies alter infection growth, not a form of bias. Investigating these potential effects is beyond 262 the scope of this analysis, but it is an important topic for future investigations.",

Existing evidence has not demonstrated whether policies should affect infection growth rates in the days immediately following deployment. It is therefore not clear ex ante whether the policy variables in Eq. 7 should be encoded as \"on\" immediately following a policy deployment. We estimate \"fixed-lag\" models in which a fixed delay between a policy's deployment and its effect is assumed (see Supplementary Methods 3). If a delay model is more consistent with real world infection dynamics, these fixed lag models should recover larger estimates for the impact of policies and exhibit better model fit. a , Because data from China cover a longer period with fewer policies that are each implemented early in the sample, we estimated an explicit distributed lag model in the main article ( Figure  2 ), finding evidence of policy impacts in the first week of deployment and evidence that these effects increase in the following weeks. Using a reduced sample of 36 Chinese cities where at least five days of infection data are available before and after the first policy ( home isolation ) is deployed, we implement an event study. Orange markers show the 3 average infection growth rate in the five days immediately prior to and following the first policy deployment. b , R-squared values associated with fixed-lag lengths varying from zero to fifteen days. In-sample fit generally declines or remains unchanged if policies are assumed to have a delay longer than four days (whiskers are 95% CI computed through resampling). c , Estimated effects for no lag (the model reported in the main text) and for fixed-lags between one and five days. Estimates generally are unchanged or shrink towards zero (e.g. Home isolation in Iran), consistent with mis-coding of post-policy days as no-policy days. .

For all panels, the difference between the with-and no-policy predictions is our estimated effect of actual anti-contagion policies on the growth rate of infections (or hospitalizations). The markers are daily estimates for each subnational administrative unit (vertical lines are 95% confidence intervals).

Prior to this regime change, the KCDC separated those two cases and applied different quarantine policies; starting February 4, 2020, any routine contacts were also required to be self-quarantined. 49 Shortly thereafter, South Korea aggressively expanded the scope of their testing. Starting February 7, 2020, the KCDC broadened the definition of suspected cases to 1) anyone who developed a fever or respiratory symptoms within 14 days after returning from China, 2) anyone who developed a fever or respiratory symptoms within 14 days after being in close contact with a confirmed case, and 3) anyone suspected of contracting COVID-19 based on their travel history to affected countries and their clinical symptoms. Moreover, the KCDC announced that the test would be free for all suspected cases and 50 confirmed cases. As a result of these efforts, KCDC announced that they would begin to test 3,000 51 people daily, a marked increase from only 200 people a day previously. 52",

Each higher unit should only have a non-zero intensity for optional or for mandatory (or neither), but not both. 3. For broadly defined policy variables like \" social_distance \" that could encompass a variety of country-specific policies: The \" policy_intensity \" assignment differs by country. If the specific policies employed at the various administrative levels are the same policy, then the approach in (1) is used. If they are different policies within the same broad category, then we add instead of taking the maximum, allow for both optional and mandatory policies, and and otherwise follow the approach of (1). This addition is appropriate across different administrative divisions because of (1). If some policies are the same and some are different, we use a combination of addition and taking the maximum over the \" policy_intensity \" values. For instances when we add the \" policy_intensity \" values, once the processed dataset has been constructed and formatted, the last step is to normalize each variable such that it takes values between 0 and 1 (e.g. if the maximum from addition of sub-policies is 1.4, divide that entire column by 1.4). This standardization should again be done separately for each mandatory and optional version of each policy.",

By February 22, 2020 the government closed schools in 14 provinces and closed down major gathering sites such as football matches and theaters. By March 5, 2020 schools were closed nationwide and government employees were required to work from home.

As a result, the CDC began releasing guidance to those at risk of being exposed to the virus. The initial recommendations included travel warnings for specific countries with confirmed cases and sustained COVID-19 spread. Over the course of our dataset, these warnings increased in intensity, changing from warning against inbound and outbound travel to specific countries in both Europe and Asia to warning against travel at all. International 148 travel restrictions were coded as \" travel_ban_int_out \" for outbound travel, and \" travel_ban_int_in \" for inbound travel, with lists of the places to and from which travel was restricted also included. On March 31, 2020, the US changed its global travel warning to Level 4, the highest warning level, which the US Department of State defines as avoiding \"all international travel due to the global impact of COVID-19.\" In addition to the national travel restrictions, individual states also implemented local 149 travel bans, coded as \" travel_ban_local \" as the spread continued to grow, such that anyone entering specific states in which this policy was in effect were required to self-quarantine for 14 days. This ultimately reflected the national policy as well, in that people could still technically travel under a Level 4 warning, but upon arrival to the US, they would be put in a mandatory quarantine for 14 days.",

Because of this, exponential models estimating the average treatment effect (ATE) of a policy may underestimate the true reduction seen from a policy because they include days in which the growth rate was still higher than the new steady state growth rate.

We assume the majority of the \"exposed but not infectious\" population will not yet have been tested and will not appear in any of the datasets used in the main analysis. Our right-hand-side variables consist of the binary policy variables, allowing only for contemporaneous effects. This matches our main specification for all countries except China (where data availability allows for the estimate of lagged effects) and provides the most challenging environment in which to estimate the effect of policy in a dynamic system. Figures 8 and 9 . While it is possible to simulate outbreaks consisting of innumerable parameter combinations and noise distributions, we display those that seem most relevant for evaluating the robustness of our main analysis. Our associated GitHub repository contains a Jupyter notebook for readers to further examine the effect of simulation configurations on regression model robustness. Because the growth rate prior to policy has likely approached its asymptotic rate by the time we begin our regressions, variance in our no-policy growth rate estimates comes from noise in the disease parameters and measurement. The ability to recover unbiased estimates of this value has important implications for our estimate of the total number of cases averted/delayed to date, as this number is primarily driven by the counterfactual number of cases we would expect to see in a world in which no anti-contagion policy was enacted. Figure 9 demonstrates that our model recovers unbiased estimates of the cumulative effect for a disease with very short latency. As the latency period increases, the model begins to slightly underestimate the true effect of policy (i.e. it predicts a less negative value), due to the decay time over which a shock to transmission rate propagates to a new steady-state growth rate. The underestimate is reduced in situations where we are able to directly observe active infections and is increased when we can only observe cumulative infections. Note that statistical uncertainty in these estimated parameters dominates potential biases, even in \"worst case\" data conditions.",

It is therefore not clear ex ante whether the policy variables in Eq. 7 should be encoded as \"on\" immediately following a policy deployment.

Specifically, we assume that policies cannot influence infection growth rates for L days, recoding a policy variable at time t as zero if a policy was implemented fewer than L days before t . We re-estimate Equation (7) for each value of L and present results in Extended Data Figure 5 and Supplementary Table 5 .

Thus, persistent decreases in growth rates have a compounding 182 effect on total infections, at least until a shrinking susceptible population slows growth through a 183 different mechanism. To provide a sense of scale and context for our main results in Figs. 2 and 3, 184 we integrate the growth rate of infections in each locality from Figure 3 to estimate the total to date, both with actual anti-contagion policies and in the no-policy counterfactual 186 scenario. To account for the declining size of the susceptible population in each administrative unit, 187 we couple our econometric estimates of the effects of policies with a simple Susceptible-Infected-188 Removed (SIR) model of infectious disease dynamics 7, 22 that adjusts the susceptible population 189 based on previously estimated case-detection rates 36 (see Methods). This allows us to extend our 190 projections beyond the initial exponential growth phase of infections, a threshold which our results 191 suggest would currently be exceeded in several countries in the no-policy scenario. 192 Our results suggest that ongoing anti-contagion policies have already substantially reduced the 193 number of COVID-19 infections observed in the world today (Figure 4). Our central estimates 194 suggest that there would be roughly 27 million more cumulative confirmed cases in China, 20 195 million more in South Korea, 2.7 million more in Italy, 5.4 million more in Iran, 530,000 more 196 in France, and 5.1 million more in the US had these countries never enacted any anti-contagion 197 policies since the start of the pandemic. The relative magnitudes of these impacts partially reflects 198 the timing, intensity, and extent of policy deployment (e.g., how many localities deployed policies), 199 and the duration for which they have been applied. Several of these estimates are subject to large 200 statistical uncertainties (see intervals in Figure 4). Sensitivity tests that assume a range of plausible 201 alternative parameter values and disease dynamics, such as incorporating a Susceptible-Exposed-202 Infected-Removed (SEIR) model, suggest that policies may have reduced the number of infections 203 by a total of 57-65 million confirmed cases over the dates in our sample (central estimates). 204 Discussion 205 Overall, our results indicate that large-scale anti-contagion policies are achieving their intended 206 objective of slowing the growth rate of COVID-19 infections.

For example, if growing awareness of COVID-248 19 caused an increasing fraction of infected individuals to be tested over time, then unadjusted 249 infection growth rates later in our sample would be biased upwards. Because an increasing number 250 of policies are active later in these samples as well, this bias would cause our current findings to 251 understate the overall effectiveness of anti-contagion policies. However, our analysis of estimated 252 case-detection trends 36 (Extended Data Fig. 2) suggests that the magnitude of this potential bias 253 is small, elevating our estimated no-policy growth rates by 0.022 (6%) on average. 254 It is also possible that changing public information during the period of our study has some 255 unknown effect on our results.

While our estimate implies a recovery period (symptom onset to recovery) that is comparable to some estimates in the literature (median time of 19-23 days, varying based on age group, sex, severity, and mode of detection ), we test the extent to which our simulation results in Figure 4 depend on this 159 value. One motivation for this exercise is that there may be an unknown delay between the time when a patient becomes non-infectious in reality and the time in which they are recorded in the aggregate data as recovered. Assuming a (likely high) value of 14 days average delay between true recovery and recording this recovery generates an estimate of \u03b3 = 0.18, for example. Differential underreporting of recoveries versus cases, for example, could also bias the estimation of \u03b3 .",
