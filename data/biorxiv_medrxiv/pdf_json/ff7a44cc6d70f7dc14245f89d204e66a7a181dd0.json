The use of cotton tipped swabs for respiratory specimens collection is included at WHO guidelines (2) and it has been reported specifically reliable for respiratory retroviruses like influenza (4) . We also excluded any inhibitory effect over PCR reaction associated to plastic cotton tipped swabs. However, our data do not endorse to use any kind of cotton tipped swabs as wooden made ones as some chemicals derived from the wood could interfere with PCR reaction. Plastic cotton tipped swabs are cheap and made worldwide even in developing countries like Ecuador; and based on our results do not compromise neither sensitivity nor specificity for SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis. Its endorsement on international guidelines upon more independent validation studies would help to prevent SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis disruption due to swab supply shortage as recently happened in Ecuador.",
