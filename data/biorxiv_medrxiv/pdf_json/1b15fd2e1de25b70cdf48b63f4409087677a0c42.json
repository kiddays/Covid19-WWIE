Then, these data are divided into three sets, referred to training set, validation set and testing set. Sixteen data augmentation operations are designed to enrich the training set in deep learning training phase. Multiple experiments were conducted to analyze the performance of the model in the detection of COVID-19 both in case of no noisy labels and noisy labels. The performance was assessed by the area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUC), sensitivity, specificity and accuracy. Results The data augmentation operations on the training set is effective for improvement of the model performance. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve is 0.9689 with (95% CI: 0.9308, 1) in case of no noisy labels, while the per-exam sensitivity, specificity and accuracy for detecting COVID-19 in the independent testing set are 90.52%, 91.58% and 91.21%, respectively. Besides, the model is robust when part of the training samples is marked incorrectly. The AUC is 92.23% in the case of noisy labels of 10% in the training set. Conclusion A deep learning model with insufficient samples can be developed by using data augmentation in assisting medical workers in making quick and correct diagnosis of COVID-19.",

In [9] , the authors focus on interpreting the potential pathological basis from CT images and suggesting the future research and clinical directions, which will be greatly helpful for the radiologists in the clinical practice. Consequently, CT is an important tools in the diagnosis and treatment pathway of COVID-19 [10] . A CT scan takes only a few minutes, but some tens of minutes is needed for a group of experienced doctors to read the CT images and make the correct decision. In many areas, the virus spread quickly and there are a desperate shortage of experienced medical workers to evaluate large numbers of chest CT images.

Toward this direction, AI-based automated image analysis on CT images is a potential solution for COVID-19. In the past two months, there were a few excellent works proposed for doctors in making efficient diagnosis of COVID-19 [17] [18] [19] . In [17] , a convolutional neural network (CNN) using ResNet50 as the backbone to detect COVID-19 and distinguish it from community acquired pneumonia and other nonpneumonic lung diseases were proposed by using 4,356 3D chest CT exams. In [18] , the authors developed an automated CT image analysis method to distinguish COVID-19 patients from those who do not have the disease by using deep learning on a testing set of 157 international patients. The two datasets in [17, 18] are not open due to some reasons of privacy protection. Consequently, researchers tried to build public COVID-19 dataset in their researches [19, 20] . In [19] , the authors built a public dataset consisting of 275 CT scans positive for COVID- 19 and developed a CNN model using DenseNet169 on the dataset. The dataset in [20] is composed of a number of COVID-19 chest X-rays or CT scans collected for computer analysis.",

However, a large and reliable dataset is considered to be one of the biggest challenges for developing deep learning method in medical applications [14] , especially for current AI-based diagnosis of COVID-19. Firstly, COVID-19 samples are difficult to be collected because of protection of patient privacy. Besides, building a reliable dataset from clinical data needs experts to annotate labels. Since the complexity of the medical data and the different experiences among the experts, a medical dataset whose labels are completely reliable is not available, meaning that there may have noisy (or incorrect) labels in some training samples. In this situation, data augmentation (DA) technique could be used to generalize an AI model based on deep learning and the model has resistance to noisy labels in some training samples is required.",

Since the wide range of data sources may cause the problem of repetition or high correlation among the chest CT images, small part of collected CT images in these data sources are discarded. As a result, the chest CT images in the new dataset consist of 521 COVID-19 exams, 397 healthy subjects, 76 bacterial pneumonia and 48 SARS cases. In the total 521 COVID-19 exams, 349 are downloaded from [19] , 13 images are obtained from [20] and 159 are from the online site above. Based on these collected samples, the training set, validation set and testing set are allocated as shown in Table 1 Until now, it is still difficult to collect enough and high-quality COVID-19 chest CT images for the AI model. Usually, the AI-based methods especially for deep learning, need enough data for training and testing, otherwise it will be easily prone to the overfitting problem, and inhibit its capability to generalize to unseen invariant data [21] . A solution is to use DA operations [22] [23] [24] [25] to enrich the training samples for generalization and robustness of the model when the dataset is till small. In our method, the training set is expanded by using five types of DA techniques for improvement of the AI model while keeping the other two sets unchanged.",

The input of ShuffleNet V2 network is a chest CT image in a time after performing a random cropping operation. The output of the ShuffleNet V2 network is then fed to a linear layer to generate the diagnostic result. With enough data, the network can learn to recognize the characteristics of COVID-19, and extract the feature which will be sent to the linear layer to get a probability score for diagnosis of COVID-19.",

In other words, small part of samples could be marked incorrectly in the dataset. Toward the noisy label problem, we test and observe the robustness of the model to noise fraction. With a noise fraction, the corresponding samples in proportion will be randomly selected from the training sets and marked with incorrect labels. These noisy samples will keep unchanged in the whole training process. When the model runs stable by referring to the validation set, we can get the corresponding stable period. Fig.6 plots the loss values in the validation set under different noise fractions. In Fig.6(a) , the loss function becomes stable in the range between 200 to 600 epochs. From Fig.6(b) to Fig.6(i) , we can observe that when there exist noisy labels, the loss functions of the validation set need more epoches to reach a stable state. The larger the noise fraction is, the more epochs are required for the model training.
