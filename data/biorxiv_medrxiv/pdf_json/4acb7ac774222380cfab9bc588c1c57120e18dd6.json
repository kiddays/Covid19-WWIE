Mosaicism for X chromosome monosomy (XCM) shows a similar increase in aging population mostly driven by loss of chromosome Y in males (LOY), and is associated with a raise in all-cause mortality. Using comparative transcriptomic data, we have defined that XCM/LOY is associated with abnormal peripheral blood cell counts with decreased progenitor cells and multiple biomarkers of immune system dysfunction, pro-coagulation activity and increased cardiovascular risk. Several differentially down-regulated genes in XCM/LOY individuals are involved in the initial immune response to SARS-CoV-2 (OR of enrichment=7.23, p=1.5x10 -7 ), mainly interferon-induced genes that code for inhibitors of viral processes. Thus, our data suggest that XCM mosaicism underlies at least part of the sex-biased severity and mortality of COVID-19 in aging patients.",

            "text": "The ongoing pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) represents a major health threat to the entire world. 1 As of April 19, 2020 , there have been more than 2.3 million confirmed cases of COVID-19 worldwide, with more than 160,000 deaths reported. While good estimates of the case fatality ratios are widely lacking, it is clear that mortality is highest in old men. A best reported estimate of the overall case fatality ratio after adjusting for demography and underascertainment in the initial outbreak in China was 1.38% (95% CI 1.23-1.53), being significantly higher with aging (6.4% in \u2265 60 and 13.4% in \u2265 80 age groups) and in males; 2.8% as compared with 1.7% in females 2 . Emergent data of the age-stratified case fatality ratio and infection fatality ratio in other countries show a similar pattern with a remarkable sex-bias increasing with advancing age. The numbers and proportions may even further increase when patients in aged care facilities are fully registered. Sex-dependent differences in disease outcomes were also found during the past SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV epidemics 3, 4 and in mice infected with the virus. 5 Understanding the underlying basis of this different sex and age vulnerability is crucial because men and women are likely to have fundamentally different reactions to the SARS-CoV-2 virus infection, possible treatments and vaccines. Proposed causes include different case definition of disease, different environmental factors (such as life-style, smoking history or workenvironment) and sex-specific immune-defense factors. In particular, the X chromosome harbors multiple genes important for immunity and there are many X-linked immunodeficiencies, so males have greater susceptibility to infections starting at birth. 6 More specifically, SARS viruses use the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE2), encoded by an X-linked gene, as a receptor to enter and infect ACE-2 expressing cells. 1 Thus, sex variation in the expression of this gene with paradoxically higher expression and higher circulating levels in men than in women has also been proposed as a candidate mechanism. 7 However, ascertainment bias and environmental factors are unlikely to prevail in different populations while the gender-specific immune factors or ACE2 variation would not fully explain the increased risk and sex-divergence with aging.",

LOY is an age related phenomenon that has been associated with a wide spectrum of human diseases including cancer, Alzheimer's disease, cardiovascular disease, and reduced overall life expectancy in men.

In summary, XCM is relatively common in aging individuals with much higher frequency in males due to somatic LOY. It is associated to decreased progenitors and stem cells, along with immune system dysfunction and increased coagulation and cardiovascular risk as revealed by biochemical and gene expression data. Available data to date strongly suggest that this type of mosaicism may underlie at least part of the sex-biased severity and mortality of COVID-19 in aging patients, so additional studies are needed to validate and define the extent of our hypothesis. In order to achieve this goal and given its potential relevance for modulating prognosis and therapeutic response, we propose that evaluation of LOY and XCM by currently .

We observed a significant overlap of deregulated genes in LOY individuals that participate in the immediate immune response elicited by SARS-CoV-2 virus infection. Some of these genes clearly activated in both studied cell types infected by SARS-CoV-2 are markedly under expressed in individuals with LOY (SLPI, IFI6, IFIT1, IFIT3, and IFI44L) (Figure 3B-D). Secretory leukocyte protease inhibitor (SLPI) is a regulator of innate and adaptive immunity that protects the host from excessive inflammation in infectious disease, while the other four genes encode interferon induced proteins of the innate immune system that participate in the immediate host response to viral infections 28 . Dysfunctions of the adaptive immunity and interferon-mediated immediate host response in individuals with XCM/LOY are consistent with the observed sexual dimorphism in human immune system aging, and might underlie a poor immune response to SARS-CoV-2 infection.",

B-deviation is calculated for the pseudoautosomal regions 1 and 2 (PAR1, 0-2.5Mb on both Xp and Yp; PAR2, 300kb on distal Xq and Yq, Mb 155 and 59 respectively), and the XY transposed region (88-92Mb on X, 2.5-6.5Mb on Y). The method is calibrated to detect mosaicism when the proportion of affected cells is above 15%.Gene expression data was quantile-normalized to the median. We analyzed linear regression residuals of gene expression data on fourty multidimensional scaling components, to correct for possible unwanted variability. Array quality was assessed using arrayQualityMetricsBioconductor package. genefilter Bioconductor package was used to filter for features without annotation and/or exhibiting little variation and low signal across samples, leaving a total of 15,592 probes from 34,282. Differential expression (DE) between individuals with and without LOY was then performed using limma Bioconductor package. Significant DE genes were considered at false discovery rate (FDR) < 0.05. Significant DE genes at p<0.001 level were selected for Gene Ontology (GO) and KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes) enrichment analysis with clusterProfiler Bioconductor package. Over-representation of DE genes in the gene set obtained from the analysis of SARS-CoV-2 infected cell lines (p<0.001and log-foldchange > 0.5) was performed using exact Fisher test. Cell-type composition of the 43 individuals with bulk transcriptomic data (11 LOY, 32 normal) was estimated using the 'xcell' method implemented in the immunodeconv R package.20",
