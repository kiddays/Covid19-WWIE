For unclear reasons, higher mortality rates from COVID-19 have been reported in men compared to women. While the SARS-CoV-2 receptor ACE2 and serine protease TMPRSS2 have been detected in lung and other tissues, it is not clear what sex differences may exist. We analyzed a publicly-available normal human prostate single-cell RNA sequencing dataset and found TMPRSS2 and ACE2 coexpressing cells in epithelial cells, with a higher proportion in club and hillock cells. Then we investigated datasets of lung epithelial cells and also found club cells co-expressing TMPRSS2 and ACE2. A comparison of ACE2 expression in lung tissue between males and females showed higher expression in males and a larger proportion of ACE2+ cells in male type II pneumocytes, with preliminary evidence that type II pneumocytes of all lung epithelial cell types showed the highest expression of ACE2. These results raise the possibility that sex differences in ACE2 expression and the presence of doublepositive cells in the prostate may contribute to the observed disparities of COVID-19.",

Interestingly, Henry and colleagues recently characterized the prostate club cell [5] as sharing a genetic signature similar to lung club cells [6] . Therefore, in order to better understand the prostate's susceptibility to infection, we compared ACE2 and TMPRSS2 expression in both prostate and lung club cells. We found that 0.61% of prostate club cells co-express ACE2 and TMPRSS2, which correlate with the low numbers of lung club cells with ACE2 and TMPRSS2 co-expression across four human datasets.

We found no significant difference in TMPRSS2 expression between male and female lung epithelial cells. This finding is consistent with another recent report examining the same sex difference [12] . If these findings are reproducible with greater sample sizes, the greater proportion of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 co-expression in male type II pneumocytes may contribute to the associated disparities in COVID-19 pathogenesis.

Whether differences in TMPRSS2 and ACE2 expression mediate SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis and whether androgen signaling can affect COVID-19 disease remain to be studied. Sex differences in TMPRSS2 and ACE2 expression could influence potential sites of disease and viral reservoirs. Sex differences in TMPRSS2 expression alone in the lung may not drive the higher burden of SARS-CoV-2 disease among men. However, our finding that distinct populations of cells in the prostate co-express TMPRSS2 and ACE2 raises the possibility that sex differences could influence COVID-19 disease pathogenesis in males differently than females. Further research into TMPRSS2 expression and its modulation within the lung and other relevant cell types that may impact ACE2 and SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis is needed.",

Gene expression in each dataset was normalized and scaled following the standard Seurat workflow, and sample batch effects were removed using the integration function implemented in Seurat 3.1.4 [16]. Cell distribution in each dataset was visualized in Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP), generated based on the principal component analysis and colorcoded by different cell types annotation from the original study. The Reyfman et al. dataset and the Raredon et al. dataset were integrated following the Seurat 3.1.4 integration workflow to remove the batch effect from different samples and stratified by sex of samples reported in the original studies. Top differentially expressed gene markers were identified using the FindAllMarker function built within Seurat and ranked",
