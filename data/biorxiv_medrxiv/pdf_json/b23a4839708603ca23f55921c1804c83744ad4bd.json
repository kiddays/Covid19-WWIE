Among them, motifs A-F are highly conserved for all viral RdRps, and the motif 141 . CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International license (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder.

The motif C contains 143 the critical 759-SDD-761 catalytic residues which reside in a \u03b2-turn loop connecting two 144 adjacent strands. The motif F forms a finger-tip that protrudes into the catalytic chamber and 145 interacts with the finger extension loops and the thumb subdomain ( Figure 3B ). It has been 146 shown that some sNSV polymerases, e.g. influenza virus and bunyavirus polymerases, require 147 the binding of a conserved 5'-RNA hook to activate the activity for RNA synthesis by The nsp7-nsp8 heterodimer binds above the thumb subdomain of RdRp and sandwiches 159 the finger extension loops in between to stabilize its conformation ( Figure 1B ). This interaction 160 is mainly mediated by the nsp7 within the heterodimer while the nsp8 (nsp8.1) contributes few 161 contacts with the nsp12 polymerase subunit ( Figures 1B and 3D ). The other nsp8 (nsp8.2) 162 subunit clamps the top region of the finger subdomain and forms additional interactions with 163 .

The two nsp8 subunits display significantly different 164 conformations with substantial refolding of the N-terminal extension helix region, which 165 mutually preclude the binding at the other molecular context ( Figure 3C ). The importance of 166 both cofactor-binding sites has been validated by previous biochemical studies on polymerase, which revealed their essential roles for stimulating the activity of nsp12 168 polymerase subunit (Subissi et al., 2014) .

Intriguingly, the SARS-CoV-2 nsp12-nsp7-nsp8 complex displayed 186 a much lower efficiency (~35%) for RNA synthesis as compared to the SARS-CoV counterpart 187 ( Figure 4A ). As all three nsp subunits harbor some residue substitutions between the two 188 viruses, we further conducted cross-combination analysis to evaluate the effects of each subunit 189 on the efficiencies of RNA production. In the context of SARS-CoV-2 nsp12 polymerase 190 subunit, replacement of the nsp7 cofactor subunit with that of SARS-CoV did not result in 191 obvious effect on polymerase activity, whereas the introduction of SARS-CoV nsp8 subunit 192 greatly boosted the activity to ~2.1 times of the homologous combination. Simultaneous 193 replacement of the nsp7 and nsp8 cofactors further enhanced the efficiency for RNA synthesis 194 to ~2.2 times of that for the SARS-CoV-2 homologous complex ( Figure 4B ). Consistent with 195 this observation, the combination of SARS-CoV-2 nsp7-nsp8 subunits with the SARS-CoV 196 nsp12 polymerase subunit compromised its activity as compared to the native cognate cofactors, 197 among which the nsp8 subunit exhibited a more obvious effect than that for nsp7 ( Figure 4C ). 198 These evidences suggested that the variations in nsp8 subunit rendered a significantly negative 199 impact on the polymerase activity of SARS-CoV-2 nsp12. The non-significant effect of nsp7 200 on polymerase activity was quite conceivable as only one residue substitution occurred between 201 the two viruses ( Figure 2B ). In addition, we also compared the polymerase activity of different 202 nsp12 subunits in the same context of nsp7-nsp8 cofactors. Combined with either cofactor sets, 203 the SARS-CoV-2 nsp12 polymerase showed a lower efficiency (~50%) for RNA synthesis as 204 compared to the SARS-CoV counterpart ( Figure 4D ). This observation demonstrated that the 205 residue substitutions in nsp12 also contributed to the reduction of its polymerase activity, with 206 similar impact to the variations in the nsp8 cofactor. 207 .

To test this hypothesis, we measured the binding kinetics between 214 different subunits of the two viruses by surface plasmon resonance (SPR) assays. Each 215 interaction pair exhibited similar kinetic features for the two viruses, all with sub-micromolar 216 range affinities ( Figure 5A and B). We also tested the cross-binding between subunits of the 217 two viruses, which revealed similar affinities for heterologous pairs as compared to the native 218 homologous interactions ( Figure 5C and D) .

            "text": "34 virus 2\" (SARS-CoV-2) by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) 35 (Coronaviridae Study Group of the International Committee on Taxonomy of, 2020). The 36 pneumonia disease was named coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) by world health 37 organization (WHO). The outbreak has developed into a global pandemic affecting most 38 countries all over the world (Holshue et al., 2020; Kim et al., 2020). As of April 19 th , 2020, 39 more than 2,000,000 human infections have been reported worldwide, including over 160,000 40 deaths (https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019). The origin of this 41 virus has not been identified, but multiple origins possibly exist based on the recent 42 bioinformatics analysis of the viral isolates from different countries (Andersen et al., 2020; 43 Zhang and Holmes, 2020). So far, there are no specific drugs or vaccines available yet, which 44 poses a great challenge for the treatment and control of the diseases. 45 SARS-CoV-2 belongs to the family of Coronaviridae, a group of positive-sense RNA 46 viruses with a broad host-spectrum (Vicenzi et al., 2004). Currently, a total of seven human-47 infecting coronaviruses have been identified, among which SARS-CoV-2 displays the highest 48 similarity in genome sequence to the SARS-CoV emerged in 2002-2003 (Zhong et al., 2003; 49 Zhou et al., 2020). Both viruses utilize the same host receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 50 2 (ACE2) for cell entry and cause respiratory symptoms that may progress to severe pneumonia 51 and lead to death (Lu et al., 2020; Zhou et al., 2020). However, as compared to the SARS-CoV, 52",

All of the three structures reported by our 125 group and others' revealed similar structural features, including the partially unresolved N-126 terminal portion of nsp8 and a small C-terminal tail of nsp7 subunits, and allowed the 127 identification of a previously undefined \u03b2-hairpin motif in the N-terminus of nsp12 subunit 128 which binds at the interface between the NiRAN domain and the palm subdomain of RdRp 129 (Figure 2C). However, no extra density for this region was observed in the reconstruction of 130 SARS-CoV polymerase complex (Figure 2D), suggesting the different conformation or 131 flexibility of this motif between the two viruses. Of note, in the structure determined by Gao et 132 al., the N-terminal residues 51-117 of nsp12 subunit were clearly resolved to constitute an 133 almost complete NiRAN domain (Gao et al., 2020).

In the structure 150 of coronavirus polymerase, this finger-tip loop is stabilized by the adjacent finger extension 151 loops which are secured by the interactions with nsp7-nsp8 heterodimer (Figure 1B and C). In 152 the absence of this heterodimer, the finger extension loops displayed significant flexibility as 153 observed in the structure of SARS-CoV nsp12-nsp8 subcomplex, which would thus destabilize 154 the finger-tip motif (Figure S4G and H) (Kirchdoerfer and Ward, 2019). These evidences are 155 consistent with the observation that the nsp12 alone shows extremely weak activity for 156 nucleotide polymerization, whereas this activity is remarkably stimulated upon the binding of 157 nsp7-nsp8 cofactors (Ahn et al., 2012; Subissi et al., 2014).158",

Consistent with the almost identical sequences, the nsp7 of both 221 viruses displayed comparable melting behaviors in the circular dichroism (CD) profiles, 222 demonstrating similar thermostabilities of the two proteins (Figure 6A and D). In contrast, both 223 the nsp8 and nsp12 subunits of SARS-CoV-2 showed lower melting temperature (Tm) values 224 as compared to the corresponding subunits of SARS-CoV, suggesting the poorer 225 thermostability of SARS-CoV-2 proteins (Figure 6B, C, E and F). 226 Taken together, the residue substitutions in SARS-CoV-2 nsp12 polymerase subunit and 227 nsp7-nsp8 cofactors compromise the efficiency of RNA synthesis by the core polymerase 228 complex and reduce the thermostability of individual protein subunits as compared to the 229 SARS-CoV. These changes may indicate the adaptive evolution of SARS-CoV-230 2 towards the human hosts with a relatively lower body temperature than bats which are 231 potentially the natural host of a panel of zoonotic viruses, including both SARS-CoV and 232 SARS-CoV-2 (O'Shea et al., 2014; Zhou et al., 2020). 233 234 Discussion 235 The structural information of coronavirus polymerase interaction with cofactors suggests a 236 common theme of viral RdRp activation despite being executed by different structural 237 components. The coronavirus polymerase subunit requires multiple cofactors/subunits for 238 complete transcription and replication functions, similar to the related flaviviruses which also 239 harbor a positive-sense RNA genome (Aktepe and Mackenzie, 2018; Sevajol et al., 2014; 240 Ziebuhr, 2005). In contrast, the sNSVs utilize fewer multi-subunit protein components to 241 accomplish similar processes, which could be activated by RNA segments instead of proteins 242 (Gerlach et al., 2015; Peng et al., 2020; Pflug et al., 2014). As revealed by the coronavirus core 243 polymerase structures, it lacks the essential component for unwinding the template-product 244 hybrid which is required to release the single-strand mRNA and viral genome for protein 245 expression and virion assembly. In the structure of sNSV polymerases, a lid domain is present 246 at the intersection region of template and product exit tunnels to force duplex deformation 247 before leaving the polymerase chamber (Gerlach et al., 2015; Peng et al., 2020; Reich et al., 248 2014). The nsp13 subunit has been shown with RNA helicase activity, suggesting its 249 involvement in RNA synthesis at the post-catalytic stage (Adedeji et al., 2012). Further 250investigations are required to understand how this process takes place. note, we demonstrate the amino acid substitutions in the polymerase and cofactors of 252 SARS-CoV-2 lead to obviously reduced activity for RNA synthesis as compared to SARS-CoV 253 core polymerase complex. Indeed, these observations are based on partial components of the 254 multiple-subunit holoenzyme for coronavirus replication which also involves proofreading and 255 capping by other nsp subunits, e.g. the nsp10-nsp14 exonuclease subcomplex, nsp13 RNA 5'-256 triphosphatase, and the nsp14 and nsp16 methyltransferases(Sevajol et al., 2014; Ziebuhr,  257    2005). These steps would also render important determinants for the efficiency and accuracy258 of RNA synthesis by coronavirus replication machinery. Thus, the collective behavior of 259 SARS-CoV-2 polymerase complex in the context of an authentic viral replication cycle still 260 remains an open question to be further explored. On the other hand, the lower thermostability 261 of SARS-CoV-2 polymerase subunits indicate its well adaptation for humans which have a 262 relatively lower body temperature compared to bats, the potential natural host of SARS-CoV-263 2 (O'Shea et al., 2014; Zhou et al., 2020). Interestingly, we also found that the closely-related 264 bat coronavirus RaTG13 showed an extremely high sequence identity of core polymerase 265 subunits to SARS-CoV-2, in which the nsp7 and nsp8 cofactors are strictly identical and the 266 nsp12 catalytic subunit harbors only four residue replacements between the two viruses (Figure 267",

This observation indicated the RaTG13 coronavirus has been well adapted to 269 human hosts in terms of viral replication machinery and might further support the probable bat-270 origin of SARS-CoV-2 (Zhou et al., 2020). 271 In summary, our structural and biochemical analyses on SARS-CoV-2 core polymerase 272 complex improve our understanding on the mechanisms of RNA synthesis by different viral 273 highlight a common theme for polymerase activation by stabilizing critical catalytic 274 motifs via diverse means. In addition, the different biochemical properties of polymerase 275 components of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV suggest the clues for adaptive evolution of 276 coronaviruses in favor of human hosts.

The nsp12 474 protein was immobilized on the chip with a concentration of 100 \u03bcg/mL (diluted by 0.1 mM 475 NaAc, pH 4.0), and the nsp7 protein was immobilized with a concentration of 50 \u03bcg/mL (diluted 476 by 0.1 mM NaAc, pH 4.5). For all measurements, the same running buffer was used which 477 consists of 20 mM HEPES, pH 7.5,150 mM NaCl and 0.005% tween-20. Proteins were pre-478 exchanged into the running buffer by SEC prior to loading to the system. A blank channel of ",
