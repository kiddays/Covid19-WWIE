In this Original Research article, we describe the conception, the analytical and clinical performances as well as the risk management of implementing the COVID-19 Ag Respi-Strip in a diagnostic decision algorithm. Materials and Methods: Development of the COVID-19 Ag Respi-Strip resulted in a readyto-use ICT assay based on a membrane technology with colloidal gold nanoparticles using monoclonal antibodies directed against the SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 highly conserved nucleoprotein antigen. Four hundred observations were recorded for the analytical performance study and thirty tests were analysed for the cross-reactivity study. The clinical performance study was performed in a retrospective multi-centric evaluation on aliquots of 328 nasopharyngeal samples. COVID-19 Ag Respi-Strip results were compared with qRT-PCR as golden standard for COVID-19 diagnostics.",

In the clinical performance study performed in three different clinical laboratories we found an overall sensitivity and specificity of 57.6% and 99.5% respectively with an accuracy of 82.6%. The cut-off of the assay was found at Ct<22.

All samples were nasopharyngeal swabs in viral transport medium. The analysis protocol with the COVID-19 Ag Respi-Strip was as follows: of the 20 positive patient samples with Cycle threshold (Ct) below 25, ten of them were analysed in duplicate; of the 20 weakly positive samples with 25<Ct<37.7 all were analysed in duplicate; and of the 20 negative patient samples, ten of them were analysed in duplicate. Duplicate specimen were randomly chosen. For these 100 analyses, 4 observers delivered a qualitative result, resulting in 400 observations. The diagnostic efficacy of the COVID-19 Ag Respi-Strip was evaluated comparing the results with those previously obtained on fresh nasopharyngeal samples tested for SARS-COV-2 with the reference qRT-PCR test (13, slightly adapted in NRC). Regarding the qRT-PCR reference test, total nucleic acid was extracted using NucliSens extraction on easyMAG (BioM\u00e9rieux, Lyon, France), followed by addition of a Phocine Distemper Virus (PDV) internal control (IC) (14). PCR amplification was performed on QuantStudio Dx (Thermo Fisher Scientific), using slightly adapted E-gene primers and probe (13). After the run, amplification plots were analyzed and interpreted using QuantStudio Test Development Software (version 1.0, Thermo Fisher Scientific).",

A proposal for a legal framework has been drafted, closely relating the GP to a clinical laboratory to guarantee traceability within a recognized quality management system and certification of competent users after training. Secondly, regarding the biosecurity rules for handling COVID-19 suspicious respiratory samples, and the absence of a Biological Safety Cabinet Class II at the GP's office, the GP should possess all protection material like a biohazard bin, sterile gloves, a disposable lab coat, lab glasses and a FFP2 mask. Third, in this study, we did not record how many COVID-19 Ag Respi-Strips gave weak intensities for the control and test lines. But in our User friendly study, the observers mentioned a source of error when reading weakly positive COVID-19 Ag Respi-Strip due to the difficulty to visualize the colour line through the closed tube. To better visualize the strip when good light (such as with Crystal tubes) is not available, the lab technician had sometimes to open the test tube in the laminar air flow cabinet and pull out the strip with forceps. This type of operation would never be acceptable in a GP environment. At this point, the design of the device is a strip into a closed reaction tube, but R&D will continue to improve its maturity, with the perspective of a closed cassette including closed sample handler enhancing visualisation of the test line and reducing the risk of user error in interpretation of the results.

Aliquots of these patient samples were analysed with COVID-19 Ag Respi-Strip and compared to the qRT-PCR result. At the laboratory LHUB-ULB, viral RNA extraction was performed by QIAsymphony DSP Virus/Pathogen Kit (QIAGEN) which extracted 400\u00b5l sample eluted in 60\u00b5l elution buffer for the Mini Kit and 800\u00b5l sample eluted in 110\u00b5l buffer for the Midi Kit, or by m2000 mSample Preparation SystemDNA Kit (Abbott) using 1000\u00b5l manually lysed sample (700\u00b5l sample + 800\u00b5l lysis buffer from kit) eluted in 90\u00b5l elution buffer. A qRT-PCR internal control was added at each extraction. qRT-PCR was performed using 10\u00b5l of extracted sample in the RealStar\u00ae SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR Kit from altona-diagnostics with a cut-off set at 40 Ct. The RT-PCR protocol used in Liege for the comparison was as follow: RNA was extracted from clinical samples (300\u00b5L) on a Maxwell 48 device using the Maxwell RSC Viral TNA kit (Promega). Reverse transcription and RT-PCR were performed on a LC480 thermocycler (Roche) based on Charit\u00e9's protocol for the detection of RdRp and E genes (16) using the Taqman Fast Virus 1-Step Master Mix (Thermo Fisher).",

The crossreactivity for S. aureus in sputum, which isn't the prescribed sample type for COVID-19 diagnostics and moreover has unknown matrix interference, gave one false positive test result.On the contrary, in all weakly and strongly positive SARS-CoV-2 observations with the nasopharyngeal samples of UZ Leuven, no false positive result has been detected with the COVID-19 Ag Respi-Strip (N=0/108).",
