First, there is clear underreporting of infection in this critical population as CDC data indicate that 84% of all reported U.S. COVID cases had no information on HCW status 9 . Second, among both HCW and non-HCW (NHCW), access to testing has been inconsistent in the U.S., and a large proportion of cases that are asymptomatic or have only mild symptoms are likely to have gone untested 10, 11 . Importantly, asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic individuals can still transmit the virus and may represent the population most likely to spread the infection [12] [13] [14] . The rapid spread of the disease and high clinical demands on the HCW population during the pandemic have impaired efforts to prospectively and systematically study the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in U.S. HCWs. These data are vitally important to understand potential sources of exposure as well as to inform clinical decision-making about staffing and protections for HCW and their patients.",

While HCW were slightly more likely than NHCW to report sick contacts outside of work, fewer than 1 in 5 HCW reported having a sick contact. SARS-CoV-2-infected HCW appeared more likely to be nurses, to spend more time in patients' rooms, and to have more patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19.

With its proximity to New York City (NYC), NJ is one of the states hardest hit by COVID-19 crisis to date: home to less than 3% of the U.S. population 18 , it has over 75,000 confirmed COVID-19 cases, representing 11.7% of all known cases nationwide 17, 19 . The first confirmed COVID positive case in NJ was reported on March 3, 2020. On March 9, the governor declared a state of emergency followed soon after by a statewide curfew (March 16) and stay-at-home order (March 21). At the time our recruitment began on March 24, 2020, 3,675 cases had been reported in NJ, second only to New York; as of the time of writing (April 17), there are over 75,000 confirmed cases in the state indicating the ongoing magnitude of the crisis 17 . Compared to Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital situated in Central NJ (Middlesex County), the infection rate among HCW was nearly 3.5 times higher at University Hospital Newark, an urban hospital situated close to NYC (Essex County) with higher population density and higher rates of infections, as well as a higher proportion of hospitalized patients with COVID-19. The difference in infection rates detected among HCW at these two hospitals highlights the variability across hospitals even within the same medical system and the need for more research on COVID-19 in HCW across diverse healthcare settings.",

In our cohort, slightly higher proportions of HCW versus NHCW reported recent COVID-19 symptoms or sick contacts with COVID-19 diagnoses or symptoms, raising the possibility of ascertainment bias. However, simultaneous enrollment and testing of NHCW in the same locations and timeline, and the low overall prevalence of recent symptoms or exposures among both HCW and NHCW minimized this source of bias. Despite biases that could have raised the rates of detected infections, in fact 95% of the cohort were uninfected. We cannot definitively identify the exposures leading to infection or rule out HCW infections transmitted from sources other than hospitalized patients, including asymptomatic colleagues or contacts outside the hospital 13 . The hospital with higher rates of infected HCW had both higher rates of infected patients within the facility as well as higher rates of infections in the surrounding area. However, infected HCW appeared to spend more time in patients' rooms and care for more patients with COVID-19, and HCW were considerably more likely than NHCW to be infected, suggesting possible infectious transmission within the hospital. Planned longitudinal follow-up in this cohort will provide novel incidence and exposure data. Finally, the small numbers of SARS-CoV-2 diagnoses limited statistical comparisons.",

We observed higher rates of infection among nurses, in those caring for more patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19, and in the hospital with a higher proportion of patients with COVID-19. Lower rates of PPE use did not appear to correspond to higher rates of infection. Most infected participants reported no symptoms of COVID-19 and had no known sick contacts outside of the workplace. Additional strategies are needed to protect these critical frontline workers and to identify deficiencies in current protections. This prospective HCW cohort provides the baseline data to study the incidence and other risk factors of SARS-CoV-2 infection in this crucial population as the pandemic advances. .
