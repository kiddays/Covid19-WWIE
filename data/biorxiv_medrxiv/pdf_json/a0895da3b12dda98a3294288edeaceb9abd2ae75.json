            "text": "Our findings suggest that the multiple control measures adopted in Sri Lanka during March 233 2020, which includes prompt contact tracing and isolation, border closure and complete 234 lockdown, have enabled reduction in transmission from an initial level (R=3.0) that would 235 have almost certainly overwhelmed Sri Lanka's health system within a month, peaking in 236 about 3 months, with well over 5 million active infections at that point. 237The simple SIR model we developed enables visualization of how different levels of control 238 would affect the speed at which ICU capacity in our country reaches saturation and the 239 number of cases that would signal the likelihood of this occurring in 2-3 months. Our 240 projections suggest that transmission should be controlled so that R does not exceed 1.5 for 241 any prolonged length of time, in order to avoid overloading the ICU capacity. The model can 242 also be used to envisage the impact of varying levels of control in different areas within Sri 243Lanka, such as in the 6 districts in Sri Lanka categorized as having a high risk of transmission 244 compared to the other 19 districts which have a lower risk. This could inform healthcare 245 decision making at a more local level. 246It may be argued that the SIR model is not applicable in the Sri Lankan context, because there 247 is, as yet, no full-blown community transmission. However, it is likely that the COVID-19 248 epidemic in Sri Lanka will move into this phase, as has happened in many other countries 249 over the past three months, and the SIR model is widely accepted as a means of 250 conceptualizing the spread of an infectious disease through a population over time (10). 251The validity of the projections derived from our model depend a great deal on the accuracy of 252 the assumed parameters, such as the proportion of asymptomatic individuals, the average 253 period of infectiousness, the proportion of symptomatic individuals who require ICU care, the 254 duration of ICU stay, etc. The estimates presented here are based on data reported from other 255 countries where the epidemic is more advanced, and may not necessarily be appropriate in 256 .
