[An introductory description of the recent work on data analysis and modeling of COVID-19 is presented in Supplementary Note (SN) 1.] In this paper, we meet this challenge by developing a coupled, dual-system spreading model. In particular, to predict the epidemic trend for any specific target State in the US, we treat the target system (A) as one under influences from another, much larger system (B) that represents all the other States. Because the size of B is much larger than that of A, in terms of the spreading dynamics, system B can be regarded as a closed system. From the standpoint of nonlinear physics, the influences of system B on system A can be viewed as a perturbation or background noise, while the effects of A on B can be neglected. The perturbation can be estimated based on the population of the target State and the empirical human movement data. The backbone of this unidirectionally coupled system is our recently developed, non-Markovian, five-state spreading model incorporating various time delays that are characteristic of COVID-19, which has been demonstrated to have the power to accurately predict the epidemic trends in China, South Korea, Italy, Iran, and the United Kingdom [24]. We select ten representative States in the US and aim to predict, for each State, how two key parameters affect the size of the final infected population and the epidemic duration: one characterizing the testing capability of the State, which essentially determines the fraction of undocumented infected population, and another quantifying the strength of the government actions. Using the daily number of confirmed cases up to March 29 to estimate the basic parameters, the model can generate a number of distinct epidemic trajectories into the future for each State.

As of April 16, there had been over 641,000 cases and over 31,000 deaths. This development is rather astonishing, considering that there were only a few confirmed cases two months ago, when a massive outbreak in China had occurred. In fact, from the end of January, for various reasons the number of reported cases in the US increased quite slowly for a stretched period of time. The onset of an exponential increase in the US occurred in the middle of March, where it became apparent that COVID-19 began the phase of community spreading. In response, the White House issued a nationwide social-distancing order on March 16. Statewide stay-at-home or shelter-in-place orders were given by the governors of various States at different time (at the time of writing, there are still seven States that have not issued such an order). To quantitatively predict the effectiveness of the federal and State government measures to control COVID-19 spreading in the United States is utterly urgent. (Here we use \"State\" to denote a State in the US to distinguish it from a \"state\" as in an epidemic state.)",

A quantitative assessment of the effects of the control measures taken by the government to contain the COVID-19 pandemic thus needs to be carried out on a State-by-State basis.

The predicted scenarios vary among the States and they are indicative of whether testing services and control measures are vigorous enough to fully contain the spreading of COVID-19. Systematic simulations reveal that, while sufficient testing can be beneficial, the control measures play a more important role in suppressing the epidemic, where strict government actions can reduce the epidemic duration and size in an exponential manner. An alarming result is that the length of the epidemic duration can differ by as much as one year among the States, posing a grave challenge to the government efforts in suppressing the pandemic and implying the continuous need for long-term and vigorous enforcement of the current control measures. RESULTS We present prediction results from our generalized, dual coupled system, five-state model (described in Methods) for ten States: New York (the current epicenter), Washington (the previous epicenter), New Jersey, California, Michigan, Florida, Illinois, Massachusetts, Louisiana, and Arizona. (Source of data -Center for Systems Science and Engineering at Johns Hopkins University [25] ). State-wise, up to March 29, the first nine States in this list had the top nine largest numbers of confirmed cases among the 50 States. The last State in the list, Arizona, is the home State of one of the co-authors. We use the daily number of confirmed cases up to March 29 to estimate the model parameters. For each State, we generate a number of epidemic scenarios and use the empirical data after March 29 to determine the most likely one(s). Detailed results for Arizona, Washington, and New York are described below, while the results for the remaining seven States are presented as SNs. In all the cases, each State is an open system with the influences of the rest of the country treated as a perturbation. Predictions of the epidemic trend of the entire country are also included as an SN. (Because the US is effectively a closed system, in this case the generalized coupling model is not necessary; instead, the single system, five-state model that we have developed recently [24] suffices.) For quantitatively assessing the effects of interstate travel on the epidemic through comparison, we also include results from the closed system model for two States: New York and Arizona.",

Quantitatively, for any State, the collective effects of these measures can be described by two parameters: the exponential decay rates of the activities associated with interstate and intrastate travel, denoted by l inter and l intra , respectively, where a larger rate corresponds to more stringent control measures. The values of the two parameters characterizing the control measures can be estimated based on the available epidemic data [24] . Another key parameter is the fraction of undocumented infections, denoted as h, the role of which in the COVID-19 epidemic has been studied recently in the framework of the closed system, five-state model [24] .

For comparison, we also simulate the hypothetical case of more strict control measures: l = 0.24. To set the possible values of h for New York and other States in the US, we note that in China, due to the widespread government actions with extensive and sufficient testing and surveillance capabilities, most cases of infection were claimed to have been detected and reported, leading to an extremely low value of h: h = 0.012 as reported by the Chinese government (a recent work [26] reporting a substantial fraction of undocumented infections based on data from the early phase of the epidemic in China notwithstanding).

We thus simulate two situations: h = 0.5 and 0.8. Taken together, for each of the ten States and the US as a whole, we carry out systematic simulations for four combinations of (h, l): (0.5, 0.18), (0.5, 0.24), (0.8, 0.18), and (0.8, 0.24). We focus on the time evolution of three quantities that are the key dynamical variables of our coupled five-state model (Methods): (i) the population of the individuals in the \"hidden\" state who have been infected but who are asymptomatic or show only mild symptoms, denoted as H(t), (ii) the population of infected individuals who show clear symptoms, denoted as I(t), and (iii) the population of confirmed individuals, denoted as J(t). In general, H(t) and I(t) exhibit a \"humped\" structure: with time they increase from zero, reach a maximum, and then decay to zero. The inflection point occurs when I(t) reaches maximum, and the epidemic is deemed over when I(t) has approached zero. The number of confirmed cases, J(t), is a non-decreasing function of time and reaches a constant value as I(t) approaches zero. The epidemic duration is measured by the date on which the H-state and I-state populations reach zero. The epidemic size can be characterized by the constant value of the final number of confirmed cases. To make quantitative predictions, it is necessary to have the values of the initial number of individuals in the hidden state and the infection rate, i.e., the probability for an individual in the susceptible state to switch to the H state, which can be estimated through an optimization procedure [24] . The values of the two parameters so obtained are denoted as H \u21e4 (0) and b \u21e4 .",

Figure 2 shows four distinct epidemic scenarios. In particular, Fig. 2 (a) shows that, for h = 0.5 and l = 0.18, the inflection point will occur on about April 3 with the peaked infected population of about 8,000. The epidemic will last through August 2 and the final number of confirmed cases will be about 13,000.

Now suppose a more restrictive set of measures: l = 0.24. In this case, the inflection point will occur on April 2. Comparing with the case in Fig. 2 (b), we see that the peak I value of 8,500 represents only a small increase, and the epidemic duration will be about one month longer (ending date on July 3) with 12,500 confirmed cases.",

Another result is that the epidemic scale of this early epicenter is projected to be at least one order of magnitude smaller than that of the current epicenter New York. Figure 3 presents the predicted outcomes of four scenarios. In Fig. 3(a) , the fraction of undocumented infection is 50% (h = 0.5) and the control measures imposed by the State government are relatively less stringent (l = 0.18). In this case, the inflection point will occur around April 8 when the infected population I(t) is peaked at the value of approximately 300,000. Because the mean time delay from I state to J state is set as seven days, the population of newly confirmed patients will be peaked around April 15, the epidemic will be over on about November 21, and the final number of confirmed cases would be about 550,000. In Fig. 3(b) , h is still 50% but more stringent control measures are assumed: l = 0.24. In this case, the inflection point will occur on about April 5 with the peaked value of I(t) about 240,000.

This is due to a highly localized or \"singular\" behavior: most infections in the State have occurred in New York City. Indeed, if we treat New York City as an independent \"State\" system, a good match between some predicted scenario(s) and the empirical data arises. Detailed results are presented in SN 3. Because of the severity of the epidemic in New York, it is of interest to assess the impact of control measures in a systematic manner. Because these measures are imposed by the State government, we consider the State of New York and calculate the epidemic duration and the final sizes of the three key populations versus l. Figure 4 (a) shows, for h = 0.5, the epidemic ending date versus l. It can be seen that strengthening the measures can lead to an exponential shortening in the duration of the epidemic. The corresponding results for h = 0.8 are shown in Fig. 4(b) . Figures 4(c) and 4(d) show, for h = 0.5 and h = 0.8, respectively, the peak H and I populations as well as the final size J of the confirmed cases versus l, where more stringent government measures can lead to an exponential decrease in the final size of the confirmed population. In terms of specific numbers, a loose set of control measures, e.g., l = 0.16, will result in 800,000 (h = 0.5) or 1.1 million (h = 0.8) confirmed cases for the State of New York. However, a stringent set of measures, say l = 0.28, would reduce the corresponding number to about 300,000 for both h = 0.5 and h = 0.8. That is, if the government measures are sufficiently strict, the size of the tested population becomes an insignificant factor determining the epidemic trend.",

To address this question, we simulate the closed five-state model for the State of New York and compare the results (SN 4) with those in Fig. 3 . We find that the population movements have relatively small effects on the occurrence time of the inflection point and the peak value of the I-state population, but can have a dramatic effect on the epidemic duration and the final size. For example, for h = 0.8 and l = 0.18, the population movements can make the duration four months longer but can reduce the final size of the confirmed population by about 15,000. This means that, without a complete lockdown of the entire State of New York, the travelers out of the State will spread the virus to the rest of the country, leading to a prolonged epidemic duration for the US and the State itself. This conclusion is also supported by simulation results of the closed model but for the entire country (SN 5), which demonstrate a similar epidemic trend as that of New York for every parameter setting tested. The implication is that, while COVID-19 has already begun to spread in other States throughout the country, a complete lockdown of the epicenter would still be beneficial or even necessary. Merely practicing social distancing and imposing stay-at-home order are not sufficient!",

Unlike countries such as China where the orders of the central government are uniformly and strictly followed in the entire country, there is vast heterogeneity among the States in the US in terms of population movements and the government restriction orders, leading to drastically varying epidemic dynamics in different States. As a result, prediction of the COVID-19 epidemics in the US needs to be done in a State-by-State manner. A complication is that, because of the daily interstate population movements, each individual State is effectively an open system, rendering inapplicable the recently developed non-Markovian model for a closed system [24] .

In particular, for any given State, we have used the daily number of confirmed cases up to March 29 to estimate the two key model parameters: the initial population of hidden state and the infection rate, enabling the model to generate possible epidemic trajectories into the future. Comparing the trajectories with the available data up to the time of writing (April 12) allows us to identify the most likely epidemic scenario(s) for the State. For all ten States except the State of New York, at least one such epidemic scenario can be identified. The difficulty with New York State has been resolved by noting the existence of a singular and highly localized spot: New York City, into which vast majority of the cases in the State fall, generating an exceptionally high degree of heterogeneity in the State and rendering inaccurate model prediction of the entire State. The situation is similar to attempting to predict the possible epidemic scenarios for the entire country of USA, which is not feasible due to the highly heterogeneous pattern of outbreaks. Indeed, simulation of New York City alone as an independent system has generated two most likely scenarios that match with the data. The difficulty with New York State and our successful resolution have thus provided further justification for the State-by-State prediction approach. All these results have not only validated our model, but also demonstrated its predictive power. The most likely epidemic scenario(s) for any given State is (are) indicative of whether testing services and control measures are vigorous enough to fully contain the spreading of COVID-19, providing guidance for improvement.",

We have reported results from model predictions of the ten States that differ in their testing and surveillance capabilities. The measures imposed by the States to control COVID-19 also vary, which can be characterized by the exponential rates of reduction in the interstate and intrastate human activities. Our finding is that, with insufficient testing capability leading to a larger fraction of undocumented cases (e.g., 80% versus 50%) and with strict control measures, the occurrence of the inflection point will be delayed for a few days, the peak infected and documented population will increase by 20%, the epidemic duration will be prolonged for as long as half year, and the final infected population can increase by 70%. However, relaxing the control measures can have more devastating consequences. For example, a loose restriction measure (e.g., social-distancing only without stay-at-home order) can lead to a delay in the occurrence of the inflection point by ten days, a 40% increase in the peak infection, epidemic duration of over one year, and a more than five-fold increase in the size of the final infections (documented or undocumented). Simulation results incorporating uncertainties in the prediction still support the above conclusions (SN 13). We also find that imposing intrastate movement restriction can suppress exponentially the epidemic in both its duration and size, regardless of the current epidemic trend of the State. A comparison among the predicted scenarios for different States reveals a difference in the occurrence of the inflection point of about ten days but a stretch in the epidemic duration for as long as one year. Especially, simulations treating the State of New York as an open or a closed system reveal that, if the system is open, the final confirmed cases would be reduced by 15,000 but the duration can be longer by four months. This is because, a fraction of the reduced infected population in New York would diffuse into other States, making the epidemic of the whole country longer. Interstate travel thus poses a significant threat to States such as Arizona, where the epidemic is much less severe. This suggests the necessity of a complete lockdown of New York, the current epicenter, to significantly shorten the epidemic in the US as a whole. Our findings suggest that the duration of such strict lockdown should be no less than one year.",

Models developed in the past few months [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] 27] provide insights but do not take into account the three features. If the system is closed, it is only necessary to consider the first two features, resulting in a five-state model [24] . Here we generalize the closed-system model to include time dependence. Figure 6 illustrates the generalized model. An individual can be in one of the five states at each time step: susceptible (S), hidden (H), infected (I), confirmed and isolated (J), and removed (R). The states S, I, and R have the same meanings as in the classical SIR model for infectious disease, but states H and J are unique for COVID-19. In particular, an individual in H has had the virus and is infectious but is asymptomatic or only mildly symptomatic, in contrast to the I state in which individuals show symptoms. The J state contains individuals who are confirmed with COVID-19. Note that, individuals in the I or J state are quarantined or hospitalized, so the probability for them to infect others can be neglected. Individuals in the R state, by definition, are not infectious. Thus, only the H individuals are capable of infecting others [24] .",

            "text": "There have been focused recent efforts in predicting the epidemic trends of COVID-19 and the effects of government control measures through mathematical modeling . For example, two control strategies, one focusing on mitigation and another on suppression, were studied and compared [11] with the conclusion that, in the United Kingdom, even some best and optimal mitigation measures can lead to a two-thirds reduction in the demand for medical diagnosis and treatment and a 50% decrease in the number of deaths, the epidemic would still result in hundred thousands deaths and overwhelm the intensive care system. The suggestion is that, even for countries whose health care systems are still functional at the present, the strategy of suppression should be given a higher priority. Another work studied the epidemic risks and trends in different cities in Spain [13] through traffic data-driven, stochastic simulations of virus propagation and diffusion in spatial regions and inference of the starting time of the epidemic. The results suggest that finding and isolating the infected individuals at the earliest possible time as well as taking intervention measures to reduce the infection rate are effective strategies. Simulations of traditional mathematical models in epidemiology suggest the benefits of local prevention measures such as forbidding mass social gatherings, pinning down the exposure time as an important factor in disease spreading [14] . For example, if the basic reproduction number is two and the infection period is 14 days, if an infected individual stays at a gathering for more than nine hours, the likelihood of infecting others is high. If the exposure time exceeds 18 hours, the participants in the gathering should take strict measures to protect themselves. The effects of travel restrictions on COVID-19 spreading were studied [15] , with the finding that the lockdown of Wuhan city in China provided a golden time between three and five days for other regions of China to get prepared and, by the middle of February, might have suppressed the scale of global pandemic by as much as 80%. It was suggested that travel restriction in combination with individual prevention measures such as wearing facial masks leading to a reduction in the infection rate by more than 50% can suppress the epidemic. The exponential growth rate in different regions of China in the early stage of COVID-19 epidemic was estimated [16] through a significant level analysis, revealing an approximately uniform value for China: 2.1 \u00b1 0.3 with the finding that effective control strategies leading to dramatic changes in the collective behaviors of the vulnerable population have a direct impact on the growth rate. A network model based on dynamic compartments and the SEIR (susceptible-exposed-infected-recovered) spreading dynamics was articulated [18] to analyze the effects of travel restriction, business closure, and social distancing on the epidemic, with the finding that school closure would shield the youth population from the disease, bar closures would be beneficial to young people and adults alike, and canceling religious services would protect the adults and the elders.",

If the infection rate of COVID-19 is weakened by 25%, the peak would be delayed for about 34 days and its height would be reduced by 39%. Simulations of a model adopted from influenza management suggested [11] the necessity to maintain the control measures until a vaccine becomes available in about 18 months, but socially and economically this would represent a great challenge. Intermittent implementation of social distancing according to epidemic development can allow relaxation of control measures in relatively short time windows: in case a second wave of epidemic begins to emerge, social distancing and family isolation of suspected infections can be put in place again with an increasing intensity. The growth rate and reproductive number of COVID-19 were estimated [22] between March 14 and 19 for different cities in the US, revealing a power law relationship between these quantities and the city population. The implication is that the spreading speed in larger cities will be higher and, without control and prevention measures, a larger fraction of the population would be infected in larger cities. A dynamic model for COVID-19 was proposed [23] for comparing containment strategies in a pandemic scenario that the government can choose: one is a persistent control measure and another is based on adaptive implementation of suppression strategies with intensity depending on time, where the latter can shorten the epidemic duration to a greater extent as compared with the former. In fact, more lives can be saved if strict control measures are implemented earlier.",

This means that, if testing and surveillance are insufficient, the number of confirmed cases reaching zero does not mean the end of the epidemic: there are still a non-negligible number of hidden individuals who carry the virus, are asymptomatic, and can infect others, thereby requiring long term placement of control measures to minimize the rise of a second outbreak.

When a reasonable level of testing is assumed (\u2318 = 0.5), the effects of interstate travel restriction on the epidemic sizes are insignificant [Figs. S5(a) and S5(c)]. However, intrastate travel restriction can have an exponential effect on the epidemic sizes [Figs. S5(b) and S5(d)], similar to its effect on the epidemic duration as described in the main text.",

Also, comparing Fig. S7(b) with Fig. S7(d) reveals that, when the government testing and surveillance services are significantly reduced, insofar as a stringent set of control measures is in place, the resulting epidemic would be worse but to a relatively small extent, unequivocally pointing at the extremely important role of placing vigorous government control measures in suppressing the epidemic. 7 All rights reserved.

Our solution is to resort to the non-parametric bootstrap method [24] and apply it to J(t). The basic assumption is that the data point J(t i ) obeys a normal distribution. The parameter uncertainties can be obtained through multiple sampling of the optimal model. In particular, from the data of confirmed infections J(t 1 ), J(t 2 ), . . . , J(t n ), we first use a least squares fitting to obtain the optimal estimates of the parameters:\u21e5 \u2318 (\u2713 1 ,\u2713 2 ), where\u2713 1 \u2318 and\u2713 2 \u2318 H(0). Let J(t i ,\u21e5) denote the model predicted data set of confirmed infections from the estimated parameter values\u21e5. For the normal distribution of J(t i ,\u21e5) at time t i , its mean is taken to be the actual data point J(t i ) and its standard deviation is approximated by that of the increments in the number of confirmed cases within five days. We then generate S = 10 3 realizations of the data set J(t i ,\u21e5), denoted as J \u21e4 k (t i ,\u21e5) for t = 1, . . . , n and k = 1, . . . , S. For each data realization, the optimal parameter values can be estimated, generating the corresponding prediction results. Repeating this procedure for each of the S data sets gives the prediction ranges for the epidemic quantities of interest.",

From Figs. 5(a) and 5(c), we see that tighter restrictions on the interstate traffic leading to an increase in the value of l inter affect little the occurrence of the inflection point but have some effect on the epidemic duration. Because of the ongoing large scale outbreak in New York, imposing heavier restriction on interstate traffic only has an incremental effect on reducing the duration, as shown in Fig. 5(a). However, for Arizona, because the outbreak is not severe, a stronger restriction on interstate traffic is more effective at shortening the epidemic, as shown in FIG. 5.

Comparing the results for the closed and open system settings, we see that the largest difference occurs for case (c) where testing is insufficient and control measures are not stringent. In this case, the realistic open system will endure a longer epidemic by about 9 days and an increase of about 1200 in the final confirmed cases. For case (d) where testing is insufficient but control measures are more strict, the differences between the closed and open system settings are much less. These results call for vigorous enforcement of government control measures.Supplementary Note 3: Epidemic scenarios in New York City as a closed systemWe simulate four distinct epidemic scenarios for New York City as a closed system with different combinations of testing capability and strength of control measures.

In this case, if New York State is treated as a closed system, the epidemic would end on January 16, 2021. However, in the open system setting, the ending date would be more than four months later: May 30, 2021. This means that, if testing and surveillance are largely insufficient, loose control measures would significantly prolong the epidemic due to interstate travel. Indeed, strict implementation of the control measures would diminish the detrimental effects of interstate travel because the predictions from the closed and open system settings are nearly identical even for lack of sufficient testing, as for case (d). These results further highlight the importance of strict implementation and enforcement of government control and prevention measures, corroborating the results in Figs. 3 and 4 in the main text. 5 All rights reserved.
