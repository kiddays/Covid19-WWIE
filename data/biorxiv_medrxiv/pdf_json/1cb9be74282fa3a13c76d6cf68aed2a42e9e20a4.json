The objective of this paper is to study whether the novel coronavirus has also been associated with an increase in deaths in England and Wales for those who have not contracted the disease. Reasons behind this may include avoiding visits to hospitals or GPs, and the effects of the lockdown. Methods: I used weekly ONS data on the number of deaths that did not involve covid-19 over the period 2015-2020. Simply observing trends is not sufficient as spikes in deaths may occasionally occur. I thus followed a differences-in-differences econometric approach to study whether there was a relative increase in non-covid-19 deaths during the pandemic, compared to a control. As an additional approach, an interrupted time series model was also used. Results: Results suggest that there were an additional 531 non-covid-19 deaths in England and Wales since the outbreak of the pandemic, compared to what would have otherwise been expected [diff-in-diff interaction coeff: 531.11; 95%CI: 125.65 to 936.57]. This is confirmed by the interrupted time series model. Discussion: The health effects of covid-19 do not seem to be limited only to patients suffering from the disease, as the number of deaths for those who did not contract covid-19 has also demonstrated an absolute and relative increase. Analysing the cause of death for non-covid-19 deaths will shed light upon the reasons for the increase in such deaths and will help design appropriate policy responses to save lives.",

In the United Kingdom, the death toll has reached 18,000, while over 130,000 people have been diagnosed with the virus. 1 The novel coronavirus is directly claiming lives, but this unprecedented situation and the lockdown imposed in the UK and other countries might be triggering additional health problems. People with other, unrelated health conditions may be reluctant to visit their GP or a hospital in order to avoid the risk of contracting the virus,2 thus remaining undiagnosed or not receiving the medical treatment they might need. Furthermore, to increase capacity for the overstretched NHS, routine operations have been postponed.3 The lockdown may also have unintended health effects. Lack of social contact can affect mental health,4 and big events or disasters at the national level can have a similar impact.5 Staying at home can limit physical activity, which has been associated with obesity6 and mental health.7",

Instead, I follow an approach similar to that by Metcalfe et al5 who used trends in the same variable, in earlier years, as a control group. Likewise, I used deaths in the first 15 weeks in previous years as a control group for non-covid-19 deaths in the 15 first weeks in 2020. The \"treatment\" period starts in week 10 of the year, when the first covid-19 death occurred in England and Wales.14 In order to compare trends in deaths excluding covid-19 deaths to the control group, I used a difference-in-differences (D-I-D) econometric approach. I used the average number of deaths in the previous five previous years as a control group, which also helps smooth out any short-term spikes (possibly due to a bad flu season15). A difference-in-differences approach requires that the trends (rather than absolute values) in treatment and control groups are parallel .

To test whether this common trend assumption is met, I followed the approach by Autor,16 who used a model with interactions including lags and leads (prior to and after the treatment). Results of the common trend assumption test are presented in Table A1 in the Appendix. All interaction lags are insignificant, suggesting that there is indeed a common trend in the two groups prior to the intervention. Trends can also be observed graphically ( Figure 1 ).",

In other words, deaths of people who suffered from covid-19 are not included in the analysis, in order to study any spillover effects on other deaths. The difference-in-differences model includes a \"treatment group\" dummy variable, which takes the value of 1 for the group that is affected by the intervention, and zero otherwise. In this case, observations in 2020 take the value of 1, and observations in previous years take the value of zero. Another dummy that is included is an \"after\" variable, which takes the value of 1 in the period after an intervention (for both groups, 2020 and other years), and zero otherwise. We consider the treatment period to start in week 10, as that is the week when the first covid-19 death was reported, thus indicating an escalating situation and capturing any spillover effects of the virus. There were four covid-19-related deaths reported in week 10; 35 in week 11; 374 in week 12; 1,704 in week 13; 4,117 in week 14; and 6,146 in week 15. One might argue that the treatment period should start later, when the number of deaths started increasing steeply, but a question that remains is where we should draw the line, and this would possibly relate with the cause of any spillover effects on the number of deaths, which is currently unknownso identifying where the treatment period should start becomes particularly challenging. To be on the safe side, I followed the most conservative approach, i.e. a treatment period that starts with the first death, rather than when .
