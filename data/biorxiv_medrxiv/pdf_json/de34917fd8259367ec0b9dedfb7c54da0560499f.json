It is important for any N95 reuse strategy to determine the effects that proposed protocols would have on the physical functioning of the mask, as well as the practical aspects of implementation. Here we propose and implement a method of heating N95 respirators with moisture (85 \u2022 C, 60-85% humidity). We test both mask filtration efficiency and fit to validate this process. Our tests focus on the 3M 1860, 3M 1870, and 3M 8210 Plus N95 models. After five cycles of the heating procedure, all three respirators pass both quantitative fit testing (score of >100) and show no degradation of mask filtration efficiency. We also test the Chen Heng V9501 KN95 and HKYQ N95 finding no degradation of mask filtration efficiency, however even for unheated masks these scored <50 for every fit test. The heating method presented here is scalable from individual masks to over a thousand a day with a single industrial convection oven, making this method practical for local application inside health-care facilities.",

            "text": "While N95 filtering facepiece respirators (FFRs) were made for single use operation, the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has caused a shortage worldwide of these masks. COVID-19, caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, has been shown to be very contagious and spread through aerosolized droplets. These fine droplets can remain in the air, increasing the risk of contagion to those nearby [1, 2] . This is particularly risky to healthcare workers who work with Covid patients. In order for an N95 mask to be reused more safely, the mask should be decontaminated of SARS-CoV-2 while maintaining its filtration efficiency and fit factor [3, 4] . Currently, limited information is known about SARS-CoV-2 inactivation. Initial data indicate that 70 \u2022 C dry heat for one hour was sufficient to achieve >3 log reduction in SARS-CoV2 on FFRs [5] . The addition of moisture possibly plays a role in the inactivation of some viruses [6] [7] [8] . A study found viral inactivation at 70 \u2022 C for 5 minutes [9] while in a buffered solution. SARS has also been shown to be inactivated at temperatures of 60-75 \u2022 C for 5-30 minutes in various liquid media [10] [11] [12] . Other enveloped viruses, such as H1N1 and H5N1 Influenza strains have been shown to be inactivated with moist heat at 65 \u2022 C and over 50% humidity [6] [7] [8] . These studies also found that dry heat alone was not enough to deactivate H1N1. While previous studies have looked at the effects of moist heat on N95 FFRs, these were done at substantially lower temperatures of 60-65 \u2022 C [6, 8, 13, 14] . We also note that recent CDC (a) (b) (c) Figure. 1 (a) Each N95 FFR (1) was placed into a plastic container with a paper towel (2) with 500 uL of water. Both the mask (3) and container (4) were labeled with a Sharpie black permanent ink marker, which would allow the mask to be identified by the correct healthcare worker and avoid cross contamination. (b/c) For testing purposes, the lid of each container was modified to have a temperature and humidity sensor ((b) SHT30 (c) SHT31).",

The resistance of Clostridium difficile (C. diff.) at elevated temperature and moisture was also studied and found temperatures of 85 \u2022 C resulted in a 5 to 6 log reduction in 15 minutes of heating in a buffer solution [15] . Here we present a scalable method of heating N95 FFRs to 85 \u2022 C, in air, with 60-85% humidity. We note that during the preparation of this manuscript, another study (with some shared co-authors) was posted on medRxiv on the filtration effects of heating under various humidity conditions and for multiple cycles of mask reuse [16] . N95 respirators are typically made of meltblown polypropylene fabric. While this naturally filters out large particles, the efficient filtration of sub-micron sized particles is due to electrostatic charge that is created in the mask fabrication process. If this charge is removed, the mask efficiency plummets, even if there are no visual signs of degradation to the mask. Thus it is critical to run filtration tests on any decontamination procedure.",

The containers are sealed by placing the cover on and then placed in a convection oven (Despatch LAC1-38-8, 3.7 cu. Ft.). We note that a convection oven produces a stable and uniform temperature throughout the oven and heats the masks and containers quickly due to the driven warm airflow. We find that the measured oven temperature is stable to less than 1 \u2022 C regardless of the number of containers we place into this oven (1-45 containers), Figure 2a . It is important to note that a convection oven has no direct line of sight to any radiative heat sources, which would have the potential to damage the masks. For testing purposes, the lids of the containers were modified to allow a temperature and humidity sensor (SHT30 DFR0588 or SEK-SHT31-Sensors 1 ) inside. We found that the humidity will drop rapidly in the presence of a small hole in the lid. The gap between the wires and the lid was thus sealed with 10 minute epoxy with a working temperature of 93 \u2022 C. For temperature verification, we also used both a K type thermocouple (readout with a SR630) and an IR thermometer (Fluke 561). Figure 3 shows the humidity as a function of time within each container for various volumes of water at various temperatures. We also find that the humidity takes between 10-15 minutes to reach the 60% level. This is an important consideration when applying this method as at least 10 additional minutes should be added to the heating cycle to achieve the desired time at target humidity. The temperature rises to within 2 \u2022 C of the target temperature in a similar time.",
