Here we evaluated commercial reagents and assays to detect SARS-CoV-2 131 antigens or RNA in FFPE specimens. We identified one rabbit polyclonal antibody and one 132 mouse monoclonal antibody that reacts with SARS-CoV-2 S and N, respectively, and 133 demonstrated that these two antibodies can be used to detect SARS-CoV-2 by IHC and IFA in 134 FFPE specimens. Additionally, we characterized two RNAscope ISH assays that can be used to 135 detect SARS-CoV-2 positive-and negative-sense RNAs in FFPE specimens. Furthermore, we 136 developed a dual staining assay using IHC and ISH to detect SARS-CoV-2 S and RNA in the 137 same FFPE section. These reagents and assays are all commercially available and therefore can 138 be applied readily to detect SARS-CoV-2 in both human and animal FFPE tissues. 139 Detection of viral antigen by IHC and IFA has been widely used to detect infection of 140 high-consequence viruses, including SARS-CoV, EBOV, MARV, LASV, and NiV in human and 141",
