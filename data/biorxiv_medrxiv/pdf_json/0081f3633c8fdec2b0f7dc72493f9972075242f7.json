During studies of the function of the HSV-1 pUL51 tegument protein we observed cell-117 type-specific localization patterns for pUL51 and, most interestingly, organization into a unitary 118 structure that might correspond to a cVAC in cells of the mouse neuronal CAD cell line. To 119 determine whether this pUL51-containing structure in CAD cells might be a cVAC, we tested the 120 localization of other viral structural proteins. CAD cells were infected with HSV-1(F) at high 121 multiplicity of infection (m.o.i) and co-stained for various tegument and glycoproteins. As shown 122 in Figure 1A , we observed a unitary perinuclear cluster of viral proteins in most cells (Figure 1C ) 123 in which at least six viral structural proteins including pUL11, pUL16, pUL51, gD, gE, and gL 124 were concentrated, suggesting the viral protein cluster might be a cVAC. Note that for these 125 viral proteins, not all of them localize to the putative cVAC at the same efficiency, for example, 126 pUL51 almost exclusively concentrate to the cluster, while most of the gD localizes to the 127 cytoplasmic space or cell membrane. To determine whether a similar structure forms in 128 neuronal cells of human origin, we tested in the same way for formation of the putative cVAC in 129 SH-SY5Y cells, a human cancerous neuronal cell line ( Figure 1B ). As expected, a similar 130 putative cVAC is observed in most cells, albeit at a lower frequency ( Figure 1C ). In addition, 131 unlike in CAD cells, where the putative cVAC is composed of numerous small viral protein 132 puncta ( Figure 1A) , the viral protein cluster in SH-SY5Y cells typically appeared as a collection 133 of several large granules ( Figure 1B) . Together, the localization pattern of viral proteins in both 134 CAD and SH-SY5Y cells is different from it in cells of epithelial origin, such as Vero cells (Figure 135 1D), suggesting that the mode of viral component trafficking is cell context-dependent. 136",

Autophagy leads to 183 the formation of a double-membrane structure called autophagosome, which engulfs cellular 184 components and intracellular pathogens within itself before fusing with lysosomes for 185 degradation (Tanida, 2011, Parzych and Klionsky, 2014) . In mammalian cells, the membranes 186 that form an autophagosome are defined by the incorporation of an autophagy marker LC3 187 to membranes, forming puncta structures ( Figure 4C ). Upon infection, these GFP-LC3 puncta 192",

Reciprocally, in this study, we have shown that pUL51 in HSV is also important for cVAC 545 maintenance, as mutations in HSV pUL51 disrupts cVAC formation ( Figure 10F ). Interestingly, 546 although the hypothetical tyrosine-based trafficking motif in the N-terminus of pUL51 is 547 conserved in several herpesviruses and has been shown to be a cytoplasmic retrieval motif in 548 HCMV homolog pUL71 (Dietz et al., 2018) , it is as yet unclear whether the same holds true for 549 HSV. It is possible that the tyrosine residue at position 19 in pUL51 is indeed a trafficking motif, 550 which upon mutation prevents pUL51 from concentrating to the HSV cVAC and, in turns, causes 551 failure in cVAC formation.

After treatment, 258 both Rab5 and Rab11 no longer concentrated at one single compartment (Figure 6, B, E, H, 259 and L), suggesting Rab5 and Rab11 may be transported toward the centrosome on microtubule 260 motors in CAD and SH-SY5Y cells. 261 In both CAD and SH-SY5Y cells, infection with HSV resulted in Rab11 concentration at the 262 cVAC defined by gE staining (Figure 6, I and M). Furthermore, in CAD cells, Rab 5 appeared to 263 be excluded from the cVAC since no overlapping signal was observed (Figure 6C), whereas in 264 SH-SY5Y cells, Rab5 was distributed throughout the cytoplasm, including the cVAC area 265 (",

When treated with 317 cytochalasin B, uninfected or infected cells round up similarly to nocodazole treated cells, 318 however, HSV cVAC still forms at the same efficiency in infected cells (Figure S2, A-C), 319 suggesting HSV cVAC formation is not actin dependent. 320 pUL51 plays important role in the maintenance of HSV cVAC morphology. A well-321 established literature has described various viral proteins in HCMV that are essential for proper 322 cVAC morphology and viral production, many of which have homologs with similar functions in 323 HSV. HCMV kinase pUL97 and its HSV homolog pUL13 have important functions in viral 324 nuclear egress (Kato et al., 2006, Cano-Monreal et al., 2009, Marschall et al., 2005, Milbradt et 325 al., 2009, Sharma et al., 2015, DeRussy et al., 2016) and have been implied to play role in viral 326 cytoplasmic assembly (Prichard et al., 2005, Goldberg et al., 2011, Eaton et al., 2014, 327 Gershburg et al., 2015). It was shown that the loss of pUL97 in HCMV results in abnormal cVAC 328 formation (Prichard et al., 2005), however, it was unclear whether it was due to the defect in 329 nuclear egress or the defect in cytoplasmic assembly. To test whether the presence of capsid in 330 the cytoplasm is required for HSV cVAC formation, CAD and SH-SY5Y cells were infected with 331an HSV virus lacking the expression of major capsid protein VP5. As shown inFigure 10D, the 332 HSV cVAC still formed, suggesting viral capsid is not required. Since the more profound role of 333 pUL97 in HCMV and pUL13 in HSV is nuclear lamin network disruption(Kato et al., 2006,  334   Sharma et al., 2015, it is also possible that the viral-induced nuclear membrane alteration is 335 required for the formation of HSV cVAC. To test this hypothesis, CAD and SH-SY5Y cells were 336 infected with an HSV virus lacking the expression of pUL34, a subunit of HSV nuclear egress 337 complex (NEC)(Reynolds et al., 2001). Since pUL34 is a protein that is essential for lamin A/C 338 phosphorylation(Bjerke and Roller, 2006), emerin phosphorylation(Leach et al., 2007), and339 nuclear shape alteration (Vu et al., 2016, Bjerke and Roller, 2006), a UL34-null virus should 340",

            "text": "described an HSV infection-induced structure that concentrates at least six viral 361 structural proteins specifically in neuronal cells. While we have only stained for only six viral 362 structural proteins, they represent core components of at least two viral membrane protein 363 complexes, including the fusion complex that is composed of gD, gB and gH/L (Rodger et al., 364 2001) and a cell-cell spread specific complex gE-gI (Johnson and Feenstra, 1987). All of these 365 proteins have been reported to form stable complexes with other HSV structural proteins, and 366 so it seems highly likely that other interacting viral factors including gM (Crump et al., 2004), 367 gK/pUL20 (Lau and Crump, 2015), pUL7 (Roller and Feters, 2015), VP16 (Johnson et al., 368 1984), and VP22 (Farnsworth et al., 2007) also concentrate at the same structure. This is 369 consistent with the hypothesis that the observed structure is a cVAC at which all of the 370 components necessary for cytoplasmic envelopment are organized. Furthermore, almost all 371 capsid envelopment events were observed concentrating to one region located to one side of 372 the nucleus in CAD cells by TEM imaging (Figure 3). These capsids likely correspond to the 373 capsid concentration in UL35-RFP virus infected cells (Figure 3), where is also where all viral 374 proteins concentrate. Similar concentration of viral proteins and envelopment events have also 375 been observed in other viruses that form cytoplasmic assembly centers, such as HCMV and 376 reovirus (Tenorio et al., 2019). 377 While the viral structural proteins that we have tested all concentrate in the neuronal cVAC, 378 none are exclusively localized to this structure, and they vary considerably in the proportion of 379 the protein found there. pUL11 and pUL51 for example are highly concentrated in the cVAC 380 (Figure 1). In contrast, gD, while concentrated in the cVAC is easily detectable on the cell 381 surface and on membranes throughout the cytoplasm (Figure 1). It is unsurprising that all of the 382 structural proteins have some presence outside of the cVAC, since they must be present in fully 383 assembled egressing virions and as biosynthetic intermediates such as integral membrane 384 proteins in the ER. Furthermore, several of the virion envelope glycoproteins contain plasma 385 membrane retrieval motifs in their cytoplasmic tails and are thought to be retrieved from the 386 plasma membrane and arrive at the site of cytoplasmic envelopment through endosomal 387 trafficking (Alconada et al., 1999, Beitia Ortiz de Zarate et al., 2007, Crump et al., 2004).",

This might reflect an early host antiviral response that inhibits virus production, or it may 402 represent a virus-induced alteration in lysosome organization to promote replication. 403 The formation of a unique cVAC has not previously been reported in HSV infection, but appears 404 to be a constant feature of infection of neuronal cells, as we have observed the cVAC structure 405 in at least two cancerous neuronal cell lines, one of murine origin and one of human origin, and 406 in primary mouse neurons. While it would be of great interest to observe whether a cVAC 407 structure forms in human trigeminal neurons during a natural oral infection as well, such clinical 408 samples would be rare and it is not known how large a subset of these neurons undergo lytic 409 infection (Held and Derfuss, 2011). 410 Since a single HSV cVAC does not form in infected epithelial cells, and since, within the mixed 411 culture of primary neural cells, only neurons, but not astrocytes, allow the formation a cVAC 412 (Figure 2), it is likely that formation of a single cVAC is a specific viral adaptation for infection of 413 neurons. Also, despite that HSV forms cVAC in both CAD and SH-SY5Y cells, there exists 414 considerable variations in their morphology (Figure 1), which suggests the importance of host 415 factors that may vary between human and mouse species or between different neuronal 416 subsets. One factor that might have contributed to the difference between HSV assembly 417 compartment in neurons and epithelial cells is cell polarity. In epithelial cells, cell polarity follows 418 the apical-basolateral axis, while the cell polarity in neurons follows the axon (Bartolini and 419 Gundersen, 2006, Bonifacino, 2014). Since HSV capsids and vesicles that are positive for viral 420 structural proteins move along the microtubule network (Kratchmarov et al., 2012), it is possible 421 that these viral components, despite being transported in the same manner along microtubules, 422 are trafficked to distinct compartments, such as basolateral side in epithelial cells and 423 centralized compartment at cell body in neurons, due to specific cell polarity. Similarly, another 424 was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder. All rights reserved. of HSV assembly compartment difference is the availability of host microtubule 425 components in neurons. This includes as least three non-mutually exclusive aspects: (i) the lack 426 of factors for non-centrosomal microtubule nucleation site in neurons. It was described that 427 Golgi membrane can anchor microtubule minus end and serve as a MTOC in several types of 428 somatic cells (Sanchez and Feldman, 2017), and indeed, in HCMV-infected cells, microtubules 429 preferentially polymerize from Golgi-derived membranes instead of the centrosome (Procter et 430 al., 2018). Since there has been no evidence hitherto suggesting that such alternative MTOC 431 sites can occur efficiently in mammalian neurons (Sanchez and Feldman, 2017), it is possible 432 that the deficiency or absence of alternative microtubule nucleation factor necessitates the 433 centrosome as the viral assembly site in neurons, hence the unitary cVAC. (ii) Different 434 expression level or distribution of certain dynein components or cargo adaptors. Higher 435 eukaryotes encode several isoforms of dynein intermediate and light chains, which are 436 important for cargo specificity (Pfister et al., 2006, Dixit et al., 2008). Also, is has been described 437 that the same trafficking motif of the same protein might utilize different adaptor protein subunits 438 in neurons and epithelial cells (Bonifacino, 2014, Farias et al., 2012). It is possible that viral 439 tegument and glycoproteins can only utilize a certain subset of these dynein motors or cargo 440 adaptors, which in neurons only provides trafficking towards the centrosome while in epithelial 441 cells provides diverse trafficking destinations. (iii) The centrosome in neuronal cells is resistance 442 to viral manipulation. It has been observed that in HSV-infected epithelial cell, centrosome 443 disappears in many cells (Pasdeloup et al., 2013), while in most infected neuronal cells, the 444 centrosome appears to be intact (Figure 3, 7, 9, S2). It is possible that dispersed assembly 445 compartments of HSV in epithelial cells is caused by the loss of centrosome, while in neurons, 446 the stability of the centrosome allows it to out-compete alternative sites and to serve as the 447 major MTOC, which naturally concentrates all viral structural proteins. 448 The organization of host membranes. The identity of the membrane at which HSV 449 cytoplasmic envelopment occurs in epithelial cells is currently controversial, with evidence 450 supporting both trans Golgi and endosomal membranes, but not ER (Lv et al., 2019). The 451 arrangement of host Golgi, ER, and some endosomal membranes in the HSV neuronal cVAC is 452 broadly consistent with previous results derived from epithelial cell studies. ER membranes are 453 not included in the neuronal cVAC (Figure S1). In contrast, cis-and trans-Golgi-derived 454 membranes concentrate to the cVAC but do not completely co-localize with viral structural 455 proteins (Figure 5). This is similar to the previously described localization pattern of Golgi-456 derived membranes in HSV-infected epithelial cells, in which viral capsid and tegument proteins 457 localize adjacent to, and sometimes overlapping with Golgi marker staining (Sugimoto et al., et al., 2012). Hollinshead et al., have shown that some HSV in epithelial cells 459 undergoes envelopment at membranes that are derived from endosomes (Hollinshead et al., 460 2012). Consistent with this idea, we observed concentration of Rab11 endosomes in the cVAC 461 with extensive co-localization between Rab11 and virus structural proteins (Figure 6). 462 Hollinshead and colleagues also showed that Rab5 and Rab11 are important in HSV assembly 463 in HeLa cells (Hollinshead et al., 2012). Rab11 is a recycling endosome marker that has been 464 proposed to play role in the export of HSV cytoplasmic virions (Spearman, 2018, Bucci et al., 465 2014). While concentration of Rab11 at the neuronal cVAC is consistent with a role in virion 466 export, the extensive co-localization between Rab 11 and the viral structural proteins raises the 467 possibility that Rab11 endosomes may be an important site of envelopment. 468 Rab5 is an early endosome marker that, in neurons, retrieves vesicles from both cytoplasmic 469 membrane of the cell body and synaptic membranes from the distal end of axon (Spearman, 470 2018, Bucci et al., 2014). We have observed that Rab5 does not concentrate in the HSV 471 neuronal cVAC, and instead is localized in peripheral puncta, where it co-localizes with some of 472 the cytoplasmic gE (Figure 6C). It is possible that these puncta represent retrieval vesicles that 473 contain viral glycoproteins being trafficked to the cVAC. 474Species specific requirement of microtubule network. The HSV cVAC in cancerous 475neuronal cells forms around the MTOC defined by \u03b3-tubulin staining(Figure 3, 7), suggesting 476 that it is formed and maintained by retrograde transport of membranes and proteins toward the 477 MTOC by microtubule-associated motors. Consistent with this hypothesis, both nocodazole, a 478 microtubule polymerization inhibitor(De Brabander et al., 1976), and ciliobrevin D, a dynein 479 motor ATPase inhibitor(Firestone et al., 2012), are able to disrupt cVAC morphology in CAD 480 cells(Figure 6-9). However, the requirement for an intact microtubule network and, therefore, for 481 a normally formed cVAC for viral assembly in neuronal cell lines is cell-type dependent. 482Nocodazole treatment affects virus production in a dose-dependent manner in SH-SY5Y, but 483 not in CAD cells. This suggests that in CAD cells, despite the dispersal of unitary cVAC around 484 the MTOC, viral proteins are still able to associate with each other to form dispersed, peripheral 485 assembly sites, and indeed we still observed co-localization of the viral structural proteins 486 (Figure 8C). In contrast, in SH-SY5Y cells, tegument proteins and glycoproteins no longer co-487 localize with each other efficiently when microtubule network is disrupted (Figure 8C). The488 mechanistic basis for this discrepancy is unclear, but possibilities include: (i) different 489 sensitivities of the microtubule network to nocodazole. It has been described that herpesviruses 490 can stabilize microtubules via acetylation or de-tyrosination (Wloga et al., 2017, Procter et al., et al., 2013). Thus, a subset of microtubules in CAD cells might be resistant to 492 nocodazole during HSV infection and still promote organization of peripheral assembly sites. (ii) 493 Biosynthetic and retrieval pathways for membrane glycoproteins might differ between these cell 494 types such that localization of assembly proteins to the same membrane compartment might 495 occur without a need for microtubule-dependent trafficking in CAD cells. It is interesting that 496 disruption of the cVAC by nocodazole in CAD cells creates a dispersed assembly apparatus 497 that is morphologically similar to that observed in epithelial cells, and that virus assembly in 498 epithelial cells is not sensitive to nocodazole treatment. Whether the similarities between the 499 assembly compartments in nocodazole-treated CAD cells and untreated epithelial cells are 500 merely superficial or reflective of similar mechanisms of assembly compartment formation is not 501 clear. 502 Similarities and discrepancies between HCMV cVAC and HSV cVAC. It is well-documented 503 that HCMV forms a unitary cVAC in infected cultured fibroblasts (Alwine, 2012) and forms a 504 dense cytoplasmic inclusion in cells from clinical samples (Gilloteaux and Nassiri, 2000). There 505 are many similarities between the cVAC formed by two herpesviruses regarding host membrane 506 arrangement, host cytoskeleton involvement, and viral factor requirement. First, we have 507 observed that Golgi-derived membranes concentrate to the HSV cVAC, similar to the Golgi 508 marker arrangement in HCMV-infected cells (Das et al., 2007, Das and Pellett, 2011), 509 suggesting herpesvirus conserved requirement for Golgi function. On the other hand, the 510 localization pattern of ER membranes in HSV-infected neuronal cells (Figure S1) is similar to 511 the common laboratory strains of HCMV-infected fibroblasts, in which ER membranes mostly 512 retain their natural structure (Zhang et al., 2019). This is different from the ER morphology of 513 wild-type HCMV strain TB40/E-infected cells, in which ER membranes are deformed by dilation 514 and ruffling (Zhang et al., 2019). This strain-specific difference is due to the quick loss of a 515 single gene UL148 (which encodes an ER-modification protein in HCMV strain TB40/E) during 516 the passage of the virus in cell cultures (Zhang et al., 2019). UL148 has no homolog in HSV, 517 thus the resemblance between ER patterns in HSV-infected cells and HCMV-infected cells is 518 not surprising. 519 Other host membrane markers, notably Rab family GTPases, localize to the cVAC of HSV and 520 HCMV in patterns that are consistent with their roles in the vesicle trafficking and in viral 521 assembly. For example, Rab11 participates in the viral assembly of both HSV and HCMV (Hook 522 et al., 2014, Krzyzaniak et al., 2009), and indeed, Rab11 concentrates to the cVAC of both 523 viruses (Das and Pellett, 2011, Das et al., 2007)(Figure 6, I and M). On the other hand, Rab5 is 524",

However, the much 537 shorter lifecycle, and the dynein dependence of early events in infection, make this approach 538 more difficult for HSV.

The properties of HSV-1(F) virus have 593 been described before (Ejercito et al., 1968). The HSV-1(F) BAC virus was a gift ). These two fragments were assembled together by PCR with a pair of outer primers: fwd 603 primer: 5'-CGGGGCTATATGTGGCTGGGGAGCGCGCCCCGAGGAACAAGCTGAGATG-3'; 604 rev primer: 5'-CTCCGCCTCCGAGGGCGGAACGGCCGCGCGGATCATCTC-3'. Recombinant 605 viruses were rescued by transfecting BAC DNA into Vero or Vero-derived complementing cells. 606 Virus containing mutations in the UL51 gene sequence were amplified on UL51-complementing 607 cells (Roller et al., 2014). HSV-1(F) BAC-derived virus containing deletions in the UL34 gene 608 sequence have been described before (Roller et al., 2010) and were amplified on UL34-609 complementing cells (Roller et al., 2000). The HSV-1(F) VP5-null virus and VP5-complementing 610 cells were kind gifts from Prashant Desai (Desai et al., 1993). HSV-1(F) UL35-RFP BAC virus 611 was a gift from Cornel Fraefel at the University of Z\u00fcrich (de Oliveira et al., 2008). HSV-2 strain 612 R519-derived BAC virus (bHSV2-BAC38) was a gift from Kening Wang at National Institute of 613 Allergy and Infectious Diseases (Wang et al., 2012). 614 Viral infections When infecting CAD and SH-SY5Y cells, HSV was diluted in the following 615 infection medium: DMEM containing 1% heat-inactivated serum and P/S. In synchronized 616 infection, cells were incubated in the infection medium containing HSV at 4\u00b0C for 1h before 617 replacing with warm infection medium to allow viral entry. This medium change is designated as 618 0 h.p.i. For drug treatment, the infection medium was replaced with the same medium 619 containing respective compound (or vehicle only). Stock solutions of nocodazole (AdipoGen), 620 ciliobrevin D (EMD Millipore), and cytochalasin B (AdipoGen) were made in DMSO. For SSG 621 and growth curve experiments, after 4\u00b0C incubation and medium replacement, monolayer of 622 confluent cells were incubated at 37\u00b0C for 1 h to allow viral entry. Then the monolayer was 623 incubated in a citrate buffer (50 mM sodium citrate, 4 mM KCl, adjusted to pH 3.0 with HCl) for 1 624 min to inactivate residual virus. The cell monolayer was then washed twice in PBS and 625 incubated in infection medium before drug treatment at 3 h.p.i. 626",
