The programs were successfully tested using data from advanced outbreak trajectories (Italy and Spain). The procedure was applied to data reported by Argentina. The projected total death toll will be 182 (277-182) with a peak of deaths (6(+/-2)) the 14 of April. The outbreak begins the 9 th of March and end completely the 20 th of May. However, already on 1 st of May, 2 s (95.45%) of the deaths have occurred. The death toll arises from a number of infected individuals between 36412 and 2275. Then, they were to use to process data from several Southern and Nicaragua. The trend is to show low number of total deaths compared with other disease outbreaks. A total projected number of deaths between 15148 and 9939 deaths for a total population of ca. 664 M inhabitants. The projected death toll is much lower (5-10 times) than those forecasted by the Imperial College Group (ICG) even considering the best scenario of total suppression of virus transmission. Using actual mortality rates it is possible to back calculate which number of infected individuals would produce such mortality. The calculated number of infected individuals (worst case scenario) is below 2.5 million. This is significantly lower than that calculated by ICG (> 45 millions). In most countries the outbreak will end in May or early June. The dynamics of the outbreaks seems to do not saturate the health services (hospital beds) but only Peru, Ecuador and Panama should have not enough ICU beds for grave COVID-19 patients.",

The socioeconomic consequences of such response are catastrophic, such as high unemployment, businesses bankruptcies, etc. Obviously is the response, based mainly on non-pharmacological interventions(NPI),[5] the cause of the economic crisis, not the disease itself. It is reasonable to ponder why such harsh measures has been taken in response to COVID-19 and not before upon seasonal influenza, HIV, H1N1 influenza,[6] etc. The usual answer is that COVID-19 is radically different and requires such measures. Besides, there is no vaccine for COVID-19 available. However, specifically in the case of influenza H1N1, the vaccine was produced only 5-6 months after the declaration of pandemic (June 2009) and 7 months after the outbreak (April 2009). [7] In the meantime, especially in the southern hemisphere, which was in autumnwinter where influenza strains are specially active, some kind of social distancing and some antivirals were the only way to fight the disease.",

There were targeted flight bans and in some countries school shutdown or phase out to springtime. Obviously, the social and economic consequences were small. It is interesting that the CDC guidelines, [13] suggest social distancing measures (school closing, banning public gatherings, isolation of infected, etc.) but no lockdown. The rationale behind social isolation is grounded on the studies of the effect of such interventions on the mortality of the 1918-1919 influenza pandemic. [14, 15] The community NPIs recommended by the CDC, [13] involve: School Closures and Dismissals and Social Distancing Measures for Schools, Workplaces, and Mass Gatherings. Those are made with together with personal NPI: voluntary home isolation (i.e., staying home when ill or self-isolation, respiratory etiquette and hand hygiene. As it can be seen, social distancing but short of lockdown or stay at home orders. The evidence supporting the applications of such NPIs is the studies of the effect of NPIs on the mortality outcomes of different US cities during the outbreak of pandemic influenza (1918) (1919) (1920) . [14, 15] Again, the NPIs were short of lockdown or stay at home order. Moreover, it is explicitly stated, [15] that an experimental study on the effect (and collateral effect) of NPI has not been performed because:\"the trend away from such traditional public health measures for disease control during the past 50 years,(stated in 2007) and ethical limitations of using population-wide nonpharmaceutical interventions in the absence of a serious threat\". [15] It seems that COVID-19 is such a big threat that even harsher NPIs are considered adequate today.",

The Gaussian equation (Farr's law) was symbolically integrated with Euler (http://euler.rene-grothmann.de/index.html) by adding integration constant. Method: fit with routines in Python (scipy.optimize, https://www.scipy.org/) in our own Python programs (available at https://github.com/cesarbarbero/programas-para-predecir-COVID-19/). The test suite was from Italy that contains more than 2/3 of the peak (deaths per day)-We also fit China that contains the whole forward peak. However, it does not contain the full data before the peak since the first reports are 17 deaths (in Wuhan). Moreover, recently (17/04/2020), they have incorporated 50% more deaths without information on the day of death. Therefore, the dataset of China is not usable. The program predicts the same parameters using total data from Italy (53 days) or 35 days (non zero deaths for most SHC), showing that it is able to adequately predict the evolution of deaths over time. Initially, the data from Argentina was obtained from the Ministry of Health of the Nation (MSN) by manual recording from daily reports (https://www.argentina.gob.ar/coronavirus/informe-diario). Then, the data from most southern hemisphere countries were obtained from worldometer (https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/#countries) by reading the graphs in the webpage (see acknowledgements for the help in data collection). However, the final runs were made with the data produced by John Hopkins University and stored in a github repository (https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/blob/master/csse_covid_19_data/csse_covid_19_time_series/time_series_covid19_deaths_global.csv #L17). In that way, the database is public and its quality is independently verified. A special program: \"Graphical fit\" was used to obtain roughly correct parameters (a,b,c,norm) to be used as seed and as central points for the constraint of the curve fitting routine. By trial and error, guided by the understading of each parameter on the shape of the curve, the simulated data is graphed along the experimental data. When a reasonable fit is obtained, the parameters are copied in the curve fitting program as seed. The constraints of the curve fit are set around those values. The curve fitting program is run until the parameters are different to the constraints. The numerical and graphical output is directly written in the manuscript, without any data manipulation. The results of the fit (numerical data and plots) for each country are provided in the supplementary information and in github.",

While in well-known diseases (e.g. measles) the cause of death is clearly assigned, with COVID-19 requires testing for the virus. In China the initial reports (22 nd of January) are of 17 cases. Applying the program to China show that there should be deaths due to COVID-19 before but there were not tests available. In other countries where the outbreak began later, the situation should be better. However, if the outbreak was not detected, deaths by COVID-19 could be assigned to other pathologies. Since the period between contagion an deaths is ca. 6 days [Updated understanding of the outbreak of 2019 novel coronavirus (2019nCoV) in Wuhan, China -Journal of Medical Virology, Jan. 29, 2020], it allow to find out the true beginning of the outbreak. In the case of Italy, the program calculates the 28 th (+/-3) of December 2019 as the date when 0% deaths has happened. Therefore, contagion in Italy should have been occurring in December 2019. To test the capacity of the program to predict the evolution, the test was performed using data well before the peak (only till 21 st of March). The forecast shows similar outcomes predicting a total number of deaths of 25456 (33092 -254569).

Several countries have already passed the peak (including Argentina) meaning that the outbreak is subsiding. Since the number of deaths have to be related with the number of new infections (with a delay), it also means that number of new cases is decreasing. In any epidemiological model, this means that the number of infections caused by an infected individual is decreasing in time. This could be to the fact that the number of susceptible contacts is decreasing (because all are already infected or recovered) or that the number of contacts is decreasing with time. A way to calculate the number of persons infected involves dividing by the rate of mortality (Rm = deaths/infected). However, Rm is not easily known because it would require to know exactly the number of persons infected in all the countries involved, and such number depends on the testing capabilities and testing protocol. In Argentina, only individuals who show symptoms are tested, therefore asymptomatic infected individuals are not counted. Since different Rm values have been reported, the Rm reported by South Korea (0.5 %) was used to produce the high limit number and that of Italy (8 %) to calculate the lower limit. The results are shown in the last two columns of Table 2 . The numbers for the whole SH are shown in the last but one row (right) of Table 2 . In the worst case scenario ca. 2M individuals will be infected, which is quite low since the population of the SH is of more than 664M. Obviously, if the rate of mortality of COVID-19 is as low of the seasonal influenza (0.1%), the number of cases will be higher (ca. 10 M) but such scenario means that the COVID-19 is not a grave menace for general population, as the seasonal influenza, and the generalized lockdown is unjustified.",

One of the more important concerns in this pandemic outbreak is the ability of different health systems to cope with the number of cases. Therefore, it is relevant to know the number of cases per day. In that way, it is possible to calculate the needs (hospital beds and intensive care unit (ICU) beds for each country (Table 3) . To do that, we assume that 20% of the cases require hospitalization and 5% of the cases require ICU beds. Using the population data and following the ICG report, [17] it is possible to calculate the number of hospital beds (and ICU beds) available. To do that we use the worst case scenario that all SH countries are Low Middle Income Countries (LMIC), which gives 1.5 beds/1000 inhabitants. Then, the some category of LMIC gives 1.75 ICU beds/100 beds. The Lower Income Countries (e.g. Bolivia) in the list",

Using open software libraries in Python (3.7) it is possible to produce programs which fit the experimental data (reported cumulative deaths). The programs are tested with advanced outbreaks (Italy and Spain) and give results comparable with those produced, using similar methods, by the IHME (Washington University, USA). The application to the reported data from Argentina allows forecasting a relatively small number of deaths (277-182). It also allows calculating: i) the day of the peak, the day of the begining and iii) the day of the end of the outbreak.",

Note that the reported data of deaths per day show a large scatter (worse than Italy) due to the difficult reporting of few deaths in a large country. The large scatter makes difficult to fit directly the Gaussian equation but 95% of the actual point occurs inside the uncertainty range (50%).Additionally, the equation allows calculating the end of the outbreak which is the 20 th (+/-3) of May.",
