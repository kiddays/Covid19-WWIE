History of hypertension was significantly 64 more frequently reported in the patients with putative IPA than patients without 65 aspergillosis (p=0.04). No other significant differences were observed in terms of age, 66 invasive aspergillosis EORTC-MSG risk factors, time between onset of symptoms and 67 intubation and times between onset of symptoms or intubation and Aspergillus respiratory 68 administration. No other immunosuppressant drug was administered in the ICU. 70 Specific anti-Aspergillus therapy was initiated in only one of the nine patients with putative 71 IPA. In this patient initially receiving caspofungin to treat concomitant invasive blood 72 Candida glabrata infection, antifungal treatment was switched to voriconazole. No 73 significant increase in fatality rate was observed in the patients with putative IPA (3/9 versus 74 3/18, p=0.4), although so far, 2/9 and 8/18 patients are still intubated in each group, 75 respectively. 76 Here we found putative IPA in almost one third of our successive critically ill COVID-19 77 patients, at a similar rate to what has been observed in influenza patients. 3,4 Interestingly, 78 when respiratory specimens were positive for Aspergillus, serum galactomannan was 79 negative.

Our findings strongly suggest that mechanically ventilated 81 COVID-19 patients should be systematically screened for Aspergillus infection markers. 82 Three of our cases had Aspergillus fumigatus culture with no positive qPCR detection or 83 galactomannan antigen in the BAL. Interestingly, not considering positive culture alone as a 84 diagnostic criterion, by contrast to what is currently accepted, 4,6 would have resulted in 85underestimating the frequency of putative IPA (22% rather than 33% in our study). 86Despite similar IPA rates in critically ill COVID-19 and influenza patients, the contribution of 87",
