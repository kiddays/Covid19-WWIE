The vast complexity in drug design and protocols regarding clinical trials often prohibit developing various new drug combinations for this epidemic disease in a limited time. Recently, remarkable improvements in computational power coupled with advancements in Machine Learning (ML) technology have been utilized to revolutionize the drug development process. Consequently, a detailed study using ML for the repurposing of therapeutic agents is urgently required. Here, we report the ML model based on the Na\u00efve Bayes algorithm, which has an accuracy of around 73% to predict the drugs that could be used for the treatment of COVID-19. Our study predicts around ten FDA approved commercial drugs that can be used for repurposing. Among all, we suggest that the antiretroviral drug Atazanavir (DrugBank ID -DB01072) would probably be one of the most effective drugs based on the selected criterions.",

Coronaviruses belong to a family of viruses mainly found in animals but with the recent outbreak, they have transmitted to humans. The new coronavirus, 2019-nCoV is termed as severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] which has now affected more than 200 countries with over 17,83,941 cases confirmed and 1,09,312 deaths reported all over the world [as on 12 April 2020] . This could potentially bring major challenges to global healthcare and disastrous effect on the global economy if the virus is not contained within a few months [10] . The common symptoms include cough, fever, shortness of breath, fatigue etc which makes it confusing for the patients to differentiate the symptoms with that of the typical cold and flu [10] [11] [12] [13] . Reports suggest that the virus is transmitted through body fluids of the infected patients, especially when in contact and while sneezing even though exact reasons are not known. Unfortunately, no drugs have been approved by regulatory agencies to treat SARS-CoV-2 infection until now. Efforts are ongoing on war footing to find the effective drug and vaccine to treat this pandemic.",

The betacoronavirus class includes severe acute respiratory syndrome virus (SARS-CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome virus (MERS-CoV), and the COVID-19 virus (SARS-CoV-2). Coronaviruses are found to be considerably large viruses with a singlestranded positive-sense RNA genome encapsulated inside a membrane envelope having proteins apprearing like spikes protruding from their surface. These spikes adheres onto human cells, through certain receptors on target cells, after which undergoes a structural change that lets the viral membrane fuse with the cell membrane. The viral genes then enter the host cell, producing more viruses. Recent studies show that, like the virus responsible for 2002 SARS outbreak, SARS-CoV-2 spikes also bind to receptors on the human cell surface called angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) [15] . Like SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 also attacks the lower respiratory system causing viral pneumonia. However, there are also reports that it could affect the gastrointestinal system, heart, kidney, liver, and central nervous system resulting in multiple organ failure [16] . Compiling the medical reports and data available from the patients, SARSCoV-2 is found to be more transmissible/contagious than SARS-CoV [17] .",

The advantage of AI approaches like ML is that they can be applied to learn from examples and build predictive models even when our understanding of the underlying biological processes is limited, or when computational simulations based on fundamental physical models are too expensive to be carried away. Another advantage of ML is to automatically learn to identify complex patterns that categorize sets from input data and thereby make intelligent decisions based on independent datasets [21] . ML can accurately predict drugtarget interactions as an enormous amount of complex information by studying hydrophobic interactions, ionic interactions, hydrogen bonding, van der Waals forces, etc. between molecules. Bioactivity datasets which are available from the numerous high throughput screens deliver useful means for machine learning classifiers as they contain binary information (active/inactive) as well as numerical values to classify different compounds under consideration [22, 23] .",

This classifier functions well and has advantages over many other induction algorithms. It has no entangled iterative parameter that makes it work for vast data sets.

Accuracy shows the model's performance relative to the real values and this can be calculated as (TN+TP/TN+TP+FP+FN). The Sensitivity shows the model's ability to identify the positive results and this is calculated as (TP/FN+TP) and the Specificity shows the model's ability to identify the negative results and this is calculated as (TN/TN+FP). A model with high specificity and sensitivity has a low error rate. The Balanced Classification Rate (BCR) is the mean of the sensitivity and specificity, which provides the accuracy of the model applied on the imbalanced dataset. This BCR can be calculated as 0.5*(specificity+sensitivity).",
