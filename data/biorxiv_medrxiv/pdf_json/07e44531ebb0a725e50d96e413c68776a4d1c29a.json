Accordingly, directing stem cell differentiation could provide a tractable approach to alter the abundance or quality of specialized cells of the small intestinal epithelium, including the secretory Paneth, goblet, and enteroendocrine populations. Yet, to date, there has been a lack of suitable tools and rigorous approaches to identify biological targets and pharmacological agents that can modify epithelial composition to enable causal testing of disease-associated changes with novel therapeutic candidates. To empower the search for epithelia-modifying agents, we establish a first-of-its-kind high-throughput phenotypic organoid screen. We demonstrate the ability to screen thousands of samples and uncover biological targets and associated small molecule inhibitors which translate to in vivo. This approach is enabled by employing a functional, cell-type specific, scalable assay on an organoid model designed to represent the physiological cues of in vivo Paneth cell differentiation from adult intestinal stem cells. Further, we miniaturize and adapt the organoid culture system to enable automated plating and screening, thereby providing the ability to test thousands of samples. Strikingly, in our screen we identify inhibitors of the nuclear exporter Xpo1 modulate stem cell fate commitment by inducing a panepithelial stress response combined with an interruption of mitogen signaling in cycling intestinal progenitors, thereby significantly increasing the abundance of Paneth cells independent of known WNT and Notch differentiation cues. We extend our observation in vivo, demonstrating that oral administration of Xpo1 inhibitor KPT-330 at doses 1,000fold lower than conventionally used in hematologic malignancies increases Paneth cell abundance. In total, we provide a framework to identify novel biological cues and therapeutic leads to rebalance intestinal stem cell differentiation and modulate epithelial tissue composition via high-throughput phenotypic screening in rationally-designed organoid model of differentiation.",

These vital functions are accomplished by specialized epithelial cells integrated with stromal and immune cell populations. Within the small intestine, adult intestinal stem cells (ISCs), conventionally identified by markers including Lgr5 (Barker et al., 2007) and Olfm4 (van der Flier et al., 2009) , provide a source of constant regeneration from which an ordered process of differentiation into secretory and absorptive epithelial cells determines composition, thereby steering barrier function. Under homeostatic conditions, WNT, BMP, and Notch signaling actively maintain the ISC niche (Kim et al., 2005; Pinto et al., 2003) . However, ISCs have a demonstrated capacity to integrate dietary and immune-derived signals to modulate their self-renewal and differentiation into specific secretory lineages (Beyaz et al., 2016; Biton et al., 2018; von Moltke et al., 2016) .",

In the barrier tissues of the upper respiratory tract and skin, changes in epithelial composition arising from aberrant stem cell differentiation (Naik et al., 2017; Ordovas-Montanes et al., 2018) may be a precipitating factor in infalmmatory diseases. Additionally, shifts in the composition and quality of mature epithelial cells descendant from ISCs are known to occur in the colon and the small intestine of patients suffering from inflammatory bowel disease (Graham and Xavier, 2020; Smillie et al., 2019) .

Existing chemical tools for small intestinal organoids may enable this approach. The addition of well-characterized small molecules to culture media provides for both enriching intestinal organoids for ISCs, and driving differentiation down specific lineages, by providing physiologically-meaningful cues, such as the modulation of WNT and Notch signaling (Yin et al., 2014) . Use of such rationally-directed differentiation has been applied to induce functional Paneth cells from enriched ISCs in vitro (Mead et al., 2018) . By employing small molecules to mimic known in vivo signaling cues of physiological differentiation from a stem cell, it becomes possible to construct organoids representative of lineage-specific stem cell differentiation and frame a screening campaign around identifying new biological targets which may modulate such differentiation. For instance, identification of biological targets and accompanying small molecules which enhance Paneth cell differentiation from ISCs. 5 Searching for novel targets which enhance Paneth cell differentiation and increase abundance in the native tissue may be therapeutically valuable. Declines in Paneth cell quality and number are observed in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) (Gassler, 2017; Khor et al., 2011; Liu et al., 2016; McGuckin et al., 2009; Xavier and Podolsky, 2007) .",

Additionally, treatment with R-spondin1, a potentiator of WNT signaling, can elevate the secretion of Paneth-specific alpha-defensins and resolve dysbiosis seen in mice with GvHD by stimulating ISCs to differentiate into Paneth cells (Hayase et al., 2017) .",

Other signaling pathways known to drive Paneth cell differentiation, including Notch signaling, face similar challenges. Activation of Notch signaling amplifies the proliferative progenitor population and promotes an absorptive cell lineage (Fre et al., 2005; Jensen et al., 2000; VanDussen et al., 2012) .

To model physiologically-driven Paneth cell differentiation, we employ a method of small molecule-mediated enrichment and differentiation of intestinal organoids from ISCs to Paneth cells. Murine intestinal organoids are typically expanded in a 3-D Matrigel scaffold with supplemented culture media containing growth factors intended to mimic the ISC niche -epidermal growth factor (E), BMP-antagonist noggin (N), and the aforementioned WNT-pathway enhancer R-spondin1 (R). Spontaneous differentiation of organoids grown in ENR media can be mitigated, and the population of ISCs enriched by the addition of small molecules CHIR99021 (C), an activator of WNT signaling, and valproic acid (V), an activator of Notch signaling. These ISC-enriched cultures can then be differentiated towards Paneth cells with the small molecules (C) and DAPT (D), an inhibitor of Notch signaling, as we have previously shown (Mead et al., 2018; Yin et al., 2014) . To measure changes in Paneth cell abundance or quality, we employ a previously demonstrated assay of Paneth cell-specific function and relative-abundance with a commercially-available assay for secreted lysozyme (LYZ) (Mead et al., 2018) . To scale this model system and measurement, we adapt conventional 3-D organoid culture into a 2.5-D pseudo-monolayer, where ISC-enriched organoids are partially embedded on the surface of a thick layer of Matrigel (at the Matrigel-media interface), rather than fully encapsulated in the Matrigel structure -an approach similar to others previously reported (Langhans, 2018) . This technique enables Matrigel plating, cell seeding, and media additions to be performed in a high-throughput, fully-automated, 384-well plate format and allows for LYZ secretion directly into cell culture media, thereby enhancing measurement sensitivity.",

To better inform how the 6 compounds increased total secreted LYZ, and to isolate only those which enhance Paneth differentiation robustly, we utilized flow cytometry to measure changes in Paneth cell representation within treated organoids during differentiation. Concurrently, to ensure that we do not select for compounds which manifest their behavior only in specific in vitro settings, we performed the analyses in the conventional 3-D culture method (4), thus providing control for 2.5-D culture system-specific effects. Single live cells were selected by several gating strategies and Paneth cells were identified as LYZ-high, CD24-mid, side scatter-high (SSC-high) (Supp. Fig. 1E ). Only one compound, KPT-330 -the most potent compound in validation screening -significantly enhanced the mature Paneth cell population within differentiating organoids, suggesting KPT-330 induces Paneth differentiation (1) (Fig. 1E) . Of the 5 remaining compounds, Nilotinib excluded, none changed organoid composition and are likely driving changes in Paneth quality (2) or are mediating effects dependent on 2.5-D culture (4). Nilotinib significantly decreased Paneth abundance, while significantly increasing total cell number, suggesting the overall increase in bulk LYZ secretion is an effect of increased proliferation (3), or 2.5-D-mediated effect (4).",

To distinguish the three stem-like clusters, and assess physiological relevance, we performed module scoring over gene sets identified to correspond to known ISC subsets in vivo (Biton et al., 2018 ) (Supp. Fig. 2D) . We see alignment with the type III and type I ISCs per the nomenclature of Biton et al., along with slight enrichment for a distinct type II (Supp. Fig. 2E ), though this population may also be an intermediate between stem I and III populations, sharing markers with both (Fig. 2D) . Accordingly, we adopted the naming scheme of Biton et al. to We next explored changes in cell type representation between organoids treated with KPT-330 versus control. Importantly, in the combined dataset, we do not observe cell clusters unique to KPT-330 treatment, but rather shifts in cluster composition (Supp. Fig.   2F ). Both conditions begin with over 75% of cells either stem II or stem III. By day 2, stem I emerges, accounting for approximately 25% of the cells in the control condition, but a smaller proportion in KPT-330-treated organoids. Early enterocytes emerge at day 1, with the continued differentiation to enterocytes, peaking at day 2 and becoming less prevalent by day 4. Early Paneth population appears to crest with enterocytes followed by a transition to Paneth cells continuing to day 6 ( Fig. 2E) . To better quantify the differences in representation between the KPT-330 and control conditions over time, we performed Fisher exact testing for each cell type relative to all others. This was done for each timepoint where that cell type accounted for at least 1% of cells in both KPT-330 and control samples. We present the relative enrichment or depletion of a cell population with KPT-330 treatment over time as the odds ratio (OR) with a corresponding 95% confidence interval. KPT-330 treatment leads to a depletion of stem I, II, III and enteroendocrine cells over time along with the corresponding enrichment of enterocytes and Paneth cells (Fig.   2G ). The observed two-fold enrichment in Paneth cells at day 6 mirrors our flow cytometry observations of a two-fold increase in mature Paneth cells, while also showing the unexpected early enrichment of enterocytes and longer-term depletion of a subset of stem cells -the quiescent stem I population.",

Of all the 2-day KPT-330 treatments, day 0-2 results in the greatest enrichment in mature Paneth cells, with longer exposure following day 2 providing additional, albeit lesser enrichment. Further, day 2-4 treatment produces moderate enrichment, while day 4-6 is no different than untreated (by flow cytometry) or slightly enriched (by LYZ secretion assay) (Fig. 3D & Supp. Fig. 3D ). Using an additional SINE, KPT-8602, we observe similar enrichment behavior as KPT-330 (Supp. Fig. 3E ). This data is consistent with Xpo1 inhibition altering stem II / III differentiation -the largest effects of Xpo1 inhibition are concurrent with periods in the differentiation course where stem II / III populations are most abundant. However, this data also suggests that Xpo1 inhibition may not be entirely stem-dependent, given the 14 lesser, but significant increases in Paneth cell number and function with later treatment, where stem II / III populations are greatly diminished.",

Significant gene sets with FDR < 0.05 reveal two major programs differentially We next examined whether the responses embodied by the significant differentiallyexpressed genes in stem II / III (day 0.25-2) may be pan-epithelial or restricted to the cycling stem II / III populations. The stress response module (differentially increased in stem II / III) is substantially increased across all cells during differentiation, with the greatest effect in the stem II / III as well as early mature cell populations, and lowest effect in the mature Paneth cells (Fig. 3G) . Conversely, the mitogen signaling module (differentially decreased in stem II / III) is selectively decreased in stem II / III and early enterocyte populations relative to all others. This selectivity corresponds with our observation that the majority of mitogen signaling occurs within the proliferative stem II / III populations relative to the mature populations. As further evidence of altered mitogen signaling impacting stem II / III cells following Xpo1 inhibition, we observe a decrease in We sought to clarify this conceptual model with the use of additional small molecule inhibitors known to modulate discrete components of our hypothesized differentiation process, namely: signaling through Xpo1-associated stress response including AP-1 and p53, signaling within the MAPK pathway, and finally Xpo1-mediated effects on mitosis through association with aurora kinases. We began by treating organoids along the ENR+CD differentiation course with SR11302, a small molecule inhibitor of AP-1, to test whether AP-1 is critical to the SINE-induced stress response -both alone and in combination with KPT-330. We observe that SR11302 significantly decreases functional LYZ secretion at the end of the 6-day differentiation, both in combination with and alone (Fig. 3I ). This suggests that AP-1 signaling is an important mediator of Paneth differentiation from ISCs. We next tested whether p53 is a downstream mediator of Xpo1 inhibition by repeating the above assay with two known p53 modulators: a p53 inhibitor pifithrin-a (PFTa), and p53 agonist serdemetan (serd.). Across a wide dose-range, both p53 modulators tested did not alter Paneth cell differentiation -neither alone nor in combination with KPT-330suggesting that the KPT-330 stress response is not dependent on p53 signaling modulated by either compound (Supp. Fig. 3G ). With the same assay, we began to probe the mitogen signaling response by adding the MEK inhibitor, cobimetinib (shown by Basak et al. to induce the quiescent ISC population), in combination with KPT-330.",

Because Paneth cell number and quality is known to physiologically change along the length of the small intestine, and diseases associated with Paneth cells most frequently present distally (Abraham and Cho, 2009), we sought to profile how Xpo1 inhibition may differentially affect proximal and distal small intestine. We tracked animal weight every other day and collected the proximal and distal thirds of the small intestine at day 14 for histological quantification of Paneth, stem, and goblet populations (Fig. 4A) . In this lower-dose regimen, we observe no significant changes in animal weight, suggesting that we are outside the gross toxicity range (Supp. Fig. 4B ). Paneth cells were counted within well preserved crypts -with at least 30 crypts quantified per animal (representative images Supp. Fig. 4C ) -and the counts were averaged. Compellingly, within this lower dose regimen, we observe significant increases in Paneth cell abundance both in the proximal and distal small intestine at doses of 0.01 mg/kg, and proximally at 0.2 mg/kg. We additionally quantified the abundance of Olfm4+ stem cells as well as PAS+ goblet cells within the same animals to ascertain whether the effect of SINE treatment was restricted to the Paneth cell compartment (representative images Supp. Fig. 4D,E) . Interestingly, we observe a significant increase in Olfm4+ stem cells within the distal SI at doses of 0.01mg/kg corresponding to the group with the greatest increase in Paneth cells (Fig.   4C ), suggesting a potential expansion of the stem cell niche commensurate with increased Paneth cell abundance. We did not identify any significant changes in the developmentally-related goblet cell population (Fig. 4D) . In total, this data suggests that SINE-treatment may be a meaningful approach to specifically increase Paneth cell abundance in vivo, and further validates our framework for using models of organoid differentiation in small molecule screening.",

Further, this approach to small molecule phenotypic screening enables a specific, functional readout in a dynamic and heterogeneous organoid model. Our approach provides perturbation capacity nearly two orders of magnitude greater than existing examples of non-genetic perturbations in organoid models, thereby enabling screens within the space of annotated small molecule libraries and empowering novel biological target discovery. By using a model that focuses on differentiation to a specific lineage (the Paneth cell), we are able to resolve a pathway and compounds which direct ISC fate decisions to drive subtle but significant effects on the in vivo tissue. We identify a series of compoundsknown to inhibit the nuclear exporter Xpo1 -acting on cycling ISCs by inducing a program of stress response and decreased mitogen signaling. This ISC response rebalances self-renewal and differentiation towards Paneth cell differentiation. Recent work on mitogen and stress response control of re-entry into cell cycle may provide important context on the necessity of overlap of these two responses (Yang et al., 2017) .",

To support that Xpo1 is the primary biological target of KPT-330, we used two additional Xpo1 inhibitors: KPT-8602 (a second-generation compound based on KPT-330), and leptomycin B (a canonical Xpo1 inhibitor which acts in a manner distinct from KPT-330 and KPT-8602) (Wang and Liu, 2019). Our flow cytometry results show both KPT-8602 and leptomycin B increasing the proportion of Paneth cells in the organoids (Fig. 1G). LYZ secretion assays with the additional Xpo1 inhibitors show similar Paneth cell-enrichments in both conventional (ENR) and Paneth-differentiating (ENR+CD) culture conditions (Supp.Fig. 1G, 1H). Western blotting for intercellular LYZ per unit weight also confirms enrichment with each of the known XPO1 inhibitors (Supp.Fig. 1I), consistent with the results of LYZ secretion assays and flow cytometry analyses.",

Further, ERK inhibition may affect differentiation by either suppression of enterocyte differentiation(De Jong et al., 2016) or by augmenting Wnt signaling(Heuberger et al., 2014) -both alternate explanations for the observed synergy. Additionally, we see that the pan-epithelial stress response induced by Xpo1 inhibition in vitro involves the AP-1 pathway -which also appears to play an important role in Paneth differentiation -and may be mediated via transcriptional changes in Atf3. In vivo, Atf3 is implicated in the regulation of stress responses in disease of the barrier tissue",

            "text": "While we have demonstrated that Xpo1 inhibition in vivo significantly increases the abundance of Paneth cells within the small intestinal crypts, we believe there are two key mediators of biological potency which may explain heterogeneity of response along the small intestine, and may be investigated to enhance effect in future studies. The first is a consideration of the pharmacological profile and tissue distribution of the agent we used -KPT-330, and the second are elements of tissue and stem cell niche biology which our organoid model does not presently incorporate. Future studies may improve the potency of Xpo1 inhibition within the small intestinal crypts by re-formulating or targeting the delivery of SINE compounds to the crypt microanatomy and favor distal over proximal small intestine, where disease biology is most relevant and we observe the most robust expansion of Paneth cells. Additionally, as our knowledge of the in vivo stem cell niche improves, organoid models can be refined in an iterative fashion, further enhancing model fidelity and increasing the probability of compound translation from in vitro to in vivo.This approach -employing a physiologically-motivated set of cues to modulate intestinal stem cell differentiation and layering on a screen for new regulators of that differentiation at scale -may be further applied both within the small intestine and more broadly across adult barrier tissues to modulate the composition of epithelial specialists through novel molecular targets and associated small molecules. For example, this same framework may be applied in the context of enteroendocrine cell development within the small intestine to explore ways in which important hormone secretion -including gpl-1 -may be modulated. While establishing the appropriate model and a screening assay for a study of enteroendocrine differentiation is not trivial, it should be possible based on the approach we have demonstrated here. Overall, we provide a framework to construct 21 organoid models of lineage-specific differentiation that can uncover pathways regulating differentiation and reveal compounds controlling barrier tissue composition.AcknowledgementsThis work was supported in part by the Koch Institute Support(core) Grant P30-CA14051 from the National Cancer Institute.
