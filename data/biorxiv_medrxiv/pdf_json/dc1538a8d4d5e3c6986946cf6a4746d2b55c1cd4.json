Ground-glass opacity (53/56, 94.6%) was the most common morphological depiction in CT scan on admission. However, only 19.6% of patients showed multiple lesions, 42.9 % patients presented bilateral lesions. Compared with mild patients, most severe patients took CT scan in this study within seven days. The lesions that were present in asymptomatic individuals progressed to bilateral diffuse disease with consolidation around day 10 after the symptom onset. [20] [21] [22] The predominant CT pattern was unilateral and multifocal ground-glass opacities in early stage, then lesions quickly evolved to bilateral, diffuse ground-glass opacity in later stage. 20 However, those characteristics were not consistent with what we had expected in this study. Therefore, the value of lung CT in determining the prognosis of mild COVID-19 patients still needs further research.",

Overall, Fangcang shelter hospitals have substantially reduced the time from the onset of severe symptoms to admission to a designated hospital. Early application of the Fangcang shelter hospital may contribute to alleviate the shortage of medical resources and decrease the ratio of severe patients.

The hospital adopted district management and provided medical service 24 hours on call. The digital ratio of patients to doctors and nurses is about 1.6 to 1. Accurate assessment before admission and effective bed distance in the mobile cabin to some extent prevented the interactions between the patients.4 Tens of thousands of new patients have been diagnosed in the world recently every day, which requires enormous medical resources. However, the lack of medical resources in short time is an important cause for the rapid spread and the increased mortality of COVID-19. The Fangcang shelter hospitals could supply the basic treatment for those expanding cases and triage to prevent more family or community transmission cases, in a manner of saving medical resources to the greatest extent.",
