In addition, many of these predictions are derived before the peak of the outbreak has been observed yet (as is still currently the case for many countries). In this work, we show that peak phase and data paucity have a substantial impact on the reliability of model predictions. Although we focus on a recent model of the COVID pandemics, our conclusions most likely apply to most existing models, which are variants of the socalled \"Susceptible-Infected-Removed\" or SIR framework. Our results highlight the need for performing systematic reliability evaluations for all models that currently inform public health policies. They also motivate a plea for gathering and opening richer and more reliable data time series (e.g., ICU occupancy, negative test rates, social distancing commitment reports, etc).",

The entire scientific community is now addressing the many issues that the virus poses, with an unprecedented collaborative spirit. One of these issues is of primary importance for guiding national and international decision makers: namely, predicting the health requirements and outcomes of the current epidemiologic event (Siedner et al., 2020; Wang, 2020) . Over the past two months, about a thousand modelling papers have been deposited on preprint servers such as ArXiv or MedRXiv (Nature, 2020) . This, if anything, demonstrates how fast and efficiently the scientific community can be set in motion towards a common goal. However, it is now apparent that models have not reached consensus, e.g., when it comes to predicting the population levels acquired immunity within the next months . This is unfortunate, since thisand related predictions-are critical for designing suppression or mitigation strategies that aim at limiting the human cost of the current pandemic (Canabarro et al., 2020; James et al., 2020; Rodriguez et al., 2020) .",

            "text": "Most models that attempt to furnish such predictions are variants of the SIR framework (Kermack et al., 1927) . In brief, these models assume that the population is divided into, e.g., 'Susceptible', 'Infected', and 'Removed 1 ' compartments, through which individuals transit at a pace that is characteristic of the time course of the infection and associated socio-medical measures. Under mild assumptions, all SIR models predict that the population dynamics will eventually reach so-called 'disease-free equilibria', which signal the end of the epidemic outbreak by exhaustion of the 'susceptible' compartment. This means that the signature of an epidemic lies in the transient dynamics of observable health reports such as confirmed case numbers and mortalities. These models have proven very useful in predicting, e.g., the prevalence or the duration of an epidemic. When properly adjusted to observable epidemiologic data, they also can serve to predict the impact of candidate health policies such as vaccination or social distancing (Ganem et al., 2020; Jeria et al., 2020; Kissler et al., 2020; Moghadas et al., 2020) . Given the past success of these models, it may then come as a surprise that, despite relying on the same data sources, these models do not make the same predictions. In this note, we argue that this lack of consensus arises because modellers use the same dataset 2 , which comprises cumulative counts of death and positive COVID testing. The critical question here is: can these data sufficiently constrain estimates of SIR cycles? If not, then subtle variants of SIR models may make dramatically different predictions, despite showing almost no difference in terms of the fit accuracy on the available data so far (Salomon, 2020) . Also, model predictions may depend sensitively upon the current phase of the epidemic event: more precisely, whether the outbreak peak has been reached or not (Lin et al., 2020) . This is because the ramping phase of the epidemic transient may not evince all the processes that are relevant for estimating unknown model parameters (and hence making reliable model-based predictions).",

            "text": "The infection status is the closest to native SIR models, and includes susceptible, infected, contagious or immune states. Note that, at this point, the model assumes that the immune state is absorbing, i.e. people cannot get the disease twice. The clinical status factor comprises asymptomatic, symptomatic, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) or deceased. Finally, the diagnostic status captures the fact that a given individual can be untested, waiting for the results of a test, or declared either positive or negative. Model transitions amongst states are controlled by rate constants (inverse time constants) and probability constants (e.g., the probability of dying when in ICU). The ensuing set of state probabilities can then be related to some specific observable epidemiologic outcomes, such as the number of deceased people per day or the number of people newly infected who have been tested positive. Figure 1 below summarizes the causal structure implicit in conditional transition probabilities. We refer the reader to Friston et al. (Friston et al., 2020) for a complete mathematical description of the model. In brief, this compartmental model generates timeseries data based on a mean field approximation to ensemble or population dynamics. The implicit probability distributions are over four latent factors, each with four levels or states (see main text). In particular, this model assumes that (i) there is a progression from a state of susceptibility to immunity, through a period of (pre-contagious) infection to an infectious (contagious) status, (ii) there is a progression from asymptomatic to ARDS, where people with ARDS can either recover to an asymptomatic state or not. With this setup, one can be in one of four places, with any infectious status, expressing symptoms or not and having test results or not. Note that-in this construction-it is possible to be infected and yet be asymptomatic. Crucially, the transitions within any factor depend upon the marginal distribution of other factors. For example, the probability of becoming infected, given that one is susceptible to infection, depends upon whether one is at home or at work. Similarly, the probability of developing symptoms depends upon whether one is infected or not. The probability of being testing negative depends upon whether one is susceptible (or immune) to infection, and so on. Finally, to complete the circular dependency, the probability of leaving home to go to work depends upon the number of infected people in the population, mediated by social distancing. At any point in time, the probability of being in any combination of the four states determines what would be observed at the population level. For example, the occupancy of the deceased level of the clinical factor determines the current number of people who have recorded deaths. Similarly, the occupancy of the positive level of the testing factor determines the expected number of positive cases reported. From these expectations, the expected number of new cases per day can be generated. A more detailed description of the generative model can be found in Friston et al . Parameter estimation and model comparison relies on a variational Bayesian approximation scheme (Daunizeau, 2018; Friston et al., 2007) which is adopted in established computational neuroscience toolboxes (Ashburner, 2012) . In this particular work, we have chosen to implement the DCM-covid model from scratch, and make it available for another open academic model-based data analysis toolbox (Daunizeau et al., 2014) . We did this to provide software validation for subsequent data analyses performed with the DCM-covid model.",

In contrast, when the peak is yet to manifest (late peaks), only the accuracy on time-to-peak estimation is significantly worse for VB1 than for VB0 (p<10 -4 ). Interestingly, the ICU occupancy error is highest for VB1 when the peak has already been observed (cf. lower right panel).

It turns out that model-based estimates of the effective reproduction rates' dynamics are clearly higher when accounting for ICU occupancy and negative test rates (cf. upper-right panel on Figure 7 ).

Testing procedures also have imperfect sensitivity and specificity (Patel et al., 2020) , and ICU occupancy actually depend upon heterogeneous clinical criteria (e.g., respiratory support versus reanimation).

            "text": "Performing this type of analysis for currently available models is beyond the scope of the current work. However, our results highlight the need for evaluating the reliability of model predictions that are currently used by national and international socio-political decision makers. They also motivate the gathering of multiple data time series and making them available to the modelling community. This requirement obviously extends beyond ICU occupancy and negative test rates Salomon, 2020) . In the near future for instance, data about the number of asymptomatic cases in the population, about how infectious are children or about individual immunity after recovery may prove critical. In order to validate model predictions, particularly those related to infected or clinical status, biological assays of these inferred measures are required. Serological surveys for example are being rolled out to examine community infection rates. In a recent study in the Santa Clara region of California antibodies to SARs-CoV-2 were identified in 1.5% of 3,330 people sampledwith an adjusted population prevalence of 2.4% to 4.26% of the population (Bendavid et al., 2020) , with similar rates identified in an analysis of Dutch blood samples in line with model estimates . Larger 'serosurveys' will ultimately be required to more precisely define these measures with large populations being enrolled currently in Germany and by the US National Institute of Health. In addition, reports from centres of recent outbreaks are providing further details that can inform model parameter priors. For example two hospitals in New York City have recently reported a mechanical ventilation requirement for 33.1% of patients admitted for the treatment of Covid-19 (Goyal et al., 2020) . The impact of these and other kinds of data on the reliability of model-based predictions could be evaluated with the approach presented here, irrespective of the model used.",

The particular form Equation 1 takes for confirmed cases and death counts, derives from the fact that model inversion focuses on fitting newly (daily) counts, as opposed to cumulative counts (with the exception of remission rates and ICU occupancy).One can see from Equation 1 that observable outcomes provide only partial information regarding internal (latent or hidden) model states. At this point, we note that, in principle, nothing prevents such SIR models to be fitted to other types of observable data. However, at the time of writing this manuscript, no other data type was reliably and regularly accessible. We therefore focus on these five observable outcomes.c. Numerical assessment of prediction accuracyAt the time of writing, most western European countries (including, e.g., UK, Germany, France, Italy, Spain, Ireland and Switzerland) have either passed the peak of the pandemic event or are about to pass it. Available data typically start on January the 20 th , yielding approximately a hundred daily data points up until the current time. But the transient dynamics of the COVID pandemic will not approach disease-free equilibria states for a further 6 to 8 months.
