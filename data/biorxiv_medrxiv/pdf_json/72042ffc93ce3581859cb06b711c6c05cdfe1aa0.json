To date, thousands of cases of COVID-19 have been reported in England, and over 18,000 patients have died. While there has been progress in managing this disease, it is not clear which factors, in addition to age, affect the severity and mortality of COVID-19. A recent analysis of COVID-19 in Italy identified links between air pollution and death rates. Here, we explored potential links between three major air pollutants related to fossil fuels and SARS-CoV-2 mortality in England. We compared current, SARS-CoV-2 cases and deaths recorded in public databases to region-level air pollution data monitored at over 120 sites across England. We found that the levels of some markers of poor air quality, nitrogen oxides and ozone, were associated with COVID-19 mortality in different English regions, after adjusting for population density. We conclude that the levels of some air pollutants are linked to COVID-19 cases and morbidity. We consider that our study provides a useful framework to guide health policies in countries affected by this pandemic.",

In fact, prolonged exposure to common road transport pollutants, including nitrogen oxides and ground-level ozone, a by-product of chemical reactions between nitrogen oxides and volatile organic compounds, can significantly exacerbate cardiovascular morbidity, airway oxidative stress and asthma 8 . Such pollutants can also cause a persistent inflammatory response and increase the risk of infection by viruses that target the respiratory tract 9,10 . We therefore addressed whether infectivity and mortality rates of COVID-19 in England are linked to air pollution. This hypothesis is supported by observations that the geographical patterns of COVID-19 transmission and mortality among countries, and even among regions of the same country, closely align with local levels of air pollutants 10 . For example, increased contagiousness and COVID-19-related mortality in northern Italian regions, including Lombardia, Veneto and Emilia Romagna, have been correlated with high levels of air pollutants in these regions 10 .",

Our study used publicly available data (Table 1) The spatial pattern of COVID-19 deaths appeared to mimic the geographical distribution of COVID-19-related cases, with the largest numbers of COVID-19 deaths occurring in London and in the Midlands ( Figure 2 ). Previous studies suggest that those two areas present the highest annual average concentration (\u03bcg/m 3 ) of nitrogen oxides 11 . In addition, ground-level ozone concentrations have been previously shown to vary significantly with latitude and altitude, depending on concentration of ozone in the free troposphere, long-range transport and its precursor emissions 12 . Therefore, we sought to determine if spatial variations in nitrogen dioxide, nitrogen oxide as well as ground-level ozone concentrations in England are associated with increased COVID-19 infection and mortality. To this end, we constructed three generalised linear models to estimate the association between each air pollutant with the cumulative number of both COVID-19 cases and deaths in England.",

We, therefore, used the negative binomial model for further analysis. This model showed that population density is a significant predictor of COVID-19 cases (p-value < 0.01) as well as levels of nitrogen oxide dioxide (p-value < 0.01). This shows that levels of nitrogen oxides increase the accuracy of the model, indicating that they act as significant predictors of COVID-19 cases. We next applied a similar workflow for the number of COVID-19 deaths ( Table 3 ). The negative binomial regression remains the optimal model, and shows that ozone, nitrogen oxide and nitrogen dioxide are significantly associated with COVID-19 deaths, together with population density.",
