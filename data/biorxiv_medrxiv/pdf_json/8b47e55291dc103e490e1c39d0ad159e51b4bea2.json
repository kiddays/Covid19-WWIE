            "text": "As of April 23, 2020, more than 190,000 deaths have been attributed to Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). 1 Millions of infections by SARS-CoV-2, the virus responsible for COVID-19, have been reported, though its full extent has yet to be determined due to limited testing. 2 Government interventions to slow viral spread have disrupted daily life and economic activity for billions of people. Strategies to ease restraints on human mobility and interaction, without provoking major resurgence of transmission and mortality, will depend on accurate estimates of population levels of infection and immunity. 3 Current testing for the virus largely depends on labor-intensive molecular techniques. 4 Individuals with positive molecular tests represent only a small fraction of all infections, given limited deployment and the brief time window when PCR testing is sensitive. [5] [6] [7] The proportion of undetected cases in the original epidemic focus was estimated to be as high as 86%, 8 and asymptomatic infections are suspected to play a substantial role in transmission. [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] Widely available, reliable antibody detection assays would enable more accurate estimates of SARS-CoV-2 prevalence and incidence. On February 4, 2020, the Secretary of the United States Department of Health and Human Services issued emergency use authorization (EUA) for diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2, 15 allowing nucleic acid detection and immunoassay tests to be offered based on manufacturer-reported data without formal FDA clearance. 16 In response, dozens of companies have begun to market laboratory-based immunoassays and point-of-care tests. Rigorous, comparative performance data are crucial to inform clinical care and public health response.",

For these tests, two further drops of diluent were added to successfully recover control indicators in all affected tests. These results were included in analyses. During testing, two plates were transposed 180\u02da and assays were run in the opposite order from the wells documented on cartridges. These data were corrected and accuracy was confirmed by empty well position and verification of a subset of results. Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assays (ELISAs): Epitope Diagnostics ELISAs were performed according to manufacturer specifications. Cutoffs for IgG and IgM detection were calculated as the package insert described (see Supplementary Methods). Values greater than the cutoff were considered positive. An in-house ELISA was performed with minor deviations from a published protocol. 18 SARS-CoV-2 Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) protein was produced from the published construct (NR-52306, BEI Resources).

This case could represent COVID-19 not detected by RT-PCR, reinforcing the importance of caution in interpreting negative molecular results as ruling out the infection. Moreover, this suggests potential utility of serological testing as a supplemental diagnostic tool, given the decline in sensitivity of current molecular tests in the second week of illness.5 Appropriate clinical algorithms for serology testing, including confirmatory or reflexive testing, have yet to be determined. These algorithms will be affected by test performance characteristics and prevalence of disease across all presentations of infected individuals. Importantly, we still do not know the extent to which positive results by serology reflect a protective immune response. 24 Future functional studies are critical to determine whether specific antibody responses predict virus neutralization and protection against re-infection. Until this is established, conventional antibody assays should not be used as predictors of future infection risk.",
