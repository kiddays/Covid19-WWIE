Since there are various types of NPIs, and many other factors that may impact each of them, it is very challenging to measure the impacts of NPIs on the controlling of COVID-19 growths directly. We assume that the time-series cumulative number of cases should reflect the effectiveness of the NPIs. Therefore, we propose to develop an informatics strategy to conduct secondary time-series data analysis to learn COVID-19 growing patterns to characterize the efficacy of the NPIs.
