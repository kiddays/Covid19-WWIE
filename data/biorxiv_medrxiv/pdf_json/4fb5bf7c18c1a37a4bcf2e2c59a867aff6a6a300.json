            "text": "The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) originated in Wuhan, China, in December 2019 and has rapidly spread around the world [1] . There is limited understanding of the epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2, the pathogen that causes the disease COVID-19. Currently, the epicentre of the virus is in Europe and New York in the United States of America [2] . In Africa, the virus is just starting to set its foothold, with South Africa now reporting the majority of cases. The first case of the COVID-19 in South Africa was reported on the 5 th of March 2020 [3] . Measures to contain the epidemic culminated in the declaration of the state of disaster leading to a national lockdown on the 26 th of March 2020 with Gauteng, Western Cape, KwaZulu-Natal and the Free State provinces reporting most of the COVID-19 cases. The map in Figure 1 shows the distribution of COVID-19 confirmed cases in South Africa before the government mandated a lockdown. Gauteng province appeared to be the \"epicentre\" of COVID-19 in South Africa for a number of reasons. First, the province has the largest population density [4, 5] and the urban population is poor with 20% of its population being food insecure [4] . Second, Gauteng province has two international airports including OR Tambo International Airport handling over 21 million passengers annually [6] . Third, the volume of people that use public transport runs into millions daily creating a fertile ground accelerating the spread of the disease. Finally, the province is the country's economic hub, and many people (including international visitors) travel in and out of the province daily [4] . With the majority of confirmed cases early in the outbreak having been linked to international travel [7] , it is not surprising that the most affected provinces (Gauteng, Western Cape and KwaZulu-Natal) have international airports with direct flights to affected global regions ( Figure 1 ). The cases in the Free State province have mainly been attributed to a cluster transmission resulting from a mega church gathering [8] .",

Moreover, underlining disease conditions such as diabetes, hypertension and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease are prevalent in South African and these are known to present enormous challenges in the management of COVID-19 cases [15] .

However, it is important to note that expectations that the development of a highly effective vaccine for the novel-coronavirus will be achieved in the coming months are extremely optimistic, especially when considering that a vaccine has still not been successfully created for viruses like HIV, which has been in development for many years [44, 51] . Nevertheless, the huge global interest in quickly identifying an effective vaccine could increase the possibility that a successful vaccine candidate can be developed in the coming months [43] . Even when a safe and effective vaccine becomes available, there are several logistical and operational challenges that need to be addressed for successful deployment and for the vaccine to achieve the desired coverage [52, 53] .",

However, the reduction in the number of daily reported cases should be interpreted with caution as this could also have been a result of many other factors such as reduced international travel to high-risk regions and behaviour change. As the epidemic continues to unfold, it remains to be seen what trend the epidemic will follow if local transmissions are sustained within South Africa. The implementation of this society shut down is not sustainable in the long term, nor is likely to be tolerated for too long by the population. A vaccine would be an ideal preventative strategy for COVID-19 but it appears that it should be complemented with prevention approaches such as isolation, quarantine, personal hygiene and limitations of public gatherings in order to achieve optimal protection of the population in South Africa.",

The estimate of \u211b0 is based on available data and this estimate could possibly change depending on the quality of the data from the start of the epidemic (with possible under-reporting of cases in the initial phases of the epidemic). We note that spatial modelling mainly in the affected provinces would have been ideal but we did not have good data on a finer resolution to effectively parameterise a spatial model but as the epidemic evolves, nascent data on local COVID-19 transmission in South Africa is becoming available. We used a simple mathematical model without other population demographics as these were not important for short-term prediction [55] and such models are also important when epidemiological and clinical disease characteristics of the disease are not well established as is the case for COVID-19 [56] . The simple model is only intended to give preliminary estimates for an epidemic that is evolving and whose trend has the potential to change dramatically overtime. However, it would be interesting to see how our results will change when a more complicated model is used. Despite these shortfalls, findings in this study are im- COVID-19 pandemic has continued to spread and causing many deaths than any infectious disease we have seen in recent years and this calls for an urgent and well-coordinated timely and effective public health response. Currently there is no proven treatment or vaccines for COVID-19 and countries have embraced quarantine, social distancing, and isolation of infected individuals as to contain the pandemic. Thus, the building of suitable mathematical models to weight out the impact of current public health control measures and explore the potential utility of anticipated biomedical interventions such as vaccines is paramount.",
