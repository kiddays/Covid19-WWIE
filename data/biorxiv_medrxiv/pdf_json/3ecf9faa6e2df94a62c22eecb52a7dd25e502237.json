While reversing this quiescence is an effective approach to reactivate latent HIV from T cells in culture, it can cause deleterious cytokine dysregulation in patients. Here we report that FOXO1, a key regulator of T-cell quiescence, promotes latency and suppresses productive HIV infection. In resting T cells, FOXO1 inhibition induces ER stress and activates two associated transcription factors: activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4) and nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT). Both factors associate with HIV chromatin and are necessary for HIV reactivation. Indeed, inhibition of PKR-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase (PERK), a known link between ER stress and ATF4, and calcineurin, a calcium-dependent regulator of NFAT, synergistically suppress HIV reactivation induced by FOXO1 inhibition. Thus, our studies uncover a novel link between FOXO1, ER stress, and HIV infection that could be therapeutically exploited to selectively reverse T-cell quiescence and reduce the size of the latent viral reservoir.",

These cells are rare, long-lived, and generally quiescent. Although anti-retroviral therapy (ART) effectively suppresses HIV replication, therapy interruption results in reactivation of the latent reservoir, necessitating life-long treatment, and there is no cure 1,2 . One strategy to eliminate latently infected cells is to activate virus production using latency reversing agents (LRAs) with the objective of triggering cell death through virus-induced cytolysis or immune clearance. Efficient viral reactivation requires a calibrated degree of activation that avoids inducing polyclonal T cell activation or a cytokine storm that would negate the potential benefit. Known LRAs target various pathways to induce viral reactivation, and include PKC agonists (e.g. Prostratin), epigenetic modulators (e.g. HDAC or bromodomain inhibitors), and modulators of the PI3K or mTOR signaling pathways 3-6 . However, to date, clinical trials of existing LRAs have not demonstrated successful reduction of the latent reservoir 7 . Thus, a better understanding of how HIV latency is established and maintained is needed to improve the design of interventions.",

Furthermore, FOXO proteins negatively regulate HIV transcription through Tat-mediated repression 17 , and FOXO1 inhibition accelerates productive infection 18 . Because FOXO activity, especially FOXO1, promotes and maintains the quiescent state of memory CD4 + T cells, in which HIV establishes latency, we hypothesized that FOXO1, directly or indirectly, induces HIV latency. Here we identify a pathway that links HIV latency with FOXO1 activity via ER stress signaling, but without general T cell activation. Having shown that FOXO1 inhibition prevents latency establishment and also successfully purges the virus from its latent reservoirs, we propose that combining early ART with a FOXO1 inhibitor may downsize the latent reservoir.",

In this system, latently infected K562 cells express the mKO2 fluorescent protein under the control of the EF1\u03b1 promoter, while cells containing a productive and active virus express both mKO2 and GFP fluorophores, the latter controlled by the HIV-1 LTR. Upon treatment with increasing concentrations of AS1842856, the proportion of latently infected cells decreased, despite no significant changes in the total infection rate or viability ( Figure 1a) . Concomitantly, the proportion of actively infected cells increased, as expected. The IC50 of the inhibitor observed in our cell culture system was 74 \u00b1 15 nM, near its in vitro IC50 of 33 nM 20 .

Because FOXO proteins control the cell cycle and promote a quiescent state, each knockdown led to an increase in the proliferation rate (Extended Data Figure 1g ), in agreement with previous findings on human bladder cancer cells 21 and MCF-7 breast adenocarcinoma cells 22 . However, only FOXO1 downregulation increased productive infection and decreased latent infection (Figure 1d ). Furthermore, FOXO1 knockdown rendered infected cells more sensitive to AS1842856 treatment, shifting the IC50 (Figure 1e and Extended Data Figure 1d -f).

After 6 days in culture, cells reactivated luciferase expression in response to increasing concentrations of FOXO1 inhibitor (Figure 3b ) as well as in response to generalized T cell activation induced with either with a combination of phytohemagglutinin and interleukin-2 (PHA/IL-2) or with antibodies directed against the CD3 and CD28 receptors (Extended Data Figure 3b) . Notably, FOXO1 inhibition did not induce generalized T cell activation, as measured by expression of CD69 and CD25 activation markers on the cell surface (Extended Data Figure 3a ). Combining AS1842856 (100 nM) with a low dose of prostratin (250 nM), a natural protein kinase C activator that induces partial T-cell activation 24, 27 , significantly increased the AS1842856 effect in primary T cells, mirroring the synergistic effect of TNFa in J-Lat cells. No change in primary T-cell viability was observed in response to FOXO1 inhibition (Figures 3a-c) .",

Although FOXO1 has been connected with the prevention of glycolysis 28 , treatment with AS1842856 did not affect expression of glycolytic enzymes or FOXO1 itself. Upstream regulator analysis identified TRIB3 and ATF4 as the top regulators of AS1842856-induced gene changes ( Figure 4d ). Specifically, the algorithm predicted that TRIB3 was highly inhibited, while ATF4 was activated ( Figure 4d ). TRIB3 is known to inhibit ATF4 29,30 , a transcription factor specifically upregulated at the protein level as part of the integrated stress response, which involves phosphorylation of the translation initiation factor eIF2a by various stressspecific kinases 31-33 . RNA-Seq analysis of AS1842856-treated CD4 + T cells at 12 hours after treatment showed upregulation of pathways including ribosomal large subunit assembly, rRNA processing, and the unfolded protein response (UPR), supporting a role for ATF4 and the integrated stress response in gene changes after FOXO1 inhibition (Extended Data Figure 4a -c). In line with this hypothesis, FOXO1 inhibition increased expression of ATF4 protein levels in CD4 + T cells across multiple donors (Figure 4e ).",

While low levels of ATF4 bound HIV LTR chromatin in untreated J-Lat cells, its recruitment was 3-fold enriched after AS1842856 treatment ( Figure 5a ). We also observed a marked increase in RNA polymerase II recruitment to the HIV promoter after FOXO1 inhibition, consistent with HIV transcription reactivation. The RelA subunit of the NF-kB transcription factor, a key regulator of HIV transcription in response to T cell activation or TNFa exposure 36 , was not recruited to the HIV LTR after AS1842856 treatment but was significantly enriched after TNFa treatment, as expected ( Figure 5a ). Nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) can occupy the NF-kB binding sites in the HIV LTR 37 , and is activated through calcium mobilization after T-cell activation, rather than by protein kinase C activation, as is the case for NF-kB 38, 39 . NFAT was markedly enriched at the HIV LTR after FOXO1 inhibition (Figure 5a ), indicating that FOXO1 in resting T cells suppresses a (non-canonical) transcriptional program that controls HIV transcription without NF-kB, but with ATF4 and NFAT. This result explains the synergy observed between AS1842856 and TNFa or prostratin, as these compounds activate HIV through NF-kB 27 .",

Increasing concentrations of CsA suppressed HIV reactivation induced by AS1842856, but not TNF\u03b1, supporting a specific role of NFAT in FOXO1 inhibitor-mediated latency reversal (Figure 5c ). Treatment with the PERK inhibitor or CsA alone suppressed HIV reactivation by ~ 42.5 % (49 \u00b1 22 % (PERKi); 36 \u00b1 7 % (CsA)), whereas the combination almost completely blocked AS1842856-mediated viral reactivation (83 \u00b1 4 %) (Figure 5d ). This result suggests that both ATF4 and NFAT are important for HIV reactivation in response to FOXO1 inhibition.",

            "text": "Both transcription factors are linked to ER stress, either through activation of PERK or mobilization of ERresident calcium stores 47, 48 . To test the concept that ER stress reactivates HIV from latency, we treated J-Lat cells with known inducers of ER stress 49 , including thapsigargin, a sarco/ER Ca 2+ ATPase [SERCA] inhibitor, Brefeldin A, a retrograde vesicular transport inhibitor, and fenretinide, a clinically tested synthetic retinoid derivative. All resulted in HIV-1 reactivation, and fenretinide treatment acted most strongly ( Figure  5e ). Activation by these agents was associated with dose-dependent cellular toxicity, explained by their known function as potent apoptosis inducers 50 (Extended Data Figure 5c ). To minimize toxicity caused by high concentrations of fenretinide, we combined a nontoxic dose of fenretinide (0.5 \u00b5M) with increasing amounts of ionomycin to mobilize additional Ca 2+ ions. Although ionomycin alone was sufficient to induce HIV reactivation (Extended Data Figure 5d ), the combination significantly increased the effect (~64-fold over fenretinide alone) with minimal cellular toxicity (Figure 5f and Extended Data Figure 5e ). These data support a model where FOXO1 interferes with potentially low-level continuous ER stress in resting T cells, suppressing activation of ATF4 and NFAT, thereby promoting HIV latency. Inhibition of FOXO1 activity unleashes ER stress signaling and calcium release, mobilizing the two transcription factors, which then activate the HIV-1 LTR and reverse viral latency (Figure 5g ).",

Prolonged ER stress is associated with calcium release, and the ER-resident chaperone binding immunoglobulin protein (BiP), an important sensor of unfolded proteins, is itself calcium-regulated 67 . It remains unknown what causes ER stress, unleashed after FOXO1 inhibition, in quiescent T cells, but every protein that enters the ER can potentially trigger a response. PERK is one of three sensors in the ER and when nonactivated it is maintained in a monomeric state, bound to BIP. When BiP senses the accumulation of mis-folded proteins, it dissociates from PERK, allowing the kinase to dimerize and trans-autophosphorylate 68 . Phosphorylated PERK promotes phosphorylation of eIF2\u03b1, which impairs translation of most mRNAs, with the exception of a few transcripts like ATF4 that are specifically expressed because of the presence of multiple open reading frames in the 5' untranslated regions 69 .",

An important aspect is that the cytolytic activity of CD8 + T cells, key contributors to a successful \"shock and kill\" strategy, is strengthened by treatment with the FOXO1 inhibitor 15 , in contrast to HDAC inhibitors, which suppress CD8 + T cell activity 72 .

Subsequently, samples were incubated with MNase (New England Biolabs) for 30 min at 37\u00b0C. The reaction was quenched with 0.5 M EDTA and incubated on ice for 5 min. Nuclei were lysed (1% SDS, 10 mM EDTA, 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.1, protease inhibitors), and chromatin DNA was sheared to 200-1,000 bp average size through sonication (Ultrasonic Processor CP-130, Cole Parmer). Cellular debris was pelleted, and the supernatant was recovered. Lysates were incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C with 5 \u03bcg antibody against RNA Pol II (39097, Active Motif), RelA (A301-824A, Bethyl), ATF4 (11815, Cell Signaling), NFAT1 (ab2722, Abcam), or IgG control (P120-101, Bethyl). After incubation with protein A/G Dynabeads for 2 h and washing three times with low salt buffer (0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 2 mM EDTA, 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.1, 150 mM NaCl), one time with high salt buffer (0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 2 mM EDTA, 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.1, 500 mM NaCl) and twice with TE-buffer (1 mM EDTA, 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.1), chromatin was eluted (1% SDS, 0.1M NaHCO3)and recovered with Agencourt AMPure XP beads (Beckman Coulter).
