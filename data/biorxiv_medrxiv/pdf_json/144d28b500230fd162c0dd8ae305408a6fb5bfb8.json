In addition, no-root phylogenetic tree of the 622 SARS-CoV-2 genomes were constructed by maximum likelihood (ML) with the bootstrap value of 100. According to the phylogenetic trees, all genomes were divided into Cluster 1 to 3, in which genomes were mainly from North America, global and Europe respectively. Further we find 9 key specific sites of highly linkage which play a decisive role in the classification of each cluster. Among them, 3 and 4 sites of almost complete linkage are the specific sites for Cluster 1 and Cluster 3 respectively. Notably the frequencies of haplotype TTTG and H1 are generally high in European countries and correlated to death rate (r>0.4) based on more than 3500 SARS-CoV-2 genomes, which indicated that the haplotypes might be related to pathogenicity of SARS-CoV-2 and need to be addressed. According to haplotype changes in chronological order, the H3 haplotype subgroup disappeared soon after detection, while H1 haplotype subgroup was globally increasing with time. The evolution and molecular characteristics of more than 3500 genomic sequences provided a new perspective for",

The same phenomenon was also found in 4 specific sites of Cluster 3, and haplotype CCCA and TTTG accounted for 97.68% of all the 4 site haplotypes. Intriguingly, the 9 specific sites were still highly linkage, and four haplotypes, including TTCTCACGT (H1), CCCCCACAT (H2), CCTCTGTAC (H3) and CCTCCACAC (H4), accounted for 95.89% of all the 9 site haplotypes. The frequencies of each site and main haplotype for each country were showed in Fig 3 and Extended Data Table   4 . The data of 3624 genomes showed that the haplotype TTTG of the 4 specific sites in Cluster 3 had existed globally at present, and still exhibited high frequencies in most European countries but quite low in Asian countries. While the haplotype TGT of the 3 specific sites in Cluster 1 existed almost only in North America and Australia.

With the further outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 in the world, further understanding on the evolution and molecular characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 based on a large number of genome sequences will help us cope better with the challenges brought by SARS-CoV-2. In the present study, we estimated the Ka/Ks ratio and tMRCA of SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, and constructed the phylogenetic tree of SARS-CoV-2 genomes. As a result, we found that 9 specific sites of highly linkage could play a decisive role in the classification of SARS-CoV-2, and the haplotype TTTG might be related to pathogenicity of SARS-CoV-2 based on more than 3500 genomes.

The average Ka/Ks for all the coding sequences of 622 and 3624 SARS-CoV-2 genomes was 1.008 and 1.009, which was significantly higher than those of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, indicating that the SARS-CoV-2 was going through a neutral evolution. In general, SARS-CoV would show purifying selection pressures and the Ka/Ks would go down at the middle or end of the epidemic 25 . Therefore, it seemed to be reasonable considering that SARS-CoV-2 was under an exponential growth period around the world. Interestingly, we also found that the subgroups of different haplotypes (H1, H2, H3 and H4) seemed to experience different evolutionary patterns according to their Ka/Ks. The H3 haplotype subgroup disappeared soon after detection (2020-02-18 to 2020-04-07) (2020-02-18 to 2020-04-07, Fig 4a) , while H1 haplotype subgroup was globally increasing with time, these evolution and changes should be considered in developing therapeutic drugs and vaccines as soon as possible.

The cluster result was similar to our study: both the samples in Cluster A and our Cluster 1 were mainly from the United States; the samples in Cluster C and our Cluster 3 were mainly from European countries, while Cluster B and our Cluster 2 were mainly from China and the other regions. It was interesting that the markers in Cluster B (T8782C and C28144T) were also found in our study, but the other markers in Cluster A (T29095C) and Cluster C (G26144T) were not significantly in our study. That may be caused by different sample sizes and different constructing methods of phylogenetic tree. Based on the base substitution model, the ML method avoids the possible \"long-branch attraction\" problem in the maximum parsimony method and is faster than the Bayesian method 29 , hence it could be used as a reliable method for phylogenetic analysis. Nowadays, there is still a shortage of studies on phylogenetic analysis of SARS-CoV-2. Some studies used the genome of bat SARS-like-CoV 30 , RaTG13 30 or MT019529 from Wuhan (https://bigd.big.ac.cn/ncov/tree) as the root of phylogenetic tree. Unfortunately, there was no obvious evidence showing that SARS-CoV-2 was from the bat coronavirus even the identity between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 was up to 96.2% 5 . In our study, the tMRCA of SARS-CoV-2 was inferred on the late September 2019, which indicated there might exist an earlier SARS-CoV-2 strain we didn't find. Then in the case of unclear source of SARS-CoV-2 and high homology of its genomes (> 99.9% homology), it may be inappropriate to identify the evolutionary characteristics inside the genomes by taking bat SARS-like-CoV, RaTG13 or MT019529 as root. Therefore, the maximum likelihood method was used in current study to construct a no-root tree to obtain the reliable clusters with different characteristics. Based on the no-root tree, we identified 9 specific sites of highly linkage that play a decisive role in the classification of clusters successfully. Among the four main haplotypes, H1 and H3 were in Cluster 3 and Cluster 1, respectively, while there were two haplotypes H2 and H4 in Cluster 2 (Fig 1, Extended Data Fig 3b) .",

In order to make frequency relatively credible, we selected countries with more than 10 genomes (except South Korea with 16 genomes, all the other countries with more than 20 genomes) to analyze the correlation between frequencies of haplotypes and death rate.
