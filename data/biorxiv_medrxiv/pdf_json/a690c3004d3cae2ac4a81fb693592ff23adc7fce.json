There are numerous high-risk people in close contact with the confirmed patients. As we all know, interdicting transmission is the most effective way to control the epidemic of COVID-19. Under current situation for surgeons, infectious acute abdomen is still one of the most common surgery emergencies, the patients of which often have fever, diarrhea and other atypical symptom, and also have similar change of blood routine and other biochemistry items with COVID-19 for infectious or chemical peritonitis 6 . Hence, when surgeons managing patients of infectious acute abdomen, the typical symptoms and blood test indicators of COVID-19 are easy to be covered up. Currently, diagnosis of COVID-19 mainly depends on severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) nucleicacid detection 7 . However, the approach has defects of time-consuming and false-negative results 8 , which go against the urgency of emergency operation and the aim to avoid cross infection in the hospital, and therefore, there is a pressing need of an easier and more feasible method to distinguish the genuine COVID-19 patients among the infectious acute abdomen patients with mimical symptoms.",

Excessive precaution would cause huge waste of precious medical resource. On the contrary, negligence of necessary screening would fling medical staff into great risk of infection. The current screening procedures, such as nucleicacid detection and CT, have the defects of unsatisfactory accuracy and time-consuming. Consequently, a more convenient, efficient, economical and effective COVID-19 screening method is surgeons' desideratum. To our knowledge, this study provided the first screening model and scale for surgeons to distinguish infectious acute abdomen patients from suspected and high risk of COVID-19 patients in emergency department by retrospectively comparing demographic, clinical and laboratory characteristics of the two groups of patients.

The mixture of fever and some digestive symptoms mimics the symptoms of infectious acute abdomen to a great extent.Similarly, if the patient is elder or the abdominal infection develops into systemic infection, signs of pneumonia will emerge in infectious acute abdomen patients as well. For infectious acute abdomen, increased morbidity and mortality associated with a delay in the treatment of many of the surgical causes argue for an aggressive and expeditious surgical approach 15 . In the epidemic, quick and accurate screening in infectious acute abdomen patients suspected of COVID-19 is vitally important. The definite diagnosis of COVID-19 is still mainly depends on a positive RT-PCR result for SARS-CoV-2 16 , which has the shortage of possibility of false-negative caused by various reasons, such as disease stage, virus load and sample quality. In our COVID-19 cohort, the positive rate at the first time of nucleicacid detection is merely 43.7% (255/584). Meanwhile, chest CT was also considered as a good tool to screen. However, mild patients without pneumonia, atypical imaging findings and great dependence on physicians' experience limit the screening value of chest CT. A study enrolled in 1014",
