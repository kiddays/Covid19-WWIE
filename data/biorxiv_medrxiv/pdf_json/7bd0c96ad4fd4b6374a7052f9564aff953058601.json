This is done based on the data for the number of daily infections. Studying the history of predictions made, we attempt to estimate their reliability concerning the future course of the epidemic. We validate this procedure using data for the case numbers in China and South Korea. Then we apply it in order to find predictions for Germany, Italy and the United States. The results are encouraging, but no final judgment on the validity of the procedure can yet be made.",

In this work we presume that there is a factor, country-specific, but constant in time, between the reported and the actual number of cases. If this assumption were valid, the total number of infected individuals would be off by this very factor. However, other parameters, like the point in time when the peak in the numbers of daily infections would occur, or the following rate of decay of these numbers, would not be affected.

These countries can be considered to be in earlier stages of the epidemic. In these cases, the modeling agrees very well with the data, too. Interestingly, a prominent decline in daily cases is predicted for Germany, while for Italy and the United States, the daily cases are predicted to remain at a high level.
