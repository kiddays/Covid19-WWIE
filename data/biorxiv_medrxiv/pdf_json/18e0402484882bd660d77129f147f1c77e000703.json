All of these studies 220 employed same methods and hence are comparable. When we compare the estimates for the 221 most affected areas across different countries, the rate in Madrid in Spain (38.4%) is higher 222 than that estimated for Wuhan in China (12.2%) [4], Daegu in Korea (2.4%) [26] and 223 Northwest, Italy (23.0%) [12]. This difference across countries and regions may be partly 224 explained by differences in population age structure, density, other socio-demographic factors, 225 and the scale of the pandemic in different areas. The median age in Spain (44.9 years) [27] is 226 comparable to that of Italy (45.4 years) but higher than that for China (36.7 years) [28]. Indeed, 227 the elderly population is at risk of severe outcomes from COVID-19 [29-31], which could 228 partly explain the higher severity observed for Italy and Spain. Other factors that could have 229 played a role in these differences may be related to differences in the definition of COVID-19 230 death, and differences in testing strategies. For example, in Korea extensive testing and 231 rigorous contact tracing strategy were implemented [32] while testing prioritized more severe 232",
