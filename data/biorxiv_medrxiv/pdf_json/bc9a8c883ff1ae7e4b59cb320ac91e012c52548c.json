Data on environmental pollution in Italy were retrieved from the 2019 annual report of the organization Legambiente (League for the Ambient).

Living in a province with over 100 days per year in which environmental pollutants were exceeded was found to be associated with a nearly 3-fold higher risk of being positive for COVID-19 (0.014 vs. 0.005 COVID-19 cases per 1000 inhabitants; OR, 2.96; 95% 2.12-4.13; p<0.001).

Though nearly all countries across the globe have now been virtually involved, the burden of disease seems to progress heterogeneously among different countries and territories. For example, Remuzzi and colleagues recently highlighted that some parts of Italy, especially the Lombardy region, are experiencing a considerably vaster outbreak compared to other areas of the country (Remuzzi and Remuzzi, 2020) . Since several lines of evidence also attest that this Italian territory has an extraordinarily high level of environmental pollution (Carugno et al., 2017) , we aimed to explore the potential epidemiological association between the number of cases of COVID-19 and environmental pollution in Italy.",

Severe acute respiratory disease coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the microorganism responsible for COVID-19, is a respiratory virus, which mostly infects type 2 pneumocytes, causing a severe form of interstitial pneumonia, occasionally evolving to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) (Remuzzi and Remuzzi, 2020) . Previous studies have highlighted the existence of a significant association between air pollutants exposure and enhanced risk of developing respiratory viral infections (Ciencewicki and Jaspers, 2007) , such that there is no reason to think that COVID-19 will be an exception. Moreover, according to National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), China's air pollution has significantly dropped during the coronavirus outbreak, with carbon emissions dropping by 25% (https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/blogs/earthmatters/2020/03/05/howthe-coronavirus-is-and-isnot-affecting-the-environment/). These decreases in air pollution parallel the decline in the number of cases in that country. Interestingly, the Copernicus Sentinel-5P satellite of the European Space Agency (ESA) has also detected a dramatic decline in air pollution over northern Italy following lockdown (https://www.esa.int/ESA_Multimedia/Videos/2020/03/Coronavirus_nitrogen_dioxide_emissions _drop_over_Italy). Hopefully, this will correspond to a definitive decline in the number of cases.",
