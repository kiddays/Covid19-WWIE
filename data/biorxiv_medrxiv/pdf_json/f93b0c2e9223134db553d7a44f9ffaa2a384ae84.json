[1] It has rapidly spread to other cities and countries outside Wuhan and has become a global health crisis. As the disease progresses, more and more characteristics about the disease are known to us. Up to now, there are still no specific drugs, mainly supporting treatment in clinic. A large number of studies have shown that the main symptom of this disease was fever, cough and dyspnea. [2] [3] [4] [5] Some articles have described the disease in details. Huang gastrointestinal symptoms and proposed that non-classical symptoms have been overlooked, posing a threat to the public. [6] Wu et al discussed that older people (\u226565 years old) with greater risk of development of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and death. [7] Guo et al found that diabetes is a risk factor for the patients with COVID-19. [8] However, few studies took prospective study to explore the short-term outcomes of severe ill patients under current medical treatment and the risk factors that affect the short-term outcomes of severe ill patients, especially pneumonia patients with certain chronic diseases, which accounted for the majority of deaths. Here, we used a single-centered, prospective method to describe the basic clinical characteristics and short-term outcomes of severe patients in Union hospital, Wuhan, were collected until the day of death or discharge or for the first 28 days after severe ill diagnosis, whichever was shorter. All missing or vague data, direct communications with patients and their families. All data were finally checked by two physicians (Xiaobo Feng and Liang Ma) and a third researcher (Wei Yang) adjudicated any difference in interpretation between the two primary reviewers.",

Studies had shown that 20% of COVID-19 patients developed to critically disease due to hypoxia or respiratory failure, among them, 5% needed to treat in intensive care unit and 15% required oxygen and essential care. This suggests that this is particularly important in understanding this part of the patient. [9] [10] Recently, Dong et al found that children, in particular, infants developed into severe outcomes. This indicated that patients of any age could develop to severe illness. [11] Feng et al found that severe and critical patients with the typical characteristics of multiple organ and immune function dysfunction. They also found that older people with age ( \u2265 75 years) was a risk factor for mortality.",

Fatality risk of COVID-19 patients with or without history of previous cardiovascular disease may the acute cardiac injury and heart failure. [18] Costanza Emanueli et al suggested that the COVID-19 crisis will have a longer term residual repercussions on the cardiovascular system. [21] This suggestion that the cardiac injury also requires special attention. In our study, we also found that lactate concentration was higher in poor outcome than their counterpart. As with all known, lactate is generally the end product of energy through anaerobic metabolism, and the elevation of lactate level is mainly caused by the increase of blood oxygen deficiency and anaerobic metabolism, this result is consistent with the lower oxygen saturation in poor group, this indicated that lactate level was an important predictors of poor outcome in the early stage. In addition, total bilirubin was also an important predictor of poor outcome in the early stage. Qi recommend that dynamic monitor the liver function of patients is necessary. [22] Cai conclude that patients with abnormal liver function may had higher risks to progress to severe disease.

Meantime, the risk factors related to the poor outcome included uncontrolled inflammation responses, infection, liver and kidney, cardiac dysfunction and hypoxia. The pathogenesis of COVID-19 is still studying. Cytokine storm and uncontrolled inflammation responses are thought to play important roles in the outcome of COVID-19.[26-30] External stimuli resulted to excessive immune response and the pathogenesis of the cytokine storm is complex which leaded to rapid disease progresses and high mortality. The inflammatory cytokine storm is closely correlated to the development and progression of ARDS.[31] Neutrophils play important role in chemokines and cytokines.[32] In our study, poor outcome had significantly higher neutrophil counts than good outcome group, which may leading to the cytokine storm. In addition, CD8+ T cells were significantly lower in poor outcome group. These results mean the important roles of CD8 T cells in COVID-19. Studies had shown that T-cell could inhibit the over-activation of innate immunity.[33] T cells can help to clear the SARS-CoV, and low T-cell response can result in pathological changes in mice with SARS-CoV.[34] The relevant mechanisms need to be further studied. This study has some limitations. First, owing to the limited number of cases, only 114 severe patients were included. Second, this study was a single-center research and a larger cohort study of severe patients with SARS-CoV-2 from other cities in China and other countries would help to further describe the clinical characteristics and predict the risk factors about this disease.",
