Hypertension has been proposed to promote key factors which may predispose to 12 infection via several potential mechanisms. (1) Hypertensive stimuli promote dysregulation of 13 the adaptive immune response. Chronic angiotensin II infusions in mice increase markers of T 14 lymphocyte activation and perivascular adipose infiltration 29 . Additional murine studies have 15 indicated that monocytes and neutrophils may be key factors in angiotensin II-mediated 16 hypertension and resultant vascular dysfunction 30 31 . A recent Mendelian randomisation study 17 supported a causal relationship between blood pressure and subsequent alteration in 18 neutrophil, monocyte, and eosinophil indices 32 .

Our study extends these observations to show that increased blood pressure 7 may causally lead to increased pulmonary obstruction representing a putative mechanism 8 toward heightened pneumonia risk. Together, these studies and others suggest several 9 mechanisms which may link hypertension and pulmonary obstruction: 1) both may involve 10 physiological degradation of arterial and airway elasticity 37 , 2) endothelial and vascular 11 dysfunction may also influence pulmonary vascular endothelial cells and lead to pulmonary 12 vascular dysfunction resulting in lung tissue destruction and airway obstruction 40 , and 3) 13 systemic inflammation associated with hypertension may additionally alter pulmonary since our results are consistent with a causal relationship between blood pressure and 17 pneumonia risk, blood pressure optimization is anticipated to reduce pneumonia risk in the 18 population orthogonal to other strategies aimed at reducing infection risk.
