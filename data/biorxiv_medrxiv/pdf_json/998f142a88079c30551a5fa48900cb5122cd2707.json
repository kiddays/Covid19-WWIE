The structural research on the receptor recognition by SARS-CoV has identified the key interactions between SARS-CoV spike protein and its host receptor, also known as angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). It controls both the cross-species and humanto-human transmissions of SARS-CoV. In this article, we have considered the infection dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the acute stage. Our aim is to propose and analyse a mathematical model for investigating the effect of CTL responses over the viral mutation to control the viral infection when a post-infection vaccine is administered at regular intervals. Dynamics of the system with and without impulses have been analysed using qualitative theory. Main findings are supported through numerical simulations.",

Angiotensic converting enzyme II (ACE2) receptor of epithelial cells plays an important role in cellular entry [3, 8] . It has been observed that ACE2 could be expressed in the oral cavity. ACE2 receptors are higher in tongue than buccal and gingival tissues. These findings imply that the mucosa of the oral cavity may be a potentially high-risk route of COVID-19 infection. Thus epithelial cells of the tongue are the major routes of entry for COVID-19. Zhou et al. [3] also reported that SARS-CoV-2 spikes S bind with ACE2 receptor of epithelial cells with high affinity. The bonding between S -spike of SARS-CoV-2 with ACE2 [8] , results from the fusion between the viral envelope and the target cell membrane and the epithelial cells become infected. The S protein plays a major role in the induction of protective immunity during the infection of SARS-CoV-2 by eliciting neutralization antibody and T cell responses [9] . S protein is not only capable of neutralizing antibody but it also contains several immunogenic T cell epitopes. Some of the epitopes found in either S1 or S2 domain. These proteins are useful for SARS-CoV-2 vaccine development [13] .",

Also, CTL responses help to resolve infection and virus persistence caused by weak CTL responses. Antibody responses against SARS-CoV-2 play an important role in preventing the viral entry process [9] . Hsueh et al. [4] found that antibodies block viral entry by binding to the S glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2. To fight against the pathogen SARS-CoV-2, the body requires SARS-CoV-2 specific CD4 + T helper cells for developing this specific antibody [9] . Antibody-mediated immunity protection helps the anti-SARS-CoV serum to neutralize COVID 19 infection. Besides that, the role of T cell responses in COVID-19 infection is very much important. Cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) responses are important for recognizing and killing infected cells, particularly in the lungs [9] . But the kinetic of the CTL responses and antibody responses during SARS-CoV-2 infection is yet to be explored. Our study will focus on the role CTL and its possible implication on treatment and vaccine development. Vaccine that stimulates the CTL responses represents the best hope for control of COVID 19. Here we have modelled the situation where CTLs can effectively control the viral infection when the post infection vaccine is administered at regular intervals.",

In the absence of vaccination we observe that the CTL count approaches a stable equilibrium. Under regular vaccinations, the CTL count oscillates in an impulsive periodic orbit.

To reactivate the CTL responses during the acute infection period, vaccination is delivered to the host system in an impulsive mode. The new CTL vaccination when administered, the best possible CTL responses can act against the infected or virus-producing cells to neutralize infection. This particular situation can keep the infected cell population at a very low level. In the proposed mathematical model, we have analyzed the optimal dosing regimen for which infection can be controlled. From this study, it has been observed that when the basic reproduction ratio lies below one, we expect the system to attain its disease-free state. However, the system switches from disease-free state to CTL-free equilibrium state when 1 < R 0 < 2.957. If R 0 > 2.957, the CTL-free equilibrium moves to a coexisting endemic state (from Figure 1) .",

Also if the treatment regimen is not adjusted properly, the therapy is not effective at all. This approach might also be applicable to a combination of antiviral therapy. Future extension work of the combination of drug therapy should also include more realistic patterns of non-adherence (random drug holidays, imperfect timing of successive doses), more accurate intracellular pharmacokinetics and leads towards better estimates of drug dosage and drug dosing intervals.",
