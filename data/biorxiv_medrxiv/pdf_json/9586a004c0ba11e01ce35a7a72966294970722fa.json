The outbreak of COVID-19 in Hubei province from the end of 2019 to the beginning of 2020 has obvious correlation to meteorological factors. By using the Spearman rank correlation coefficient, it discussed the correlation between daily incremental cases and meteorological factors in Hubei province. The results showed that the average temperature, the minimum temperature, WVP and air pressure were significantly correlated with the daily incremental cases.

The unary linear regression results showed that the minimum temperature increased by 1\u00b0C and the incremental cases decreased by 72 cases. This is consistent with studies of other respiratory viral infectious diseases. Studies have reported that SARS-CoV is sensitive to temperature and relatively stable at low temperatures. Higher relative humidity (RH)(>95%) and high temperature (e.g. 38\u00b0C) has synergistic effect on the inactivation of SARS-CoV activity, while lower temperature and lower humidity can prolong the survival time of virus on contaminated surface (Chan et al.,2011) . The number of daily SARS cases is negatively correlated with the highest and/or lowest temperature (Bi et al.,2007) , and the rate of SARS recurrence is also negatively correlated with the daily average temperature (Cai et al.,2007) . During the epidemic period, in the days with lower temperature, the risk of increasing the daily incidence of SARS is 18.18 times higher than that in the days with higher temperature (Lin et al.,2006) .

Every increase of 1\u00b0C in the diurnal temperature range caused COVID-19 mortality 2.92% increase (Ma et al.,2020) . Another study reported that the relationship between the average temperature and COVID-19 confirmed cases was approximately linear in the range of <3\u00b0C, while it tended to be flat above 3\u00b0C. When the average temperature is lower than 3\u00b0C, the number of confirmed cases per day increases by 4.861% (95% CI:3.209% ~6.513%) (Xie & Zhu, 2020) . This result is contrary to our result. This study used daily confirmed cases and meteorological data (37 days in total) from multiple onset areas (122 cities) from January 23 to February 29, 2020. The difference is that two-month interval of observation included 53 days effective data, and we only use the data of Hubei province (including Wuhan, Xiaogan, Huanggang, and other a total of 17 cities or regions), covering a total of 67773 confirmed cases.",

After that, causal analysis of global influenza incidence data shows that temperature change and low AH are more likely to lead to changes in influenza activity than actual low temperature.

Studies in tropical/subtropical regions of China have found that, WVP was negatively correlated with the incidence ofH1N1pdm09 (Influenza A) and Yamagata (Influenza B) (Pan et al., 2019) .

This undoubtedly brought new challenges to RH and respiratory virus survival and transmission. The relevant mechanism of WVP may be due to the degeneration of virus lipoprotein. Higher level of WVP will lead to surface inactivation of lipid-containing virus (Yang et al.,2012) , it is related to the phase transition of phospholipid bilayer membrane, which causes the peptide to cross-link at the air-water interface. However, there is still a lack of comprehensive understanding of the mechanism of WVP affecting virus survival (Peci et al.,2019) .",

According to the analysis of its relevant mechanism, non-enveloped viruses (HRV and HEV) that cause respiratory tract infection may spread through close contact or droplet, rather than mainly through aerosol, therefore, the transmission and survival of the virus are relatively less dependent on meteorological factors (Sundell et al.,2016) . However, enveloped virus (influenza, RSV, SARS-CoV, 2019-nCoV) has greater dependence on meteorological factors. At the same time, previous studies have shown that envelope protein (E) of coronavirus causing severe acute respiratory syndrome is directly related to virus virulence (Schoeman & Fielding.2019) . We believe that envelope proteins that may be closely related to 2019-nCov pathogenicity are sensitive to minimum temperature and WVP, and they are more vulnerable to climatic factors, especially temperature (including average temperature and minimum temperature) and WVP.

Atmospheric pressure is the air weight over unit area, i.e. air density. When the human body expels respiratory viruses, the increase of atmospheric pressure may lead to the decrease of the diffusion range of liquid drops and the increase of the number of viruses per unit area. As the infectivity of viruses depends on the number of viruses per unit area, if the concentration per unit area of the virus is insufficient due to the increase of atmospheric pressure in the transmission of RSV, infection will not occur. Similarly, high diffusion may produce low concentrations of infectious particles(Collins & Kennedy,1999).",

The significance of this work is that increasing the decline of cases may be affected by changes in meteorological factors that limit the ability of virus transmission. The differences in meteorological factors should be taken into account when predicting the epidemic scale during the global transmission of 2019-nCoV and formulating prevention and control strategies. Secondly, we analyzed the possible relationship between meteorological factors and COVID-19 attacks from epidemiological statistics, as well as the influence of meteorological parameters on the transmission and survival of viruses causing respiratory diseases, and analyzed its possible mechanism. We demonstrated the epidemiological correlation between WVP and COVID-19. At the same time, we speculate that compared with non-enveloped virus, enveloped virus\" 2019-nCoV\" is more sensitive to climatic factors, especially temperature (including average temperature and minimum temperature).Third, meteorological factors may be one of the influencing factors causing the 2019-nCoV epidemic. The study used a linear regression model to explain the relationship between incremental cases and the lowest temperature. The results show that for Hubei province (epidemic area), for every 1\u00b0C increase in the lowest temperature, 72 incremental cases are reduced, and when the lowest temperature reaches 22\u00b0C, the increased cases are significantly reduced. Therefore, it is speculated that in other epidemic areas in the world, if the minimum temperature rises above a certain threshold, the number of new cases may drop dramatically.",
