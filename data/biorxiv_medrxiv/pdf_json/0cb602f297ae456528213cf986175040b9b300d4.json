            "text": "As most COVID-19 patients present with pneumonia, computed tomography (CT) scanning of the thorax could be helpful in screening and diagnosing. In addition, CT has the advantage that the results can be available almost directly (7, 8) . Chest CT can show characteristic findings including areas of ground-glass, with or without signs of reticulation (so called \"crazy paving pattern\"), consolidative pulmonary opacities in advanced stages and the \"reverse halo\" sign (3, (7) (8) (9) (10) (11) (12) . Since peripheral areas of ground glass are a hallmark of early COVID-19, which can easily be missed at chest X-rays, CT scanning has an advantage over chest X-rays in the early stages of COVID-19 (13) . Because COVID-19 related changes can indeed be found on CT scans, some studies suggest that CT scanning could be helpful in discriminating between COVID-19 positive and COVID-19 negative patients at the ED (8, (13) (14) (15) (16) . The value of CT is, however, debated because of suspected lack of discriminatory value (17) (18) (19) (20) (21) . Complicating this debate, is that the sensitivity of PCR may be suboptimal, which makes it difficult to compare the two tests (5) . Furthermore, the added value of a diagnostic test is effected by the prevalence of disease and data on the performance of CT in a population with a moderate prevalence of COVID-19 are scarce.",

Sensitivity of the CT was higher in patients with more severe disease -high CURB-65 score (\u22653) or sepsis (SOFA \u22652) -than in those who were less severely ill. In 77% of all patients, the results of the chest CT and the PCR test were concordant, however in 11% of patients with a positive PCR, CT scans were not considered suspicious for COVID-19. In addition, in about a third of patients tested negative by PCR, the CT was positive. Most of these patients had a discharge diagnosis of pneumonia (74%), which was caused by another viral pathogen in one fourth of patients, but in 20%, COVID-19 could not be excluded.",

This is why we included repeated PCRs and explored discordant test results, which showed that in about 26% of patients with false positive CT scans, other viral pathogens were detected. This study was performed at the end of the respiratory virus season, and the added value of the CT scan might be lower during typical respiratory virus season. It can be argued, in addition, that with increasing incidence of COVID-19, and thus, a higher pre-test probability, the added value of the CT scan will decrease. In other studies, the sensitivity of chest CT for COVID-19 was found to be higher, up to 97% in a study with 1014 Chinese patients, but at the cost of low specificity (25%) (14) . In another study in 81 Chinese patients with PCR proven COVID-19, sensitivity was 93% (10) . A lower sensitivity of 80% was reported in 30 symptomatic cruise ship passengers (17) . In contrast, PCR was found to be negative in 71% of 51 Chinese patients, of whom 98% had CT abnormalities (15) .
