Comparisons between geographic areas utilizing unweighted surveillance data is not appropriate, so this investigation focuses on characterizing each state's population individually. CDC influenza surveillance data was deemed unreliable by investigators after MMWR week 12 (March 22, 2020), and at time of writing, FluView has been abbreviated for the remaining season [13] .",

Excess pneumonia mortality likewise suggests an increase in severe respiratory infections, presumably COVID-19. Colorado's epidemiologic profile in particular demonstrates a concerning discrepancy between influenza like illness disease burden and reported incidence of COVID-19.",
