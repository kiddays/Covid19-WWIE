The review of evidence is essential to guide preventive action and therapy. 49 B. What are the key findings? 50 Fetal distress and preterm delivery seem to be more frequent among women. Also, evidence on vertical transmission is emerging but the clinical relevance of 52 the fetal infection remains unclear. No evidence links the SARS-CoV-2 virus to 53 transmission via breast milk. 54 C. What does this study add to what is already known? 55 The comprehensive review of 212 pregnant women with COVID-19, summarizes the 56 evidence on vertical transmission, as well as adverse maternal and neonatal outcomes.",

This study reviews knowledge on the impact of 63 COVID-19 on pregnancy and describes the outcome of published cases of pregnant 64 women diagnosed with COVID-19, as well as the characteristics of COVID-19 positive 65 women who delivered in Portugal by 31 of March 2020. 66 Methods: Searches were conducted in PubMed\u00ae up to 8 April 2020, using PRISMA 67 standards, to identify original published studies describing pregnant women at any 68 gestational age diagnosed COVID-19. There were no date or language restrictions on the 69 search. All identified studies were included irrespective of assumptions on study quality. 70 Portuguese cases were ascertained by contact with all Portuguese maternities and based 71 on the information provided by their health professionals. 72 Results: We identified 30 original studies reporting 212 cases of pregnant women with 73 COVID-19 (30 discharged while pregnant), 200 from China and 12 from other countries. 74 The 182 published deliveries resulted in one stillbirth and 185 live births. Four women 75 with severe COVID-19 required admission to an intensive care unit but no cases of 76 maternal death were reported. There was one neonatal death. Preterm births occurred in 77 28.7% of cases, but it is unclear whether this was iatrogenic. All cases with amniotic fluid, 78 placenta, and/or cord blood analyzed for the SARS-CoV-2 virus were negative. Four 79 newborns were positive for SARS-CoV-2 and three newborns had high levels of IgM 80 antibodies. None of the first eight infants born in Portugal tested positive. Breast milk 81 samples from 13 mothers and described in seven studies showed no evidence of SARS-82 CoV-2. : medRxiv preprint 5 Conclusion: The evidence related to the effect of COVID-19 on pregnant women is still 84 limited. Pregnant women and newborns should be considered particularly vulnerable 85 populations regarding COVID-19 prevention and management strategies. 86 87 Keywords: 88 361",
