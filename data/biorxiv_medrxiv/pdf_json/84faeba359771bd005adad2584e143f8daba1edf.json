To assess the disease severity (non-severe or severe) and the progression, two imaging bio-markers were automatically computed, i.e., the portion of infection (POI) and the average infection HU (iHU).

            "text": "Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has rapidly spread all over the world since the end of 2019, 2 and 1, 436, 198 cases have been confirmed as COVID-19 to date (9 April 2020) [1] . 3 Reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) is used as the standard diagnostic 4 method. However, it suffers from low sensitivities as report in [2, 3] . Computed tomography (CT) 5 imaging is often adopted to confirm the COVID-19 in China and some European countries, e.g., 6 Netherlands. CT plays a key role in the diagnosis and treatment assessment of COVID-19 due to its 7 high sensitivity [2, 4] . 8 The explosive growing number of COVID-19 patients requires the automated AI-based computer 9 aided diagnosis (CAD) systems that can accurately and objectively detect the disease infected lung 10 regions, assess the severity and the progressions. Recently, several deep learning based AI systems 11 were developed to differentiate the COVID-19 and community acquired pneumonia (CAP) [5] or 12 other viral pneumonia [6, 7] , and to quantify the infection regions [8, 9, 10, 11] . However, all these 13 previous AI systems built upon the high resolution thin-section CT images, which have high 14 radiation doses and require higher costs. In contrast, the thick-section CT images from affordable 15 CT scanners has relatively low radiation doses and are popularly used in hospitals worldwide, 16 especially in primary care. Hence, it is worthwhile to develop an AI-based CAD system using the 17 thick-section CT images. 18 In this study, we developed a fully automated AI system to quantify COVID-19 associated lung 19 abnormalities, assess the disease severity and the disease progressions using thick-section chest CT 20 images. Specifically, the lung and infection regions were first segmented by a deep learning based 21 model, where the labels came from another multi-center annotated CAP CT dataset knowing that 22 COVID-19 shares similar abnormal lung patterns with other pneumonia such as ground glass opacity 23 (GGO), consolidation, bilateral infiltration, etc. Using the lung and infection segmentation masks, 24 we computed the portion of infection (POI) and the average infection HU (iHU) as two imaging 25 bio-markers, which were applied to distinguish the COVID-19 severity. Moreover, the changes of 26 POI and iHU in patient's longitudinal CT scans were calculated to evaluate the COVID-19 27 progression. For evaluation, the AI based lung abnormalities segmentation was compared to two 28 experienced radiologists manually delineations, while the AI based assessment of disease severity and 29 progression was compared to patients diagnosis status extracted from clinical and radiology reports. 30 To the best of our knowledge, this is the first AI-based study to quantitatively assess the COVID-19 31 severity and disease progression using the thick-section CT images. China National Health Commission [12] , the severity of COVID-19 includes mild, common, severe 42 and critical types. Since there were few mild and critical cases, we categorized all the CT scans into 43 severe group (including severe and critical) and non-severe group (mild and common). In total, we 44 had 79 severe CT scans from 32 patients, and 452 general CT scans from 164 patients. It should be 45 noticed that some patients were in non-severe phase when they entered the hospital, but may 46 develop into severe phase during treatment. All the COVID-19 patients were used to test the AI 47 system performance. 48 ",

However, it is time consuming (or even 159 impractical) for radiologists to produce the quantitative measurements for this longitudinal analysis. 160 Our AI system provides a quantitative and objective measurement, i.e., the POI, which shows strong 161 agreement with radiologist qualitative judgements. More importantly, the AI based longitudinal 162 disease quantification is precise, reproducible and fast, which can reduce the reading time of 163 radiologists for COVID-19 each patient and improve the quality of the disease progression 164 assessment [10] . 165 This study has several limitations. Firstly, we only evaluated changes of imaging bio-markers at 166 the whole lung level in certain phrase. Although our model can compute the bio-markers at the lobe 167 level, the standard phrases from the radiology reports were mostly at the whole lung level. 168 Furthermore, some phrases in the reports like 'lesion absorption' might respond to either infection 169 region decreasing or HU value reduction. Thus it needs more sophisticated and precise analysis 170 evaluating our model in the future. Secondly, motion artifacts due to respiration and heart motion 171 may cause false positive segmentation in the AI system. We noticed that some false positive 172 segmentation affected the longitudinal infection evaluations6. One possible solution is to identity the 173 motion artifacts before applying the infection segmenting. Finally, our model was only tested the 174 COVID-19 positive patients. A recent study has shown that a deep learning based AI classification 175 model can detect the COVID-19 and distinguish it from the community acquired pneumonia and 176 other non-pneumonic lung diseases using thin-section HRCT [5] . As the next step, it would be 177 interesting to see if our model can also differentiate the pneumonia caused by COVID-19 and other 178 factors using the thick-section CT imaging.",
