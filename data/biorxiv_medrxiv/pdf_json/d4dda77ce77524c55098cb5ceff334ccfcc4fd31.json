A potential target for this strategy is human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1), for which, despite decades of efforts, no vaccine is available. In particular, a therapeutic vaccine devised to eliminate infected cells would represent a key component of cure strategies. HIV peptides designed based on individual viro-immunological data from people living with HIV/AIDS have recently shown able to induce post-therapy viral set point abatement. However, the reproducibility and scalability of this method is curtailed by the errors and arbitrariness associated with manual peptide design as well as by the time-consuming process. We herein introduce Custommune, a user-friendly web tool to design personalized and populationtargeted vaccines. When applied to HIV-1, Custommune predicted personalized epitopes using patient specific Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) alleles and viral sequences, as well as the expected HLA-peptide binding strength and potential immune escape mutations. Of note, Custommune predictions compared favorably with manually designed peptides administered in a recent phase II clinical trial (NCT02961829). Furthermore, we utilized Custommune to design preventive vaccines targeted for populations highly affected by COVID-19. The results allowed the identification of peptides tailored for each population and predicted to elicit both CD8 + T-cell immunity and neutralizing antibodies against structurally conserved epitopes of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Overall, our data describe a new tool for rapid development of personalized or population-based immunotherapy against chronic and acute viral infections. al.

Due to its potential for high selectivity and efficacy, immunotherapy is an optimal choice for the design of personalized therapeutic interventions 1 . While most efforts in this direction have focused on cancer 1-3 , viral infections can be a relevant application as well, particularly chronic infections characterized by extensive genetic diversity, in part due to in-host viral evolution. Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) is case in point, as the large number of circulating strains and its high replicative mutation rates have hampered the development of effective vaccines, both preventive and therapeutic 4, 5 . Several lines of evidence highlight the relevance of immune control in HIV-1 infection. Spontaneous long-term control of HIV-1 replication can be accompanied by the presence of broadly neutralizing antibodies 6, 7 or, more frequently, effective cell-mediated immune responses 8 . Moreover, protective Class I HLA alleles have been identified both in people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA) and macaques infected with the HIV homolog simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] . In line with this, temporary depletion of CD8 + T-cells is associated with a rapid viral load increase, while their replenishment can revert this effect [15] [16] [17] [18] .",

            "text": "A therapeutic vaccine based on cell-mediated immunity might offer the advantage of decreasing the number of infected cells. On the one hand, HIV-1 latently infected cells, which constitute the main barrier to a cure [19] [20] [21] , are not targeted by antiretroviral drugs or CD8 + T-cells 22 . On the other hand, effective cell-mediated immune responses could preserve drug-free control of the infection by keeping viral load low/undetectable and by eliminating the infected cells undergoing spontaneous HIV-1 reactivation from latency. Such therapeutic vaccines could also be combined with strategies aimed at purging the HIV-1 latent reservoirs by inducing pharmacologic reactivation of latently infected cells 23 . The strong correlation between the host's genetic background and immune-mediated control of the infection suggests that effective immunity is mainly directed against a subset of HIV-1 epitopes. Consistently, several studies have shown that cell-mediated immune responses against the HIV-1 Gag protein correlate with lower viral loads in PLWHA and with post-therapy control of the infection in macaques 18, [24] [25] [26] [27] . The peculiar efficacy of anti-Gag immunity might be partially explained by the higher fitness cost associated with mutations in this viral protein 28 . In particular, specific regions of Gag, which are essential for HIV-1 packaging and assembly, are structurally and evolutionarily conserved, displaying low Shannon entropy both in humans and primate lentiviruses 29 . However, it is noteworthy that low diversity is not sufficient per se to induce viral load control, as vaccine approaches designed exclusively by selecting epitopes based on their evolutionary conservation have shown only modest effects 30, 31 . A recent phase II clinical trial (NCT02961829) has attempted to induce anti-Gag immunity against conserved epitopes using a personalized approach based on patient HLA sequences 32 . Although the study enrolled only a small number of PLWHA and tested multiple interventions, preliminary results suggest that therapeutic vaccination with autologous dendritic cells pulsed with individually designed peptides decreased the viral set point in some patients during analytical treatment interruption (ATI) 32 . In the present work we describe and test a new automated, user-friendly web-based tool to design personalized peptides for vaccination. The tool, named Custommune, was principally interrogated to develop therapeutic vaccine candidates for HIV-1. To this aim, by intersecting input data from patient-specific viral sequences and HLA alleles, Custommune provides an output of epitopes of desired length filtered for their predicted specificity, immunogenicity and mutation potential. Of note, in our simulations, Custommune performance was superior to that of manual vaccine design (applied in clinical trial NCT02961829) in terms of prediction of clinical response. One advantage of Custommune over traditional vaccine design techniques is the ability to quickly adapt the tool for different targets and strategies. In this regard, we applied Custommune to the novel pandemic COVID19, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) 33 . Due to the acute manifestations of the disease, the design of a population-targeted preventive vaccine was chosen as a more practical approach as compared to a personalized therapeutic vaccine. Moreover, to broaden the expected coverage and increase the likelihood of achieving herd immunity 34 , a strategy able to potentially evoke both neutralizing antibodies and cell-mediated immunity was preferred. Using input regions of SARS-CoV-2 identified as viable targets, Custommune was able to design vaccine candidates specific for regionally prevalent HLA genotypes. In addition, Custommune selected those HLA Class II restricted epitopes that could induce neutralizing antibodies and thus provide a two-layered protection against the infection. Taken as a whole, our results show the potential of the Custommune algorithm to quickly design personalized or population-specific peptides for preventive and therapeutic vaccination. Due to its intuitive and scalable approach, Custommune might provide an effective tool for rapid vaccine development against chronic and acute conditions.",

            "text": "The Custommune web tool (available at: http://www.custommune.com) was written in Python (http://www.python.org) using the Django framework (https://www.djangoproject.com) and provides the user with an easy online interface for accessing and downloading prediction datasets without any coding knowledge requirements. The tool utilizes a pipeline ( Figure 1 ) to design epitopes for preventive and therapeutic vaccines. For HIV-1 therapeutic vaccine design, Custommune crosses input data from patient-specific viral sequences (DNA in FASTA format or raw DNA sequencing inputs) and patient's HLA-I and/or HLA-II alleles, providing an output of epitopes of desired k-mer length. To facilitate the allele input step, the tool provides two links directing the user to a list of supported Class I and Class II HLA alleles, respectively. These lists mirror those of the netMHCpan 4.0 algorithm 35 , for either HLA class. Although the approach could potentially be extended to encompass entire HIV-1 sequences, we decided to limit the search for viable epitopes to the gag gene only, because of the previously described distinctive efficacy of anti-Gag cell-mediated immunity 18, [24] [25] [26] [27] . The tool pipeline ( Figure 1 ) starts by translating input gag genomic sequences to protein sequences. Custommune then performs multiple sequence alignment using the Clustal Omega (REST) web service Python client 36 and builds a consensus translated sequence. The consensus sequence is then used to predict epitopes restricted to patient-specific HLA-alleles for both classes. The HLA-specific epitopes provided as final output by Custommune are pre-filtered by the algorithm. This pre-filtering follows a set of parameters that compute epitope affinity in terms of sequence variation and conservation degree, allele-restricted affinities, and previous clinical evidence of immune response ( Figure 1 ). For calculating evolutionary conservation, each epitope is compared, in terms of similarity, to an internal database of Gag amino acid sequences (Supplementary File 1) collected mainly from curated alignments retrieved from the Los Alamos HIV sequence database (http://www.hiv.lanl.gov/). Moreover, to verify whether antigenicity has already been reported for the candidate epitopes, the tool compares potential epitopes to those already described in the Los Alamos HIV immunology site (http://www.hiv.lanl.gov/content/immunology). To further refine the structural assessment of epitope binding to HLA-alleles, Custommune performs structural epitope modelling followed by epitope-HLA docking to determine the structural stability of the HLA-predicted epitope binding ( Figure 1 ). The Custommune pipeline also computes some related physicochemical parameters of the personalized epitope sequence to aid in the assessment of the structural stability of candidate peptides. Overall, the tool is optimized to identify immunogenic peptides characterized by the lowest variability (mutation potential). In line with this, the tool specifically highlights potential epitopes that are contained in regions which were previously described as essential for viral fitness 29, 37 . This is a novel and fundamental feature of this approach, as RNA viruses are characterized by a high ability to mutate 38 . The Custommune pipeline can be applied to other vaccine strategies by following a parallel workflow ( Figure 1 ). An example of these applications are acute infections, such as COVID-19. In this case, an approach combining neutralizing antibody responses and recognition by HLA haplotypes most represented in a given population might provide a reasonable compromise between specificity and scalability. To this aim, using Bepipred-2.0 39 , Custommune can identify potential neutralizing epitopes which overlap with epitopes consistent with recognition by population-specific Class II HLA haplotypes. At the same time, Custommune can predict another set of epitopes optimized for recognition by HLA Class I haplotypes of the same population, thus providing two levels of potential immune recognition. Overall, the Custommune pipeline provides a flexible and fast tool to generate epitope predictions according to the genetic diversity of the virus and the genetic HLA profile/s of the host or susceptible populations.",

In this trial, autologous dendritic cells were pulsed with a personalized vaccine designed manually from Gag sequences generated from each patient\u00b4s circulating virus. In the study groups (G5 and G6) that had received this vaccine (along with other interventions), the patients showed variable responses including two individuals who displayed significant control of viral load during ATI 32 . When viral and HLA sequences of patients from G5 and G6 were used as input for Custommune, the epitopes predicted by the tool generally displayed some overlap with those administered in the study ( Figure  2A) . Therefore, to investigate the potential therapeutic efficacy of Custommune predictions, we stratified patients based on the virologic response during ATI, which was defined as > 1 Log10 \u2206 viral load set point (i.e. the difference between median pre-and post-therapy copies of HIV-1 RNA/mL of plasma). Of note, non-responders were the only patients for whom there was no overlapping prediction between epitopes calculated by Custommune and those administered in vivo ( Figure 2B ). Conversely, patients who had been administered vaccine epitopes highly overlapping (>50%) with those predicted by Custommune, were characterized by higher viral load abatement ( Figure 2C ). These data suggest that Custommune can predict epitopes with therapeutic potential and could improve both efficacy and speed of personalized vaccine design.",

Due to the recent evolution of SARS-CoV-2, there is no equivalent of HIV-1 Gag, i.e. a validated viral target for effective immunity. However, SARS-CoV-2 shares approximately 80% sequence identity with SARS-CoV 41 , the causative agent of an epidemic burst of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in 2003. Therefore, we decided to use previously described strategies successfully targeting SARS-CoV replication as a template to restrict Custommune predictions. In particular, our efforts were directed at two validated sub-targets within the S-glycoprotein necessary for viral attachment to host cells 42 : 1) the portion of the S-glycoprotein that mediates the main protein-protein interaction with the cellular entry receptor, i.e. angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), as this was described as an optimal target for neutralizing antibodies 43 ; 2) the viral S-glycoprotein region binding the glycosylated portion of ACE2, an interaction inhibited by pretreatment with chloroquine 44, 45 , a drug recently shown to effectively hamper SARS-CoV-2 replication in vitro and in patients 46, 47 .",

Considering the configuration of ACE2, we superimposed complexes of S-glycoprotein/ACE2 in both states of the receptor, i.e. free or bound (in this case with the competitive inhibitor MLN-4760) 48 . Our analyses indicated that the receptor-binding domain (RBD) surface of S-glycoprotein interacting with the bound configuration of ACE2 is relatively smaller than (though 100% overlapping with) that interacting with the unbound configuration of ACE2 ( Figure  3A ,B). In light of this, we decided to restrict the Custommune input to the RBD sequence interacting with bound ACE2 and the linker amino acids (henceforth RBDp) ( Figure 3A ,B). It is expected that this approach will be able to evoke antibodies against the RBDp irrespective of the ACE2 bound/unbound configuration.",

The oligosaccharide moiety of ACE2 was described as fundamental for optimal binding of the S-glycoprotein of SARS-CoVs 44 . So far, in published structures, only partial ACE2-bound oligosaccharide data is available. Therefore, we decided to study this phenomenon by analyzing a published structure of inhibitor-bound ACE2 (1R4L), which presents an N-acetylglucosamine (NAG) covalently bound to residue Asn90 and remaining from the oligosaccharide originally attached to this protein 49 . This evidence suggests that the NAG present in the 1R4L structure is a marker of the position of the oligosaccharide originally attached to ACE2 before being altered by the crystallization process. By superimposing this structure to the structure of the S-glycoprotein with ACE2 and measuring the atomic distances at the binding interface between NAG and the S-glycoprotein, we were able to determine the specific segment of the S-glycoprotein RBD that could be responsible for the interaction with the ACE2-bound oligosaccharide. Two specific residues of the S-glycoprotein (Gly416 -Lys417) were found to interact with NAG, being within a 10 \u212b radius from NAG, i.e. a distance associated with significant intermolecular interactions ( Figure 3C ,D). Using S-glycoprotein Gly416 as a starting point, we selected a core peptide spanning 20 amino acids in both directions of the translation frame. This led to the identification of a segment of the S-glycoprotein RBD, which we henceforth name RBDg, as a bona fide target for vaccine epitope design ( Figure 4A ).",

This was done to ensure that a unique peptide may provide the double stimulus necessary for optimal B-cell activation and antibody production (Supplementary File 5). In line with the Custommune pipeline, and in order to improve the likelihood of immune recognition, the binding stability and affinity of the most promising epitopes was validated by molecular docking. In particular, epitopes were selected for docking if they had been predicted to bind with an IC50 < 600 nM 53 to HLA alleles described at four digit resolution for the population of interest in the Allele Frequency Net Database (Supplementary File 5 and Figure 4B ,C). Interestingly, the identified epitopes included key residues involved in hydrogen bond formation between the S-glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2 and ACE2 (e.g. Gln 474 in epitope STEIYQAGSTPCNGVEG, Gln498 in epitope LQSYGFQP and Lys417 in epitope IRGDEVRQIAPGQTGKIADYNYKLPD of S-glycoprotein, engaged, respectively, in hydrogen bonds with residues Gln24, Tyr41, Asp30 of ACE2). Since hydrogen bonds were recently described as crucial for the stability of the virus-receptor interaction 50 , epitopes containing the hydrogen-bonding residues might be particularly suitable targets to evoke immunity against structural determinants of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Moreover, in order to ensure the best coverage likelihood of the target population, we also included the predicted epitopes for the most prevalent Class I HLA antigens. Our results show that a peptide set specific for both neutralizing antibody/HLA Class II and for HLA Class I could provide a good population coverage upon simultaneous delivery, potentially achieving herd immunity (Fig 4C) . Of note, one of the most promising epitope candidates designed by Custommune for two of the populations examined (i.e. epitope KLPDDFTGC for Southern China/Wuhan and Northern Italy) (Supplementary File 5 and Figure 4C ) is equivalent to a highly immunogenic peptide previously identified by stimulating cells of patients who had successfully recovered from SARS infection 54 . Taken as a whole, these results show the application of Custommune to predict epitopes for specific populations and highlight a set of vaccine candidates to curb the spread of SARS-CoV-2 in highly affected areas.",

While cost considerations might represent a limiting factor in some settings, the quick advances in sequencing technology, coupled to the steep reduction in price 55 , make the approach already feasible in developed countries. Moreover, a personalized intervention aimed at a cure could make the cost-benefit analysis attractive also in developing countries, which often bear the main burden of chronic viral infections 56 . In terms of potential efficacy, the Custommune approach relies on minimizing epitope diversity while maximizing predicted binding strength and immunogenicity of said epitopes. It is noteworthy that, when compared to a real clinical scenario, epitopes predicted by Custommune correlated with treatment response. This was likely aided by the large amount of immunologic data available on HIV-1 (e.g. Los Alamos HIV immunology site). Therefore, due to its low cost and scalability, Custommune could be immediately applied to the design of therapeutic HIV peptide vaccines 57 or autologous dendritic cell vaccines pulsed with tailored Gag peptides. Compared to previous attempts at streamlining vaccine design in the context of cancer 58 , the Custommune pipeline includes multiple layers of epitope ranking with scoring parameters accounting for: mutational potential, structural conservation, HLA docking, escape mutations, location of the neomutation and previous evidence of antigenicity. These partially redundant filtration stages are envisaged to maximize the chances for durable and potent epitope recognition. Moreover, other filters such as predicted epitope processing and cleavage have been included to the pipeline when this manuscript was in preparation, confirming the versatility of the Custommune approach. Our implementation of Custommune was here extended to include vaccine design for SARS-CoV-2. Current predictions suggest that traditional vaccine strategies might be too slow to address the spread of the pandemic and mitigate the death toll 59 . Furthermore, immune responses developed during natural infection might be insufficient to provide long-term protection against reinfection 60 . The approach herein proposed is aimed at a flexible response customized for the populations most affected at a given time. As a novel pathogen will necessarily lack the wealth of immunologic data available for heavily studied viruses like HIV-1, our vaccine strategy attempts both induction of cell-mediated immunity and neutralizing antibodies. Indeed, early evidence indicates that a broad immune response might correlate with successful clearance of the infection 61 . Custommune predicted epitopes would further combine this broad immune stimulation with a design based on the most common HLA alleles in the population of interest, potentially providing enough immune coverage for the induction of herd immunity. Moreover, the choice of a highly conserved viral target as a source of vaccine epitopes should ensure a broadly effective response in those individuals for whom the vaccine should prove immunogenic. By utilizing Custommune, the whole vaccine design process should last less than a working day. Therefore, this approach, if successful, could be quickly adopted to blunt the pandemics during its spread or, ideally to preempt it. The binding affinities predicted by Custommune for epitopes derived from RBDp and RBDg were generally higher for HLA Class I alleles in the populations here considered. While this is not sufficient to predict that cell mediated immunity would be preferentially induced by the proposed vaccine, previous evidence in mice suggests that memory CD8 + T-cells might alone be sufficient .

Corroborating this hypothesis, one of the peptides designed by Custommune was equivalent to an epitope associated with clearance of SARS-CoV infection during the previous epidemics and with immunogenicity in mice when used as a vaccine 54 . Our estimate of the probability to reach herd immunity in the populations considered is based on the assumption that the development of immune responses against each of the vaccine peptides would be per se sufficient to guarantee some level of protection. While this prerequisite might prove optimistic, it is noteworthy that the viral targets selected for vaccine design (i.e. RBDp and RBDg of the S-glycoprotein) display exceptional evolutionary conservation and that no polymorphism in these regions was detected in the viral isolates from either Italy, South Korea or China. This conservation, coupled with the generally moderate mutation rate of SARS-CoV 63 and SARS-CoV-2 64 as compared to other RNA viruses, yields credibility to the idea of achieving protection by targeting single immunodominant epitopes 62 . Moreover, the expected population coverage of each of the vaccines designed in the present study is theoretically sufficient to achieve herd immunity based on the estimated reproductive number of SARS-CoV-2 34,65 . In the current work, to simplify administration schedule and increase scalability, we envisage, among other possibilities, a strategy synthesizing one multi-epitope peptide for each target population. This peptide would link Class II HLA-restricted and neutralizing antibody epitopes as well as Class I HLA-restricted CD8 + T-cell epitopes. However, this approach will require empirical validation and could be modified, e.g. by administering HLA Class I and Class II restricted epitopes in separate formulations. While reduced immunogenicity is a well-known caveat of epitope-based vaccines, recent advances in adjuvant and delivery technology might allow overcoming this limitation 66 . Apart from classical adjuvants, the use of an \"adjuvant\" drug such as chloroquine, is of particular interest for SARS-CoV-2. This treatment option could enhance vaccine immunogenicity 67,68 while possibly providing per se some protection against the virus 69 . In terms of delivery, carriers such as liposomes and nanoparticles, or strategies employing chemical conjugation or cell-penetrating peptides could increase epitope presentation by antigen presenting cells 66, 70 . Finally, in our current model, we envisaged the use of linker sequences with protease cleavage sites between different epitopes 71 . This strategy might increase the chances of presenting peptides of optimal size to both HLA alleles of Class I and Class II. However, covalent linkage of epitopes has also been described to increase immunogenicity 66 . In-vivo studies will be required to optimize these strategies for inducing immunity against SARS-CoV-2. Due to the ongoing rapid expansion of the epidemics and the relatively good safety profile of peptide vaccines 66 , pilot clinical testing in significantly affected areas might be envisaged. Overall, our study describes a novel tool to improve multi-epitope vaccine design specificity while drastically reducing the associated time and cost. The pipeline herein described can be directly applied for testing personalized therapeutic vaccines for HIV-1 and to identify the core epitopes of preventive vaccines aimed at populations heavily affected by SARS-CoV-2.",

The Pandas package (McKinney et al. 2010) is then used to structure epitope sorting tables and allow for comparative filtration. The primary filtration is based on IC50 values, a cutoff of 1000 nM is used to prevent loss of potentially false negatives. The Los Alamos HIV database (http://www.hiv.lanl.gov/content/immunology) was used to create internal HLA class-specific datasets of previously reported immunogenic epitopes against HIV Gag. Using Pandas 74 , high-affinity epitopes are compared to these datasets to highlight epitopes with previously described immunogenicity. Moreover, another filtration layer is designed to report escape variants by comparing each epitope to an internal database collected from various literature sources including: dataset of HLA-associated polymorphisms in HIV-1 Gag as reported in Ref. 75 , as well as the datasets reported in Ref. 76 and the datasets of CTL/CD8 + and T Helper/CD4 + epitope variants and escape mutations reported in the Los Alamos HIV database (http://www.hiv.lanl.gov/content/immunology/). Additional filtration is obtained by comparing the epitope location within the Gag sequence, to Gag regions essential for viral assembly and packaging, which tend to be structurally and evolutionarily conserved, as reported in Ref. 29 . To further refine this filtration, Custommune computes the degree of conservation for each epitope by comparing the epitope sequence to the HIV Sequence Compendium database 77 which includes 680 alignments of HIV-1/SIVcpz Gag protein sequences. The degree of conservation (Cscore) of each epitope is calculated as a fraction represented by the subset of sequences{ }in which the epitope scored a local alignment of more than 80% using Clustal Omega 36 over the total sequences in the internal database.",

This refined analysis is performed only on the top three ranking epitopes initially predicted by the tool. By computing affinities to the same allele the user can estimate the impact of mutations in this specific segment on the affinity to the restricted allele. The degree of deviation of the mutated version is estimated based on , which are calculated as a standard deviation (SD) of the set of IC50 values for the candidate epitope and its mutant versions.

Panel C) \u2206 viral load set point in trial participants who received peptides with high or low overlap to Custommune predictions (\u2265 50% or < 50% overlap, respectively). The \u2206 viral load set point was calculated as the difference between pre-and post-therapy viral load set points, with post-therapy viral load set point calculated as the median of all available measurements (up to 9 weeks post-treatment interruption). Each data point in panels B and C indicates a trial participant. Consensus sequence and evolutionary conservation were calculated based on the multiple sequence alignments in Supplementary Files 2 and 3 using Jalview 87 . The conservation score is based on 51 . (B) Example of epitope-HLA docking pose generated using LightDock 79 . The Custommune-predicted epitope \"KIADYNYKL\" (magenta) is shown restricted by the HLA class I histocompatibility antigen A-2 \u03b1-chain (HLA-A*02:01, green), which is highly expressed in Northern Italy (Supplementary File 4) . Also shown is the invariant \u03b22-microglobulin (cyan). The docking pose was scored using the DFIRE function 85 as listed in Supplementary file 5. (C) Custommune vaccine predictions and expected coverage for each target population. Predicted epitopes were selected from those on which docking was performed (Supplementary File 5). Maximum expected population coverage was calculated based on allele frequencies in each population (listed in Supplementary File 4) according to the formula described in the \"Materials and Methods\" section. Linker regions between vaccine peptides are an example of a vaccine strategy based on a single, multi-epitope, formulation.",
