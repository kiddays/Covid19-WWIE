The mode of infection of COVID-19 is thought to be direct entry of the SARS-CoV-2 virus into cells via the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor, which is expressed predominantly in the lungs but also throughout the cardiovascular system (1) . Thus, while the most virulent manifestation of COVID-19 is acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), select reports from Europe and China have also demonstrated cardiac injury reflected through elevated troponin concentrations among infected patients (2) (3) (4) (5) . In these limited case series, troponin elevation was more common in patients with preexisting cardiovascular disease and, when present, was associated with higher rates of adverse outcomes in patients hospitalized with COVID-19 (6) .",

Patients were considered to be right-censored if they were (1) discharged from the hospital alive or (2) remained in the hospital at the time of data freeze (April 12th). We fit Cox proportional hazards regression models with mortality as the dependent variable, adjusting for age, sex, race, ethnicity, history of CAD, history of AF, history of HF, history of HTN, history of CKD, history of DM, and in-hospital intubation. Age was modeled as age at time of admission, while gender and history of CAD, AF, HTN, CKD, DM, and in-hospital intubation were modeled with binary variables. Self-declared race was included in the model stratified in indicator variables corresponding to Caucasian, African American, Asian, Pacific Islander, Other, or Unknown with Caucasian as reference. Self-declared ethnicity was included in models as Hispanic/Latino, Non-Hispanic/Latino, and Unknown with Hispanic/Latino as the reference level. We tested for proportional hazards assumption by plotting Martingale residuals from the Cox proportional hazards model vs. linearized predictions. 95% confidence intervals from a LOESS best-fit line fit to the Martingale residuals included 0 for all values of the linear predictions, indicating visually there was not significant violation of the proportional hazards assumption. We then plotted Kaplan-Meier curves for survival stratified by troponin group. All analyses were conducted in R version 3.6.1, and visualizations were produced using the survminer R package (7, 8) .",

Consequently, in assessing causal connections between COVID-19 and cardiac injury, it is critical to apply concepts described in the Fourth Universal Definition of Myocardial Infarction. In this regard, very few patients meet strict criteria for acute myocardial infarction; though some patients in this cohort certainly suffered ischemic myocardial damage from either Type 1 or 2 myocardial infarction, it is more likely the injury observed was mediated through a All rights reserved.

Patients with cardiovascular disease had comorbidities of coronary artery disease, heart failure, or atrial fibrillation. Patients with cardiovascular risk factors had comorbidities of DM or HTN, but not cardiovascular disease Central Figure. Myocardial injury reflected by troponin concentrations above the upper reference limit (URL) of 0.03ng/mL was present in 36 percent of patients hospitalized with COVID-19. Troponin levels among patients hospitalized with COVID-19 were generally under 1.0 ng/mL. Patients with a history of cardiovascular disease (in red, bottom left panel) including coronary artery disease, atrial fibrillation, and heart failure had higher troponin concentrations than patients without cardiovascular disease. Even small amounts of myocardial injury (e.g. troponin I 0.03-0.09ng/mL, n=455, 16.6%) were associated with death (adjusted HR: 1.77, 95% CI 1.39-2.26; P<0.001) while greater amounts (e.g. troponin I>0.09 ng/dL, n=530, 19.4%) were associated with more pronounced risk (adjusted HR 3.23, 95% CI 2.59-4.02). Troponin elevation in the setting of acute COVID-19 likely reflects non-ischemic or secondary myocardial injury.

This risk was consistent across patients stratified by history of CVD, CVD risk factors such as DM or HTN only, and neither CVD nor risk factors.(Figure 4b).

Other postulated mechanisms by which COVID-19 leads to cardiovascular morbidity include direct myocardial injury as a result of the inflammatory cascade or cytokine release, microvascular damage due to disseminated intravascular coagulation and thrombosis, direct entry of SARS-CoV-2 into myocardial cells by binding to ACE2 receptors, hypoxemia combined with increased metabolic demands of acute illness leading to myocardial injury akin to Type 2 Myocardial Infarction, and finally acute coronary syndrome from acute inflammation-triggered destabilization of atheromas (18-20). In a recent case series of 18 patients with COVID-19 infection and ST-segment elevation on electrocardiogram, 10 were deemed to have non-coronary myocardial injury by virtue of nonobstructive disease on coronary angiography and/or normal wall motion on echocardiography",
