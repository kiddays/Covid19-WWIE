It is apparent that culture does not constitute the main factor influencing the exponential rate. Figure 2 shows the regional variation of infected cases (left) and average winter temperature (right) in Italy. The possible negative correlation, observed between regional number of infected cases and winter temperature in Italy, is an indication of the influence of temperature on the exponential growth, but it certainly does not constitute a necessary condition. The reason is that the map plots the total number of the infected cases N t , which does not depend only on the exponential rate \u03bb, but also on the initial number of cases N 0 .",

Therefore, there is a non-negligible possibility, the observed regional variation of the number of infected cases N t to be caused by the regional distribution of the initial cases N 0 . In such a case, main airport cities would have incredibly high number of infected cases outplaying a possible negative correlation of daily infected cases with regional average temperature T; the latter may be one of the reasons of the high numbers of cases observed in New York City and Rome. On the other hand, in their letter to the White House, members of a National Academy of Sciences committee said that \"There is some evidence to suggest that [coronavirus] may transmit less efficiently in environments with higher ambient temperature and humidity; however, given the lack of host immunity globally, this reduction in transmission efficiency may not lead to a significant reduction in disease spread without the concomitant adoption of major public health interventions\" (Relman, 2020) .",

For instance, several authors (e.g., Pawar et al., 2020; Yao et al., 2020) found insignificant correlations between temperatures and confirmed cases. However, their analysis was performed on the number of the infected cases N t , which is subject to the randomness of the initial cases N 0 as explained above, and not to the exponential growth rate \u03bb, which is dependent on physical characteristics of the coronavirus, binding protein, and environment. Analysis of regional cases can show whether the speculated negative correlation between temperature and number of infected cases is true, meaning a negative correlation between temperature and exponential growth rate. If the environmental temperature plays indeed a substantial role on the virus spread, then, this can provide promising results, such as, the estimation of the critical temperature that may eliminate the number of daily new cases in heavily infected regions.",

While these factors are not affecting the exponential growth rate \u03bb, they become more effective as the number of cases increases, getting closer to N max ; exponent b controls the effectiveness of these factors; strict {loose} measures correspond to smaller {larger} values of b. Figure 3 shows the evolution curve of the number of new (\u0394N t = N t+1 \u2212N t ) and total infected cases (N t ) and how this curve flattens for stricter measures (smaller values of b). As observed in Fig.3(b) , stricter measures, nicely modeled by decreasing b, do not affect the exponential rate \u03bb but they successfully flatten the curve. However, the same can be achieved by downgrading the exponential growth rate. It is apparent, then, how much useful would it be to know the factors that can flatten the curve by decreasing directly the exponential rate. Applied measures could be loosen and shorter! Model (1) originates from the logistic map family (e.g., Livadiotis, 2005; and references therein; Wu et al. 2020) ; other complicate versions, such as, the Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered models (e.g., Ciarochi, 2020) may be expressed by multi-dimensional differential or difference equations (e.g., Elaydi, 2005, and references therein; Livadiotis et al. 2016 ), but still, the curve flattening is governed by the same features. The two composites, the exponential growth E and the negative feedback I, are just the main and necessary conditions for reproducing the growth-decay phases of the spread curve. Their interplay shows how the spread curve can be flattened as a result of stricter measures, independently of the existent exponential rate.",

Therefore, as long as the exponential growth takes place, the environmental temperature has an effective role on the chemical reaction between virus and spike protein. Due to the negative activation energy, decreasing the environmental temperature reduces the probability of virus-protein reaction, thus the virus may stay inactive on air or surfaces and eventually die.

For this, we derive the temperature-rate relationship and its statistical confidence by fitting the homogenized set of sample points, instead of the raw sample points; then, we examine whether the fitting parameters differ from those derived from fitting the raw sample points. We homogenize the sample points by grouping them in temperature binning of \u0394T ~ 1 C 0 (e.g., see: Livadiotis & Desai 2016). We estimate the weighted mean and error of the rates included in each bin. In the case of US regions we also performed a homogenization of rates, by grouping the temperaturebinned means in rate binning of \u0394\u03bb ~ 0.01 d -1 . In the case of sample points with inverse temperatures, (T i -1 \u00b1\u03b4T i -1 , \u03bb i \u00b1\u03b4\u03bb i ), the procedure is exactly the same. Homogenized datasets result in a smooth relationship between the values of binned temperature and rate, as it can be observed in the plots of rate against temperature or inverse temperature (left or right lower panels, respectively), and for both US and Italy regions (Figs. 5 and 6, respectively) . The results are highly supportive of the negative correlation between rate and temperature. The results are shown in Table 4 . We observe that the linear relationships of the growth rate with temperature or inverse temperature are characterized by high statistical confidence for the homogenized datasets (p-values much higher than significant limit of 0.05; 2 red \uf063 far from the significant limits of 0.1 and 10). Therefore, the arrangement of sample points do not affect significantly the fitting results.",

This was found to be T C~8 6.1 \u00b1 4.3 F 0 for US regions. It is straightforward to ask when the environmental temperature will climb above this critical value. As an example, Figure 10 plots the daily average temperatures in San Antonio, Texas, shown that will be clearly above the estimated T C threshold in the second half of May. Figure 10 . According to the statistically confident relationship between exponential growth rate of infected cases shown in Fig.8 , the critical temperature, which eliminates the exponential growth, and thus the COVID-19 spread, is T C = 86.1 \u00b1 4.3 F 0 . The plot shows also the May-June daily, nightly, and 24h-averaged environmental temperatures in San Antonio, Texas, averaged over the last three years. The daily average temperatures will be clearly above the estimated T C threshold in the second half of May; thus, the plot suggests a possible date for loosening the strict measures in San Antonio, that is, May 24.",

The likelihood of having a 2 \uf063 value, equal to or larger than the estimated value 2 min \uf063 , is given by the complementary cumulative distribution. The probability of taking a result 2 \uf063 , larger than the estimated value 2 min \uf063 , defines the p-The larger the p-value, the better the fitting. According to this method, the probability of taking a result with 2 \uf063 being extremer than the observed value 2 min \uf063 , defines the p-value of the extremes; this equals the minimum between the two probabilities, . Fits associated with p-values smaller than the significance level of 0.05 are typically rejected. -Combined P-value and Chi-Square: The p-value of the extremes has very similar behavior with the reduced chi-square (Livadiotis, 2014), because, (i) the p-value attains the optimal value (p=0.5) when chi-square does ( 2 red \uf063 =1), (ii) larger values of 1-2p corresponds to larger values",
