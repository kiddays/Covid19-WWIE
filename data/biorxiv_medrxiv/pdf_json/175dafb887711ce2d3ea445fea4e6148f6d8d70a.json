Abstract Global spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has created an unprecedented infectious disease crisis worldwide. Despite uncertainties about COVID-19, model-based forecasting of competing mitigation measures on its course is urgently needed to inform mitigation policy. We used a stochastic agent-based microsimulation model of the COVID-19 epidemic in New York City and evaluated the potential impact of quarantine duration (from 4 to 16 weeks), quarantine lifting type (1-step lifting for all individuals versus a 2-step lifting according to age), post-quarantine screening, and use of a hypothetical effective treatment against COVID-19 on the disease's cumulative incidence and mortality, and on ICU-bed occupancy. The source code of the model has been deposited in a public source code repository (GitHub\u00ae). The model calibrated well and variation of model parameter values had little impact",

We projected that lifting quarantine in a single step for the full population would be unlikely to substantially lower the cumulative mortality, regardless of quarantine duration. By contrast, a two-step quarantine lifting according to age was associated with a substantially lower cumulative mortality and incidence, up to 71% and 23%, respectively, as well as lower ICU-bed occupancy. Although post-quarantine screening was associated with diminished epidemic rebound, this strategy may not prevent ICUs from being overcrowded. It may even become deleterious after a 2-step quarantine lifting according to age if the herd immunity effect does not had sufficient time to become established in the younger population when the quarantine is lifted for the older population. An effective treatment against COVID-19 would considerably reduce the consequences of the epidemic, even more so if ICU capacity is not exceeded.",

In this context, modelbased predictions of the impact of different mitigation strategies can help policy makers make the right decisions in a timely way, based on the main objectives of mitigation. These objectives include minimizing mortality and morbidity, avoiding an epidemic peak to reduce the strain on healthcare services, flattening the epidemic curve to wait for antibody-based test for COVID- 19 , antiviral drug therapies and vaccine development, and mitigating the economic impact of the pandemic (2) . Such policy objectives may require different, sometimes competing measures (3) . Furthermore, the effect of mitigation strategies are likely to substantially differ by population characteristics, e.g., the proportions of elderly persons and people with chronic diseases who are at increased risk of severe infection (4), healthcare system characteristics, e.g., intense care unit (ICU) bed availability, the stage of the epidemic, e.g., the number of people infected and immunized, the degree of population adherence to mitigation measures, the availability of human, economic and industrial resources, and possibly seasonality (5) .",

To face the epidemic, New York City has recently ordered all nonessential retailers and services to close or to keep all their workers home. New Yorkers are expected to largely stay home and wear a face covering when outside of home, and those who have symptoms or have tested positive for COVID- 19 have been ordered to stay in quarantine. Many NYC hospitals are already overwhelmed while the epidemic is progressing in other regions of the United States. Although these measures are likely to slow down the viral spread and reduce substantially peak healthcare demand and deaths in the short term as shown by Ferguson et al. in their influential microsimulation study (7, 8) , the epidemic is predicted to rebound once these measures will be relaxed (4, 7, 8) . Therefore, projecting the impact of different possible mitigation measures that could be implemented at this stage, including quarantine extension, quarantine lifting for everyone or certain groups of people, post-quarantine screening and potential treatment progress on the medical outcomes of the epidemic is urgently needed (2, 9) .",

Studies from China (26) and Italy (41) suggest a high number of undiagnosed infections, ranging from 80% to 92% of all infections. Similarly, a study from France suggests that about 4 million people (representing about 6.0% of the French general population) were infected by the end of March 2020, contrasting with the 44,000 confirmed cases, suggesting a 1 in 100 diagnosis rate (42) . It was assumed that individuals with no or light symptoms (i.e., isolated minor symptoms of COVID-19 such as stomach aches, body aches, or nausea) were not diagnosed, except if they were traceable contacts (i.e., intrafamilial, work, school) of diagnosed patients, and that all individuals with mild, severe, or critical symptoms were diagnosed. To reflect these assumptions, among infected individuals, the probability of being asymptomatic or lightly symptomatic in the model was set at 100% in children aged less than 10 years, since very few children have been diagnosed with COVID-19 (39) ; and was assumed to decrease linearly with age. The slope of this decrease was calibrated to show a cumulative incidence (diagnosed + undiagnosed) of 1 in 100 diagnosis rate.",

A prior review (47) suggested that the median of the basic reproduction number (R0) of COVID-19 would be 2.79. This variable was included as an outcome in our model to examine whether the predicted value was in line with published reports, and thus evaluate the potential predictive value of the model. It was assumed that individuals with no symptoms or light symptoms had only a 10% risk of infecting other individuals to account for a probable lower viral load in these individuals. The risk of transmission was highest at the onset of the symptoms. To take into account the risk of transmission before developing symptoms (17) , it was assumed that infected individuals were contagious starting one day after infection, albeit with a contagiousness that decreases exponentially the further away from onset. An exponential function was chosen because it fitted well with the dynamics of viral replication, based on these assumptions. Individuals who recovered were considered as having acquired immunity against the virus and no longer at risk of infection. Based on prior work (48) , sensitivity of reverse transcription polymerase chain reactions (RT-PCR) to detect COVID-19 cases was assumed to be 71%.",

The variation of each model parameter value by \u00b120% had limited impact on outcome estimates (i.e., less than 4,000 per 100,000 for incidence and 11 per 100,000 for mortality), suggesting the robustness of our results. We projected that quarantine, while efficient to contain the viral spread, is unable to prevent a rebound of the epidemic once lifted, resulting in a similar, albeit delayed, overwhelming of ICUs. Based on our model, a 2-step quarantine lifting according to age, i.e., a 3-week quarantine period for younger individuals and an additional 8-week quarantine period for older people, would be associated with better outcomes, including a lower cumulative incidence, mortality and number of ICU beds needed, than a 16-week quarantine followed by a lifting for all individuals. An age cut-off of 60 years instead of 70 years did not substantially modify the mortality and incidence, but was associated with a reduced number of ICU beds needed. Although post-quarantine screening of all symptomatic individuals could bring some benefits after a quarantine lifting for all individuals, we found that this strategy may be ineffective after a 2-step quarantine lifting according to age, and potentially deleterious if herd immunity effect does not had sufficient time to be established in the younger population when the quarantine is lifted for the older population. Finally, an effective treatment against COVID-19 would considerably improve the consequences of the epidemic, even more so if ICU capacity is not exceeded. All rights reserved.

Furthermore, this strategy may potentially attenuate the severe economic and social consequences that a prolonged quarantine of the full population, including workers, would cause. As previously suggested (51), these results could be explained by the herd immunity effect, i.e., the reduction of the infection as a result of the indirect protection observed in the unimmunized segment of the population in which a large proportion has been infected and therefore immunized (51), as reflected by the predicted flattening of the cumulative incidence curve around 77% of the population with this strategy. Indeed, once the quarantine is lifted for younger healthy individuals in whom the risk of developing severe or critical symptoms or dying from SARS-CoV-2 is the lowest (4), most of them would inevitably -in the absence of a vaccine -become infected and immunized, and could be adequately treated since ICUs are not expected to be overwhelmed, even during the peak incidence. Once most of them are immunized against COVID-19, the herd immunity effect is likely to prevent older adults from becoming infected when the quarantine would be secondarily lifted for them, i.e., 8 weeks later in our scenario.

Specifically, in this scenario using a 70-year of age cut-off, this strategy would result in an 18% increase in mortality, probably because it delays the herd immunity effect in the younger population, leading a greater proportion of vulnerable older adults to be exposed to COVID-19. An extension of the quarantine period for the older people until the younger population is largely immunized would probably diminish this increased mortality. These findings may be explained by the assumption in the model and supported by prior studies (41, 52) that asymptomatic undiagnosed patients are responsible for a large hidden epidemic that exacerbates as soon as the confinement ends. Even when a much lower transmission rate was considered in the model for asymptomatic individuals, we found that disease progression persisted. However, the efficacy of this strategy is highly dependent on the assumption of the true diagnosis rate, which will be better estimated once results of large-scale studies using antibody-based tests for COVID-19 become available.",

Nevertheless, the observed differences across scenarios remained unchanged overall when considering a much higher and unlikely (26, 41, 42) diagnosis rate of 1 in 10, except for the efficacy of the post-quarantine screening on the course of the epidemic, which was much greater under this assumption, contributing to the robustness of our conclusions. Second, the contact matrix was approximated using multiple assumptions for each type of contact. However, we found that the model calibrated well, suggesting that although the assumptions made for unknown parameters, such as the frequency of meeting friends or the number of people met during shopping, can be criticized, the overall model, for which most parameter values were based on prior findings (eTable 1), may adequately predict the course of the COVID-19 epidemic in NYC. Third, we considered that infected people could develop immunity for at least several months following standard assumptions (53) . However, post-COVID-19 immunity length remains unknown (54) . Fourth, although the main differences observed were substantial and remained similar to a \u00b120% variation of each model parameter value, suggesting the generalizability of our results to other locales, future studies using this model and adjusting it to other city's characteristics would be useful to verify this assumption.",
