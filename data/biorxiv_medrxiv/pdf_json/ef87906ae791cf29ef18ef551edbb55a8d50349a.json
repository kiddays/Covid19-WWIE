As this article was being prepared, the spreading mechanism of the novel coronavirus disease now designated as COVID-19 had yet to be identified, but according to the American Centers for Disease Control, its spreading mechanism and patterns are likely more similar to influenza than to other coronaviruses such as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS-CoV-1) or Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV). To consider potential COVID-19 spatial patterns, we applied EpiRank to the 2003 SARS outbreak in north Taiwan for comparison with H1N1 and EV. SARS was found to be less contagious than H1N1 or EV, but with a significantly higher fatality rate. The characteristics of these diseases determined their specific spatial spreading patterns, as reflected in the different effects of forward and backward commuting movement. Our motivation is to highlight these differences and to illustrate EpiRank spatial patterns for the 2003 SARS outbreak for comparison with EpiRank-determined distributions for the H1N1 and EV outbreaks. Our results indicate that the daytime parameter (i.e., forward movement effect) range was slightly higher (0.5-0.55) for the SARS outbreak than for either the influenza (0.4-0.5) or EV (0.3-0.5) outbreaks, suggesting that the forward-and-backward movements of individuals between residential and core urban areas with concentrated populations were equally important regarding the spread of SARS. While COVID-19 might resemble either SARS or H1N1 in terms of spatial spreading, its daytime parameter is likely somewhere in-between, with backward movement being dominant (similar to H1N1) or with forward and backward movement being equally important (similar to SARS). Building on Huang et al.'s paper, we present an estimated risk distribution pattern for the Taipei Metropolitan Area for a daytime parameter of 0.55.",

However, in mid-February 2020 the COVID-19 spreading mechanism and spatial epidemiology were both believed to be more similar to influenza and other respiratory infections in terms of primary transmission method-respiratory droplets 3 . Infected patients can be asymptomatic or express a broad range (mild to severe) of COVID-19 symptoms 4 . Similar to influenza, COVID-19 carriers can transmit the disease whether or not they show symptoms-a characteristic of special concern to epidemiologists, public health specialists, and government officials 5, 6 .

EpiRank integrates the effects of transmission via the forward and backward movements of commuters. Its primary assumption is that initial carriers move the virus from homes to workplaces (forward), infect other commuters using public transportation as well as coworkers and susceptible individuals during their daily activities, and then infect others during the return commute and family members in their homes. EpiRank calculations use a \"daytime parameter\" to capture the effect of forward and backward movement, and a \"damping factor\" to capture diffusion proportions according to commuting network characteristics rather than random transmission. Their study focused on the 2009 H1N1 (Influenza A) outbreak and the spatial distribution of the 2000-2008 type 71 enterovirus (EV), both in Taiwan. Their results revealed optimum daytime values between 0.3 (Pearson's R) and 0.5 (Spearman's rho) for flu cases and between 0.4 (Pearson's R) and 0.5 (Spearman's rho) for EV cases. Daytime values below 0.5 were viewed as evidence of a stronger backward movement effect on the spreading of flu and EV cases.",

As in Huang et al.'s experiments 1 , we only considered a uniform probability distribution for the external factor-that is, all nodes had the same probability of coming into contact with a contagious individual. Accordingly, a damping factor of 1 means that disease transmission was more dependent on network structure than a uniform distribution. A daytime parameter approaching 0.55 indicates that the effects of both forward and backward movements were essentially equal in terms of disease diffusion, with forward movement only slightly more important. .

Possible explanations for the higher SARS daytime parameter (>0.5) that we observed in the present study include a higher fatality rate, smaller number of patients, effects of public health policies, and a slightly lower basic reproduction number (R 0 ). In Taiwan, SARS had a much higher fatality rate than flu (13% 9 versus 0.001% 10 ), and therefore attracted greater media and research attention over a shorter time period. The fatality rate triggered a rapid government response in the form of several policy decisions involving large amounts of resources aimed at controlling the disease. These policies resulted in a much lower overall number of SARS patients compared to flu patients. R 0 , defined as the expected number of cases caused by a single infected patient, is used to describe the spreading capabilities of diseases. The R 0 values associated with the H1N1 virus in Taiwan were 1.16 during the first phase and 1.87 during the second 11 ; the SARS R 0 was measured as 1.54 12 -in other words, the 2009 H1N1 influenza strain was more contagious than SARS. Patients infected with H1N1 could carry disease pathogens with few or no discernable symptoms, increasing the potential to infect susceptible individuals-especially coworkers and family members. However, when they showed signs of the disease, they were more likely to stay at home and treat themselves. During the SARS outbreak, individuals who exhibited even the faintest symptoms were immediately sent to hospitals for treatment, which mitigated the spreading potential. This difference explains, at least in part, why the backward movement was more important for influenza than for SARS.",
