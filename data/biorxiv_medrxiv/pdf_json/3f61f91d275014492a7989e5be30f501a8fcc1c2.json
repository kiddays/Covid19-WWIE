Running head: SARS-CoV-2 vaccination impact. Abstract Background: Several SARS-CoV-2 vaccine candidates are currently in the pipeline. This study aims to inform SARS-CoV-2 vaccine development, licensure, decision-making, and implementation by determining key preferred vaccine product characteristics and associated population-level impact. Methods: Vaccination impact was assessed at various efficacies using an age-structured mathematical model describing SARS-CoV-2 transmission and disease progression, with application for China. Results: A prophylactic vaccine with efficacy against acquisition ( S VE ) of \u226570% is needed to eliminate this infection. A vaccine with S VE <70% will still have a major impact, and may control the infection if it reduces infectiousness or infection duration among those vaccinated who acquire the infection, or alternatively if supplemented with a moderate social-distancing intervention (<20% reduction in contact rate), or complemented with herd immunity. Vaccination is cost-effective. For a vaccine with S VE of 50%, number of vaccinations needed to avert one infection is only 2.4, one severe disease case is 25.5, one critical disease case is 33.2, and one death is 65.1. Gains in effectiveness are achieved by initially prioritizing those \u226560 years. Probability of a major outbreak is virtually zero with a vaccine with S VE \u226570%, regardless of number of virus introductions. Yet, an increase in social contact rate among those vaccinated (behavior compensation) can undermine vaccine impact.",

            "text": "In absence of a vaccine, even if partially efficacious [6] , containment of the epidemic in China necessitated large-scale contact tracing and testing through deployment of thousands of healthcare fieldworkers along with severe quarantine measures [4] . The strain put on healthcare systems [7] , and the global human [8, 9] and economic [10] losses caused by the virus and resulting disease, designated as Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-2019) [11] , accelerated efforts towards vaccine development [6, 12] . While multiple vaccine candidates are currently in the pipeline, they are still in early stage of development [6, 12, 13] . Assessment of the population-level impact of vaccine candidates through mathematical modeling is a critical component of the process of vaccine development, value proposition, licensure, decision-making, and pathways and costs of vaccine administration, and has been utilized for a wide range of infectious diseases [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] . In early stages of development, modeling is used to define the vaccine's key preferred product characteristics, by estimating levels of efficacy necessary to observe significant population-level impact, determining necessary duration of protection/immunity incurred by the vaccine, and identifying priority populations for optimal effectiveness [21, 29, 30]. These parameters provide early guidance to developers, manufacturers, regulators, and decision makers about candidates that are likely to be optimal through specifying vaccine characteristics that will maximize public health impact and cost-effectiveness [21, 28, 29, 31, 32] . Once key attributes are established, modeling plays an integral role in building the case for investment in vaccine development, and in ensuring rapid roll-out post-licensing, through assessment of risks, costs, and predicted returns associated with different immunization strategies [29, 33] . Post-vaccination, modeling is used to inform design and interpretation of surveillance studies [25] [26] [27] .",

This scenario is relevant for assessing impact of vaccination on future SARS-CoV-2 introductions in countries where the epidemic has been contained or at low level, such as in China.

Of note that there are minor differences in effectiveness over time. For instance, in initial phases of the epidemic, prioritizing those 60-69 years of age was slightly more effective than prioritizing those 40-49 years of age ( Figure S8 of SM). Meanwhile, towards end of epidemic cycle, the inverse was true. Figure 5B illustrates the gains in effectiveness as While a vaccine with 50% S VE = cannot fully control the epidemic, Figure S9 of SM shows the impact when vaccination is supplemented with a social-distancing intervention that reduces the contact rate. Less than 20% reduction in contact rate would be sufficient to fully control the epidemic.",

Vaccine impact and costeffectiveness will not only depend on its efficacy in preventing infection, but can be enhanced if those vaccinated who still acquire the infection have reduced infectiousness, duration of infection, and disease severity. Vaccine developers should thus not only assess the primary endpoint of reduction in acquisition, but also other outcomes and/or proxy biomarkers including reductions in viral load and disease outcomes and speed of infection clearance for those vaccinated and unvaccinated.

Vaccine effectiveness of age-group prioritization and the reproduction number R0. Model predictions for SARS CoV-2 attack rate at various levels of R0, indicating also the impact on R0 of prioritizing those 60-69 years of age for vaccination or vaccinating all age groups. The blue dashed-dotted line shows the modelpredicted attack rate at various levels of R0. The blue, red, and green stars show, respectively, the model-predicted attack rates in absence of vaccination, by prioritizing vaccination at 80% coverage for those 60-69 years of age, and by extending vaccination at 80% coverage to all age groups. The figure highlights how effectiveness of the vaccine (number of vaccinations needed to avert one infection) depends on the position on the R0 curve-prioritizing vaccination for any single age group, regardless of that age group, has overall lower effectiveness than extending vaccination to all age groups. The reason is that vaccinating one age group reduces R0 only marginally, whereas vaccinating all age groups reduces R0 to an epidemic domain where small reductions in R0 can have more substantial impact on epidemic size.

Results for the lower bound are in Figure S10 of SM and derivations in Section D of SM. Uncertainty analysis demonstrated robustness of model predictions to a wide range of uncertainty in input parameters (Figure S11 of SM). Discussion Above results indicate that even a partially-efficacious vaccine can offer a fundamental solution to the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic-the vaccine does not need to have sterilizing immunity to fully control the infection. Indeed, a vaccine with S VE \u226570% could be sufficient to control the pandemic at \u226580% coverage (Figure 5A). Even a vaccine with S VE <70% may still control the infection if it additionally (and plausibly) induces \"breakthrough\" effects such as reduction in viral load (reduction in infectiousness; I VE ) or faster infection clearance (reduction in infection duration; 1 P VE ) among those vaccinated who still acquire the infection. The latter effects have individually (that is in absence of protection against acquisition) a comparable impact on transmission to that of a prophylactic vaccine that reduces infection acquisition (Figures 1 and 2). Even in absence of such effects, infection control can still be achieved if vaccination is supplemented with only a moderate social-distancing intervention (Figure S9 of SM), or complemented with partial herd immunity-a considerable fraction of the population could have acquired the infection and developed protective antibodies by the time of vaccine roll-out. Even a vaccine that does not prevent infection yet only mitigates disease progression (reduction in All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission.",

Early introduction optimally defers epidemic growth, flattens the incidence curve, and reduces number of infections and disease outcomes (Figures 1 and 2 and Figures S2-S5 of SM). The vaccine will likely be cost-effective over a broad range of efficacy levels (Figure 5B). For a vaccine with S VE of 50%, number of vaccinations needed to avert one infection is only 2.4, one severe disease case is 25.5, one critical disease case is 33.2, and one death is 65.1 (Figure 3).

Roll-out of a vaccine with intermediate efficacy should be coupled with public health communication that stresses caution in social mixing following vaccination. This study has limitations. Model estimations are contingent on validity and generalizability of input data. While we used available evidence for SARS-CoV-2 natural history and epidemiology, our understanding of the epidemiology is still evolving. We assessed vaccine impact using China as an illustrative example, given the advanced epidemic cycle, yet evidence suggests that many infections may have been undocumented in this country, particularly in the early epidemic phase [46]. This may affect some estimates, such as mortality, probably towards overestimation [34, 47]. While the absolute impact of the vaccine on disease severity and mortality may have been overestimated, the relative impact (reduction rate) is less likely to have been affected. Our baseline 0 R for China was 2.1 [34], but 0 R may vary across settings, thus affecting estimates for the minimum efficacy needed for infection elimination. For instance, for an 0 R of 3, the minimum S VE needed for elimination is about 90% (Figure S12 of SM).
