            "text": "Detection of SARS-CoV-2 infections to date has relied on RT-PCR testing. However, a failure to identify early cases imported to a country, bottlenecks in RT-PCR testing, and the existence of infections which are asymptomatic, sub-clinical, or with an alternative presenta-15 tion than the standard cough and fever have resulted in an under-counting of the true prevalence of SARS-CoV-2. Here, we show how publicly available CDC influenza-like illness (ILI) outpatient surveillance data can be repurposed to estimate the detection rate of symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections. We find a surge of non-influenza ILI above the seasonal average and show that this surge is correlated with COVID case counts across states. By quantifying the 20 number of excess ILI patients in March relative to previous years and comparing excess ILI to confirmed COVID case counts, we estimate the syndromic case detection rate of SARS-CoV-2 in the US to be less than 13%. If only 1/3 of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 sought care, the ILI surge would correspond to more than 8.7 million new SARS-CoV-2 infections across the US during the three week period from March 8 to March 28. Combining excess ILI 25 counts with the date of onset of community transmission in the US, we also show that the early epidemic in the US was unlikely to be doubling slower than every 4 days. Together these results suggest a conceptual model for the COVID epidemic in the US in which rapid spread across the US are combined with a large population of infected patients with presumably mild-to-moderate clinical symptoms. We emphasize the importance of testing these findings 30 with seroprevalence data, and discuss the broader potential to use syndromic time series for early detection and understanding of emerging infectious diseases.",

This surge of excess 50 ILI correlates with known patterns of SARS-CoV-2 spread across states within the US, suggesting the surge is unlikely to be due to other endemic respiratory pathogens, yet is orders of magnitude larger than the number of confirmed COVID cases reported. Together this suggests that the true prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 within the US is much larger than currently appreciated and that the syndromic case detection rate is likely less than 13%, corresponding to more than 2.8 million new 55 ILI cases due to SARS-CoV-2 and, assuming influenza-like clinical rates, more than 8.7 million total SARS-CoV-2 cases. Our analysis provides empirical corroboration of previous hypotheses of substantial undocumented cases yet places the estimated undocumented case rate higher than prior reports [6] . The SARS-CoV-2 prevalence estimates obtained from the ILI surge are consistent with an epidemic doubling time of less than 4 days. A sub-4 day doubling time is substantially faster 60 than many prior reports [7, 8] yet is consistent with the 3-day doubling time of observed deaths due to COVID within the US. Our findings support a conceptual model for COVID spread in the US in which more rapid spread than previously reported is coupled with a larger undiagnosed population to give rise to currently observed trends. Finally, we find that the ILI surge peaks the week starting March 15, and we discuss the potential explanations for this phenomenon.",

Many states, including Washington, New York, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Maryland, Colorado, New Jersey, and Louisiana, have had a recent surge 70 in number of non-influenza ILI cases far in excess of seasonal norms. For example, in the second week of March, 2020, Oregon saw 50% higher non-influenza ILI than it had ever seen since the inception of the ILINet surveillance system within the US. We find that with 95% probability, approximately 4% of all outpatient visits in Oregon during this time were for ILI that could not be explained by either influenza or the normal seasonal variation of respiratory pathogens. We find 75 that as the seasonal surge of endemic non-influenza respiratory pathogens declines, this excess ILI correlates more strongly with state-level patterns of newly confirmed COVID cases suggesting that this surge is a reflection of ILI due to SARS-CoV-2 (Pearson \u03c1 > 0.35 and p < 0.05 for the last three weeks; Figure S1A ). Notably, we find that the ILI surge appears to peak during the week starting on March 15 and subsequently decreases in numerous states the following week; notable 80 exceptions are New York and New Jersey, two of the states that have been the hardest hit by the epidemic, which have not started a decline by the week ending March 28.",

If the ILI surge reflected higher rates of detection 85 of typically mild ILI, we would expect emergency department ILI rates would increase yet the proportion of those ILI cases admitted to the hospital would decrease. We were able to obtain data to evaluate this hypothesis from New York City's influenza surveillance network [9] . In the month of March, the daily number of ILI visits to emergency departments across New York City increased while the proportion of those who went on to be admitted also increased by as much as 90 3-fold compared to the baseline rate prior to March ( Figure S1 ). This suggests that patients are presenting less often for mild ILI, and such decrease in care-seeking behavior, if similar across the US, could be deflating the size of the ILI surge in later weeks of March.",

While we cannot directly measure the rate of such sub-clinical cases, we suggest that a number 105 of prior studies can be used to produce a lower-bound on this contribution. A recent study of passengers on the Diamond Princess cruise-ship accounted for right-censoring of patients sampled and estimated that 17.9% of patients infected with SARS-Cov-2 are asymptomatic for the course of their infection (95% credible set 15.5% to 20.2%). This estimate likely represents an underestimate given that the majority of passengers were >60 years old, a demographic thought to have a lower 110 asymptomatic rate than younger individuals [14] . Beyond asymptomatic individuals, prior studies of ILI surveillance have suggested that only 20-50% of ILI cases seek medical care [15, 16] . To produce a lower-bound prevalence estimate we take the higher end of this range and assume that 40% of ILI cases present to a health-care provider. Together these additional contributions from sub-clinical cases produces a lower bound of 8.7 million SARS-CoV-2 infections between March 115 8th and March 28th (95% credible set 8.0 million to 9.4 million). Prevalence estimates for each state within this time-period are shown in Figure S4 .",

We find a clear, anomalous surge in ILI outpatients during the COVID epidemic that correlates with the progression of the epidemic across the US. The surge of non-influenza ILI outpatients is much larger than the number of confirmed case in each state, providing evidence of large numbers of symptomatic probable COVID cases that remain undetected. The slowest 165 epidemic doubling time that could explain the ILI surge would be 4 days and this rate could only be achieved unusually fast early transmission or super-spreading events and a clinical rate near 100%. We measure the doubling time of deaths due to COVID with in the US to be 3.01 days and note that this is consistent with the bound imposed by the ILI surge. Together, the surge in ILI and analysis of doubling times suggest that SARS-CoV-2 has spread rapidly throughout the 170 US since it's January 15th start date and is likely accompanied by a large undiagnosed population of potential COVID outpatients with presumably milder distribution of clinical symptoms than estimated from prior studies of SARS-CoV-2+ inpatients.",

If the ILI dynamics were proportional to the epidemic curve then the two could be related with a constant subclinical rate. However, the changing ratio between the ILI surge and the epidemic curves parameterized by the growth rate of US deaths suggests additional mechanisms may be behind the ILI slowdown. First, a slowdown in ILI outpatient arrivals could be due to decrease in care-seeking where patients with mild ILI are less likely to present to the 180 hospital as evident in emergency departments across New York City. Adjusting our ILI prevalence estimates based on the effect observed in New York City aligns ILI estimates more closely with predicted dynamics, yet the discrepancy remains. The remaining deviation could reflect more extreme changes in patient behaviors than those seen in New York City or successful interventions leading to lower transmission rates.",

While early clinical reports focused on cough and fever as the dominant features of COVID [5] , other 190 reports have documented digestive symptoms as the complaint affecting up to half of patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID [19] , and alternative presentations, including asymptomatic or unnoticeable infections, could result in ILI surges underestimating SARS-CoV-2 prevalence.",

Second, our epidemic models are crude, US-wide SEIR models varying by growth rate alone and as such do not capture regional variation or intervention-induced changes in transmission. Our 200 models were used to estimate growth rates from ILI for testing with COVID data and to estimate the mutual dependency of growth rate, the lag between the onset of infection and presentation to a doctor, and clinical rates; these models were not intended to be fine-grained forecasts for municipality hospital burden and other common goals for COVID models.

Initially, April 2-5 were included but were found to have extremely high leverage and were hence excluded from our analysis. Data on COVID deaths in Italy were obtained from https://github.com/pcm-dpc/COVID-19. The same procedure was applied, focusing on deaths 280 from February 24 until March 12. The slope from poisson regression was used as the estimated exponential growth rate, yielding a US growth rate r U S = 0.23 or a 3.01 day doubling time and r IT = 0.26 or a 2.65 day doubling time.",

Adjusting the ILI surge based on an estimated influenza-like subclinical rate, 17.9% asymptomatic infections and decreased care seeking in New York does not reconcile the difference in magnitude or slope between the ILI surge and the epidemic curve from US growth rates, suggesting additional forces are at play. The cause of the apparent deceleration in the ILI surge is hypothesized to be due to some combination of successful social distancing, faster decreases in care-seeking behavior than measured in New York, and/or other possibilities including faster growth and higher subclinical rates. (b) If the growth rate in the US is faster than US deaths suggest, such as a growth rate observed in Italy prior to the Italian lockdown (2.645 day doubling time), it could provide alternative explanations of the curvature of the excess ILI through a larger subclinical rate and epidemic curves near their peak at the time of the peak of the ILI surge. Serology or other measures of prevalence are needed to reconcile these alternative hypotheses. (c) More generally, the ILI surge forces a dependence between growth rate (doubling time), the clinical rate, and the lag between the onset of infectiousness and presentation to the doctor with ILI, where faster growth implies a slower clinical rate.",

A binomial logistic-normal non-linear regression model was fit to non-influenza ILI data from 2010-2018 (grey lines). The model predicted the expected amount of non-influenza ILI in the 2019-2020 season (grey ribbons represent the 95% and 50% credible sets; the black line represents the posterior median). Observed non-influenza ILI beyond seasonal norms are shown as a blue line (posterior median) and blue ribbon (posterior 95% credible set). A number of regions are not represented due to insufficient laboratory influenza data to complete our analysis (see Methods for full details).",
