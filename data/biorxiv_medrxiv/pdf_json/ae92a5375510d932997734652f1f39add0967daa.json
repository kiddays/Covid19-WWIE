Currently, research groups around the globe are trying to figure out such transmission dynamics using different scientific and technological approaches. One of those is by using mathematical and computational models like the compartmental model or the agent-based models. In this paper, a general agent-based model, called INFEKTA, that combines the transmission dynamics of an infectious disease with agents (individuals) that can move on a complex network of accessible places defined over a Euclidean space representing a real town or city is proposed. The applicability of INFEKTA is shown by modeling the transmission dynamics of the COVID-19 in Bogot\u00e1 city, the capital of Colombia.",

This approach provides a 29 conceptual structure (a multi-level complex network [12] ) that allows characterizing the 30 interrelation and interaction between elements of a system and between the system and 31 its environment [13] . In this way, a system is composed of sub-systems of second order, 32 which in turn may be composed of subsystems of the third-order [14] . Transmission 33 dynamics of infectious diseases are not traditionally modeled at the individual level, but 34 at the population-level with a compartmental model.

In INFEKTA, the 138 infectious state of the SEIR model is divided into exposed, seriously-infected and 139 critically infected in order to capture how age, gender, IP preferences, medical 140 preconditions (co-morbidity), and social separation policies can impact the evolution of 141 the infectious disease in an individual. INFEKTA introduces both the M state since 142 some individuals are naturally immune to or can become immune to (after recovering) 143 to certain infectious diseases and the Dead (D) state to distinguish between recovered 144 and dead individuals.
