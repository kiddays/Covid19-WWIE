Similar to SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 exploits angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as a receptor to invade cells, notably type II alveolar epithelial cells. Importantly, ACE2 gene is highly polymorphic. Here we have used in silico tools to analyze the possible impact of ACE2 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) on the interaction with SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein. We found that S19P (common in African people) and K26R (common in European people) were, among the most diffused SNPs worldwide, the only two SNPs that were able to potentially affect the interaction of ACE2 with SARS-CoV-2 spike. FireDock simulations demonstrated that while S19P may decrease, K26R might increase the ACE2 affinity for SARS-CoV-2 Spike. This finding suggests that the S19P may genetically protect, and K26R may predispose to more severe SARS-CoV-2 disease.",

However, if we look at the even worst pandemics in the human history we can realize that ethnic and geographical differences in the susceptibility to disease actually exist, in spite of the infectious sources and transmission routes that are the same for all individuals 1 . The current SARS covid-19 (a shortened form of \"coronavirus disease of 2019\") epidemic spread appears to be similarly influenced by ethnical and geographical factors. After its initial spread in China, the pandemic is now progressing at an accelerating rate in Western Europe and the United States of America 2 . In these regions, the causative agent, the severe acute respiratory syndrome corona virus -2 (SARS-CoV-2) is spreading incredibly quickly between people, due to its newness -no one on earth has immunity to SARS Covid-19 -and transmission route. Yet, in the other regions of the world, the kinetics of diffusion and mortality seem less impressive, although the world has become highly interconnected as a result of a huge growth in trades and travels 2 .",

Contact residues are classified as: \"permanent\" (predicted as binding residues in all 10 models), \"stable\" (predicted as binding residues in 6 or 7 out 10 models), \"unstable\" (predicted as binding residues in 6 or 7 out 10 models), \"hyper-unstable\" (1 or 2 models out of 10). Twenty-seven substitutions were predicted to influence the ACE2/Spike interface in at least one of the different 3D PDB models. Fifteen and seventeen were predicted to affect the ACE2/B0AT1 and ACE2/ACE2 interfaces, respectively. Some residues, which are described in UNIPROT database (https://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/Q9BYF1) as important for the interaction between spike and ACE2, are permanent contact residues (predicted as binding) but all of these are non-polymorphic .

The data indicated that removal of glycosidic chains results in either an increased or a decreased \u0394G values, depending on the PDB model (Fig. 1c ). In particular, removal of glycosidic moieties apparently strengthened the ACE2/Spike interaction in SARS-CoV Spike/ACE2 in the 2AJF model, while it appeared to weaken the interaction between SARS-CoV-2 Spike and ACE2 in the 6VW1 model. In both cases, the effect was mostly due to removal of the terminal beta-mannose (BMA) (Fig. 1c) , which was predicted to decorate a glycosidic chain attached to aspartic amino acid residue at position 90 that maps in a helix that is involved in the interaction with Spike, as shown in Fig. 1d . Noteworthy, in the 6VW1 model, BMA is involved in two H-bonds and one pseudo-bond (Fig. 1e) , and these bonds are lost in non-glycosylated models. In contrast, in the 2AJF model, the BMA forms only one H-bond, and after removal of terminal BMA, the Thr-41 acquires more grads for binding thereby strengthening the interaction with ACE2. These results seem to suggest that ACE2 glycosylation may play a different role in modulating the interaction with SARS-CoV Spike and SARS-CoV-2",

Based on this result, the K26R and K26E could genetically predispose to more severe SARS-CoV-2 disease. In addition, several ACE2 SNPs were predicted to affect ACE2/ACE2 homo-dimerization (E668K, N638S, R716H, R710H) or ACE2/B0AT1 interaction (L731F)(Supplementary Fig. 3).Dynamic models of ACE2: fluctuation, deformation and chaperone requirement for correct topology maintenanceDynamut 36 was used to analyze dynamic features of ACE2 receptor including fluctuation and deformation.

Fig. 5ef depicts the CABS flex model of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 Spike, respectively while Fig. 5g illustrates the model of ACE2. CABS-flex model (Fig. 5ef) and fluctuation scores indicate that SARS-CoV Spike is characterized by higher flexibility of in a coiled-coil domain, with respect to SARS-CoV-2 Spike (Fig. 5h). This difference may affect the interaction with ACE2.Variation of the distance between the amino acid residues involved in ACE2 binding interfaces were then analyzed by Molecular Dynamics Simulation, a computer simulation method for analyzing the physical movements of atoms and molecules.Supplementary Fig. 4a and 4cshow, respectively, oscillation plot (in \u00e5ngstr\u00f6m) and variance of distance between the amino acid residues in the two helices that are involved in the SARS-CoV-2 Spike interaction, whileSupplementary Fig. 4b illustrates 3Dimages of regions containing the amino acid residues ofSupplementary Fig. 4a. Oscillation plots and variance of the distance of amino acid residues between the two helices and beta-sheet, and between the residues of the beta-sheet are illustrated inSupplementary Fig. 4d and 4f, and Supplementary Fig. 4e and 4g, respectively. Overall, the data indicate that, although the two helices in the binding interface with Spike protein form a compact structure, some residue can actually oscillate. Permanent amino acid residues (41-31) exhibit small oscillation by Molecular Dynamics Simulation. In contrast, stable or unstable residues exhibit a different behavior. The residue 21 occupies the first position in the model used (PDB 6M17) for simulation, and, as a consequence, it exhibits the highest oscillation degree. Interestingly, the",

The data of the amino acid substitutions in the three ACE2 interfaces (ACE2/SARS-CoV-2 Spike, ACE2/ACE2, ACE2/B0AT1) were then extrapolated (Supplementary Fig. 5b), and were excluded from the analysis that was aimed at predicting structural (indirect) effects of amino acid substitutions on binding interfaces. The resulting subset of data (Supplementary Fig. 5c) was combined by matching Dynamut 36 and ENCoM 42 predictions, and used to generate the final ordination plot shown in Fig. 6a. Results indicate that a considerable number of the amino acid substitutions are able to either stabilize or destabilize the binding interfaces with possible consequences on either ACE2 function and/or ACE2/SARS-CoV-2 Spike interaction. In particular, in Fig. 6b, the effects of amino acid substitutions on structure flexibility were calculated as \u0394\u0394G and/or \u0394\u0394S values comparing ACE2 and each polymorphic variant (red gain in flexibility, blue gain in rigidity). SNPs I468V, V488A and A501T were selected as the most common polymorphisms that gave the highest \u0394\u0394G and \u0394\u0394S values in our dynamic model. limitations and caveats of in silico technology, this study addresses the question of whether some ACE2 SNPs may be associated with a different individual susceptibility to COVID-19. To alleviate these limitations, we used a combination of bioinformatics tools, and tested different crystallographic models. Four months after the spread of the SARS COVID-19, its worldwide distribution remains extremely uneven. Lethality is even more inhomogeneous among and within countries, with figures of 12.6% in Italy 43 , and 0.6% in South Korea 44 . Although differences in mortality might have various causes, including access and efficiency of health systems, total number of people tested, presence and severity of symptoms in tested populations, they are so impressive that it seems legitimate to search for other factors possibly related to individuals as the elements of a population.",

Indeed, in the rodent blockade of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system limits the acute lung injury induced by the SARS-CoV-1 spike protein 49 , suggesting that if ACE2 function is preserved (because of increased baseline expression, as especially seen in pre-menopausal women), clinical course of infection might be less severe.It has been suggested that polymorphisms in the ACE2 gene could reduce the spike affinity, with subsequent lower susceptibility to infection: in this hypothesis, their geographical / ethnical distribution could explain the strong discrepancies in infection rate and/or lethality observed worldwide47 . Effectively, we showed by Network plot and Non-Metric Multidimensional Scaling that most of the SNPs diffused worldwide did not affect significantly the interaction of ACE2 with SARS-CoV-2 Spike. S19P was one of the rare polymorphisms able to potentially affect this interaction, by lowering the affinity. This polymorphism is more frequent in African populations, but its diffusion (0.3%) remains too low to explain, except in minimal part, the reduced death tollobserved so far in that continent, and, more generally, the enormous differences in geographical spread of infection and lethality. However, it seems clear that the affinity of the virus for ACE2 is a key determinant of its infective potential: in order to choose the experimental model capable of reproducing the essential aspects of human infection, Chan and colleagues 50 determined in silico the spike / ACE2 affinity in primates and in a series of experimental animals, observing that the binding energy is maximal in primates (-62.20 Rosetta energy units (REU)), intermediate in Syrian hamster (-49.96 REU), lower in bat (-39.60 REU)",

Recently, 2.9 \u00c5 resolution cryo-EM structure of full-length human ACE2 in complex with B0AT1 was presented, and structural modelling suggests that the ACE2-B0AT1 can bind two spike glycoproteins simultaneously20,21 . It has been hypothesized that the presence of B0AT1 may block the access of TMPRSS2 to the polymorphisms and blood pressure responses to the cold pressor test led to the hypothesis that the different polymorphism distribution worldwide may be the consequence of genetic adaptation to different climatic conditions 25,26 . In this study we have used a combination of in silico tools to analyze the possible impact of ACE2 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) on the interaction with SARS-CoV-2 Spike glycoprotein. Results seem to suggest that ACE2 polymorphism can contribute to ethnic and geographical differences in SARS COVID-19 spreading across the world.Results3D Protein Data Bank (PDB) models and in silico screening of ACE2 SNPs affecting bindingwith coronavirus Spike proteins.

A second step, which was carried out with SSIPe (SSIPe)33  , was aimed at estimating the effects of single SNPs, and to generate mutant models. Different SNPs lists were obtained, which were compared, and used to identify the most stable binding amino acid residues.SSIPe analysis performed with the PDB model 6M17 was used to map: the ACE2/Spike protein interaction interface, ACE2 /ACE2 dimerization interface, and B0AT1/ACE2 interaction interface.The model contains ACE2 in the dimeric form (with the hydrophobic domains) and B0AT1, while in all the others models the transmembrane domains, ACE2 /ACE2 interface and B0AT1/ACE2 interface are absent.",
