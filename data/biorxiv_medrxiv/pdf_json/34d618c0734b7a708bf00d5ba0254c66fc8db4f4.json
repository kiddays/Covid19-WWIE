The 20 nucleic acids are compartmentalized into aqueous microdroplets, picoliters in volume, separated 21 by an immiscible oil, and stabilized by a surfactant. In droplet qPCR, accurate data can only be 22 obtained if the drops remain stable to coalescence upon thermocycling and drop contents do not 23 diffuse to neighboring drops. In this work, we present a droplet qRT-PCR assay for quantifying 24 influenza A virus (IAV) following systematic testing of different PCR additives, resulting in the 25 optimal combination of Tween-20 / BSA / betaine to maintain drop stability and limit dye 26 diffusion. We use a standard qPCR machine to generate real time amplification curves of 27 hundreds of thousands of drops and correlate this data with constructed amplification curves 28 obtained from hundreds of drops sampled at various cycle numbers and imaged using 29 epifluorescence microscopy. To demonstrate the utility of our method, we tested a range of in 30 vitro transcribed M gene and IAV viral supernatant from infected cells. We directly amplified 31 IAV genomes from infected supernatant without an RNA extraction step.

Using Tween-20 / BSA / betaine as additives, five orders of 84 magnitude of in vitro transcribed viral RNA was resolved between drops ranging from 10 -1 to 85 10 4 copies per drop (cpd). Drops containing low (10 1 cpd) and high (10 4 cpd) viral RNA 86 concentrations were thermocycled using a standard qPCR machine and the qRT-PCR 87 amplification curves were comparable to constructed curves obtained from drops sampled at 88 various cycles using epifluorescence microscopy. The optimized droplet qRT-PCR assay was 89 used to quantify the number of A/California/07/2009 (H1N1) IAV genomes present in the 90 supernatant from infected A549 cells. At 24 hours post infection (hpi), we prepared six dilutions 91 of supernatant from infected cells to determine our detection limit for live virus. Using ddPCR 92 analysis, we were able to quantify IAV RNA directly from infected cells across four orders of 93 magnitude. We find that our limit of detection is at a dilution that corresponds to 0.274 cpd, 94 demonstrating that we are able to detect down to a single viral genome in a drop. In addition, we 95 amplified viral RNA from supernatant collected directed from infected cells without an RNA 96 extraction step.

This exponential phase 322 corresponds to a reaction efficiency of 100%, where all DNA is multiplied by a factor of two at 323 the completion of every cycle. Desired amplification efficiencies should fall between 90-324 110%. 42, 43 PCR efficiencies that fall outside of this range will limit dynamic range and 325 sensitivity. A dilution series of a known quantity of target RNA or DNA is required to create a 326 standard curve to relate cycle threshold (Ct) values to the common logarithm (log10) of the RNA 327 or DNA concentration. When a standard curve has a slope of -3.33, it indicates that the PCR 328 reaction efficiency is 100%. To perform a standard curve in drops, in vitro transcribed IAV M 329 gene RNA was added as template to the optimized qRT-PCR reaction mix with additives Tween-330 20 / BSA / betaine. Serial RNA dilutions of a range of 10 4 to 10 9 copies/\u00b5L in bulk were 331 generated, corresponding to a range of 10 -1 to 10 4 cpd. The amplification curves obtained using 332 qPCR in bulk (Fig. S3) follow the same trend as in drops (Fig. 2A) . The Ct values for the 333 dilution series in drops and in bulk were plotted to generate standard curves for both reactions 334 (Fig. 2B) . The slopes of the curves yield a droplet reaction efficiency of 90.3% compared to a 335 bulk reaction efficiency of 98.9%, with both falling within the desired 90-110% range (Fig. 2B) . 336",

The CV is calculated as 423 4 \" # , as defined by the Poisson distribution, where \u03bb is the RNA loading in cpd. The high RNA 424 loading condition resulted in all drops amplifying as predicted. In addition, the fluorescence 425 intensities of the high loading RNA condition showed tighter distributions at all cycles compared 426 to the amplified drops in the low RNA loading conditions. Representative images of drops for 427 both 1.7 x 10 1 and 1.7 x 10 4 cpd at early and late cycles provide a visual reference for the 428 distributions in the histograms (Fig. 3E) . The similar trend of drop measurements between the 429 qPCR machine and the epifluorescence images demonstrates that RNA concentrations in 430 individual drops can be extrapolated from real-time PCR amplification curves produced by either 431 standard qPCR thermocycling or epifluorescence microscopy.

The channel height of the device was 50 \u03bcm. Brightfield and fluorescence images 168 (Texas RED (TXRED, ex. 540-580 nm, em. 592-669 nm)) of the drops were captured on an 169 inverted epifluorescence microscope (Leica DMi8) with a 10x objective (Leica, NA 0.32). The 170 Leica Application Suite X was used for image acquisition. For each of the eight additive 171 conditions, drops were imaged from three PCR tubes and three FOV per tube (>100 drops per 172 FOV) were captured. 173 Analysis of endpoint brightfield and fluorescence imaging of drops containing 174 combinations of PCR additives 175 Drops imaged on the epifluorescence microscope were processed with a custom MATLAB 176 (R2019a) script to measure drop diameter and ROX fluorescence intensity. Measurements of 177 drop diameters D from at least 270 drops per condition were made following thermocycling. All 178 drop measurements were made on the TXRED channel of the acquired images. ROX 179 fluorescence intensities I were normalized by subtracting the background fluorescence IB. 180 Background fluorescence was set as the average pixel value measured from a small (100 px 2 ) 181 background region in the middle of the image using FIJI. 26 The device used for imaging had a 182 channel height of 50 \u00b5m, thereby compressing drops larger than 50 \u03bcm in diameter and skewing 183 larger drop diameter measurements. Thus, drop diameters greater than this height were adjusted 184 by estimating the compressed drops as oblate spheroids and then using the oblate spheroid 185 volume to calculate the equivalent sphere diameter using the equation ! = # \" # \u210e ! where DS is 186 the diameter of the equivalent sphere, DE is the measured diameter of a compressed drop, and h 187 is the channel height of 50 \u03bcm. Normalization of measured D from an initial drop diameter D0 188 was determined with the equation ( \u2212 $ )/ $ . The initial D0 is the average drop diameter 189 measured from drops without PCR additives upon exit from a drop making device as shown in 190 Fig. S1.

The 263 addition of Tween-20 alone to the PCR reaction mix resulted in a tight distribution of drop 264diameters. However, (D-D0)/D0 was below zero with a value of -0.12, indicating that the Tween-265 20 drops decreased in size from their initial diameters(Fig. 1B, red box). As the addition of 266Tween-20 decreased drop coalescence upon thermocycling, we proceeded to test different 267 combinations of the additives with Tween-20. Tween-20 was combined with PEG-6K, BSA and 268 BSA / betaine. The individual additives PEG-6K, BSA, and betaine were chosen as they were 269 utilized in prior droplet PCR assays.20, 35, 40, 41  By adding Tween-20 to each of these additives, 270 (D-D0)/D0 decreased below zero and were found to have lower coefficients of variation (CV) 271 than with no additives and with each of the additives alone without Tween-20(Fig. 1B). The 272 measured diameters indicate that the addition of Tween-20 greatly decreased both drop 273 coalescence and CV, although epifluorescence images show that Tween-20 / PEG-6K and 274 Tween-20 / BSA combinations still contained a number of large drops, indicating that the 275 problem of coalescence was not fully resolved.

A Poisson fit with an R 2 value of 0.987 was used to estimate the average number 475 of IAV genomes per drop at each dilution(Fig. 4A, green dashed line, Table S2). The undiluted 476 supernatant was estimated to contain 175 cpd, corresponding to 3.34 x 10 6 copies/\u00b5L. We477 compared this value to the measured concentration of the undiluted supernatant obtained using 478 qRT-PCR. The Ct value of the undiluted supernatant resulted in a concentration of 1.96 x 10 6 479 copies/\u00b5L, based upon the standard curve from Fig. 2A, in agreement with our Poisson estimate. 480 The supernatant dilutions (Fig. 4A, solid blue line) followed the Poisson fit down to the 10 -3 481 dilution (0.175 cpd). The background amplification level of mock infected cells was 0.082 cpd 482 (Fig. 4A, red dashed line). Representative images are shown and demonstrate that undiluted 483",

Air was purged from the uncured PDMS by placing the filled mold in a 138 vacuum chamber for at least 1 h. The PDMS was cured in an oven at 55 \u00b0C for 24 h and then 139 removed from the mold with a scalpel. Ports were punched into the PDMS slab with a 0.75 mm 140 diameter biopsy punch (EMS Rapid-Core, Electron Microscopy Sciences). The PDMS slab was 141 bonded to a 2-in by 3-in glass slide (VWR micro slides, cat. #48382-179) after plasma treatment 142 (Harrick Plasma PDC-001) for 60 s at high power (30 W) and 700 mTorr oxygen pressure. The 143 drop making devices were made hydrophobic by flowing Aquapel (Pittsburgh Glass Works) 144 through the channels, followed by blowing the channels with air filtered through a GVS 145 ABLUO\u2122 25 mm 0.2-\u03bcm filter (Fisher Scientific) before baking the devices in an oven at 55 \u00b0C 146 for 1 h. 147 Flow-focusing drop making devices were used to make 50 \u00b5m diameter drops for the drop 149 stability and PCR dilution experiments and 100 \u00b5m diameter drops for infected supernatant 150 experiments. 25 The dispersed phase consisted of qRT-PCR mix containing a range of 151 concentrations (10 3 to 10 8 copies/\u00b5L) of in vitro transcribed M gene RNA and different 152 combinations of additives (no additives, Tween-20 only, BSA only, PEG-6K only, betaine only, 153",
