During the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, daily tallies of the incidence (new cases on day ), recovered (individuals who are declared cured on day ) and deceased (individuals who die on day ) have become available for many countries and regions [7] . With this information, one might naively expect that can be determined as , (1) with . This definition is exactly equivalent to the expression for the basic reproduction number in a 'Susceptible-Infectious-Removed' (SIR) framework, but can be obviously applied to the observed data without any reference to a specific model. Calculations with Eq. (1) for COVID-19, however, disagree with values of computed from standard packages such as EPIESTIM [4] , as seen in Fig.  1 .",

For some countries, such as the United Kingdom, the published cumulative number of recovered people is less than the cumulative number of deceased individuals, a very unlikely scenario. Even globally, the sum total of deceased individuals is a substantial fraction of cured individuals, which is also highly implausible. Furthermore, there is a relative time shift between and , since the former includes the incubation time plus the time to develop symptoms serious enough to be reported. However, attempting to correct for this relative delay does not improve the agreement in Fig. 1 in any significant way.",

A more recent study finds 5.8 days, with 44% presymptomatic transmission [10] . The recovery time, on the other hand, is much longer, and this implies that individuals at advanced stages of the disease have a very low infectivity. Under these conditions Eq. (1) cannot be valid, since its denominator should not be but the number of people who became infected approximately at time . The latter is greater than the former during the ramp-up phase of the disease, and this explains why the curve calculated from Eq. (1) shows a higher during this time. Conversely, the number of people who became infected at time is less than at later stages, and this explains why the curve calculated from Eq.

A comparison between and is shown in the inset of Fig. 2 for the case of South Korea. The regularization method has the advantage that it distorts the shape of a curve less than a typical sliding average, while being superior to Savitzky-Golay [12] smoothing in terms of noise reduction. This was important in the context of the comparison made here between Eq. (2) and the EPIESTIM package, because artificial shape distortions are eliminated. For practical applications of Eq. (2), however, a simple 7day running average should suffice.",
