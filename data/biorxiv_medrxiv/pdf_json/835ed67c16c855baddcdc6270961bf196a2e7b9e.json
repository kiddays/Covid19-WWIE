Firstly, some qualitative properties of the model are analyzed. The basic reproduction number R 0 is derived. When R 0 < 1, the disease-free equilibrium point is unique and locally asymptotically stable. When R 0 > 1, the endemic equilibrium point is also unique. Furthermore, some conditions are established to ensure the local asymptotic stability of disease-free and endemic equilibrium points. The trend of COVID-19 spread in the United States is predicted. Considering the influence of the individual behavior and government mitigation measurement, a modified SEIQRP model is proposed, defined as SEIQRPD model. According to the real data of the United States, it is found that our improved model has a better prediction ability for the epidemic trend in the next two weeks. Hence, the epidemic trend of the United States in the next two weeks is investigated, and the peak of isolated cases are predicted. The modified SEIQRP model successfully capture the development process of COVID-19, which provides an important reference for understanding the trend of the outbreak.",

In [6] , the epidemics trend of COVID-19 in China was predicted under public health interventions. In [7] , the basic reproduction number of COVID-19 in China was estimated and the data-driven analysis was performed in the early phase of the outbreak. In order to pre-dict the cumulative number of confirmed cases and combine the actual measures taken by the government on the outbreak of COVID-19, we further put forward an improved SEIQR-P model, denoted by SEIQRPD model. At present, we can obtain the epidemic data of COVID-19 outbreak in the United States before April 20, 2020. We use these data and the improved model to predict the epidemic trend of the United States in the next two weeks, and estimate the peak of isolated cases. Firstly, the data before April 5 was selected to identify the model parameters, and the prediction ability of the improved model with the epidemiological data from April 6 to April 20 is verified. Then, the cumulative number of confirmed cases and isolated cases are predicted in the next two weeks. The peak of isolated cases is thus predicted.",

Through the fractional predictor corrector method and the least squares fitting, we can identify the parameters of the model (15) through the real data, which can be found in Table 1 . Based on the parameters in Table 1 , we can make a simple prediction of isolated cases and recovered cases in the United States, which can be found in Figure 1 . We need to emphasize that the peak here represents the number of isolated cases rather than the cumulative number of confirmed cases. Under the parameters in Table 1 , it can be calculated by using (9) that R 0 = 0.2041 < 1. By the conclusion in Theorem 3, the disease-free equilibrium point is local asymptotic stable. The SEIQRP model has a basic guiding significance for predicting and fitting spreading dynamics of COVID-19. However, the prediction of this model for COVID-19 is relatively rough, we still need to improve model (15) according to actual mitigation policies and research objectives. According to the analysis in Section 2, we choose the SEIQR-PD model to predict the trend of the epidemic in the United States under reasonable assumptions.",

Therefore, the data in Hubei, Guangdong, Hunan and Zhejiang are selected to research the fitting effect of the model (17) . According to the real data of these four regions in China, the parameters of the model (17) are identified, and the results are shown in Table 2 . The model (17) successfully capture the trend of the outbreak, which can be seen in Figure 3 . At present, we can obtain the epidemic data of the United States from January 22, 2020 to April 20, 2020. We need to preprocess the data to remove the data smaller than 0.5% of the current highest number of confirmed cases. In order to test the prediction ability of the SEIQRPD model (17) for the development process of the epidemic in the United States, we select the data before April 5 to identify the parameters of the SEIQRPD model (17) . Furthermore, in order to illustrate the ability of the SEIQRPD model (17) in predicting the outbreak, we compared the real data and fitted data after April 5, which can be seen in Table 3, Table  4 and Figure 4 . According to the results in Table 3 and Table 4 , it can be found that the real values of current isolated cases and cumulative confirmed cases fall within the range of 95% -105% of the predicted values. This shows that the SEIQRPD model (17) can effectively predict the data in the next two weeks.",

In order to predict COVID-19 effectively, we propose an improved SEIQRPD model according to the actual mitigation situation. According to the data of the United States before April 5, 2020, the trend of the outbreak in the United States from April 6 to April 20 is successfully predicted as compared to the real records. Then, using the data before April 20, 2020, we forecast the trend of the outbreak in the United States in the next two weeks, and estimate the peak of isolated cases and the date of the peak. The improved SEIQRP model proposed in this paper successfully captures the trend of COVID-19. The long-term prediction needs to adjust the model appropriately according to the change of policy and medical level. We will discuss in the future work.",
