            "text": "Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a positive single stranded RNA virus that causes a highly contagious Corona Virus Disease (COVID19). Entry of SARS-CoV-2 in human cells depends on binding of the viral spike (S) proteins to cellular receptor Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and on S protein priming by host cell serine protease TMPRSS2. Recently COVID19 has been declared pandemic by World Health Organization yet high differences in disease outcomes across countries have been seen. We provide evidences based on analyses of existing public datasets and by using various insilico approaches to explain some of these as factors that may explain population level differences. One of the key factors might be entry of virus in host cells due to differential interaction of viral proteins with host cell proteins due to different genetic backgrounds. Based on our findings, we conclude that higher expression of ACE2 facilitated by natural variations, acting as Expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) and with different frequencies in different populations, results in ACE2 homo-dimerization which is disadvantageous for TMPRSS2 mediated cleavage of ACE2 and becomes more difficult in presence of broad neutral amino acid transporter, B0AT1 (coded by SLC6A19), that usually does not express in Lungs. We also propose that the monomeric ACE2 has higher preferential binding with SARS-CoV-2 S-Protein vis-a-vis its dimerized counterpart. Further, eQTLs in TMPRSS2 and natural structural variations in the gene may also result in differential outcomes towards priming of viral S-protein, a critical step for entry of Virus in host cells. In addition, we suggest some other potential key host genes like ADAM17, RPS6, HNRNPA1, SUMO1, NACA, BTF3 and some other proteases as Cathepsins, that might have a critical role. Understanding these population specific differences may help in developing appropriate management strategies.",

SARS-CoV-2 is reported to be originated in bats [1] and transmitted to humans via unknown intermediate host. However, its origin is still being questioned time and again. With the declaration of SARS-CoV-2 as pandemic by World Health Organisation (WHO), extensive research worldwide has been carried out. It has been established that Human ACE2 mediates SARS-CoV-2 entry into cells through its Spike (S) Protein an primarily makes entry to host body through respiratory tract with recent reporting of nasal epithelial cells as potential initial infection site. [2] Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is functional receptor on human cells for this newly originated coronavirus [3] with higher affinity then severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) originated in 2002. [4] . However, no substantial evidence exists that ACE2 higher expression primarily is associated with degree of infection and in addition COVID19 lethality is mostly driven by the extent of underlying lung injury [5] whereas a negative correlation has been reported between ACE2 expression and lung injury [6] , making it an interesting question to explore.",

This results in hypothesis of differential genetic susceptibility to COVID19 and virulence of SARS-CoV-2 in different populations [9] . Efforts are being made worldwide to understand it better and it becomes complex with reports that BCG vaccination reduces morbidity and mortality for COVID19 in human population [10] . Due shed some light on better understanding of differential susceptibility to COVID19 and virulence of SARS-CoV-2.

Increased density of ACE2 on the cell surface has been observed to protect from lung injury [6] also been observed at many other instances.

This observation is significant since the cleaved ACE2 interacts more efficiently with the SARS CoV-2 RBD domain. To understand the mechanistic effect of dimerization, we conceived and simulated two situations: one, where ACE2 dimer is bound to two B0AT1 (SL6A19) and two, RBD domains of SARS CoV-2 and second, where only monomeric ACE2 is bound to one viral RBD. From the RMSF analysis of the simulated trajectories, we observed higher order fluctuation in monomeric ACE2's homodimerization interface while the rest of the ACE2 displayed a similar fluctuation profile including residues interacting with RBD ( Figure 2A) . PCA analysis and amino acid residue loadings on the PCs (PC1 in this case) reported slightly higher away ward conformational dynamics w.r.t RBD in dimeric ACE2 ( Figure 2B and C). This contrasting essential dynamics in dimeric ACE2 is explained well through the MM-GBSA based free energy of binding calculation between the 10th nanosecond final confirmation of ACE2-RBD complex. From both simulations through MM-GBSA method, 1.5 fold strong binding of monomeric ACE2-RBD complex compared to dimeric ACE2-RBD was observed (i.e. \u0394G=-75. 58 for Dimeric ACE2-RBD vs \u0394G=-116.98 for Monomeric ACE2-RBD Complex). This observation further explains the protective role of overexpressed ACE2, resulting in its dimerization and reduced affinity for the RBD domain of SARS CoV-2 S1 protein. As our current computational resources could not support longer simulations therefore, we propose longer simulations for robust statistical inference to understand this phenomenon in more details.",

As expression of ACE2 is less in Lungs thus, probably GTEx portal did not return cis-eQTLs for ACE2 gene in lungs.

These eQTLs remained the same across tissue sets and showed similar effect patterns in expression (Figure 6b ). Yet to corelate the expression of the gene with genomic variations, regions of the gene were explored for potential regulatory elements and overlapped it with common variations through table browser tool of UCSC genome browser with assumption that the variants having population level effect should be common variants (Figure 4d and 7) .

It could be speculated that only glycine was flexible enough to make these torsion angles, change at the location into another residue would force the local backbone into an incorrect conformation and may disturb the local structure. The variant residue was also observed to be more hydrophobic than the wild-type residue. Since sequence similarity search did not find any significant template at the N-terminal of this protein, we could not generate a quality model for isoform-2, which contains G8V variation; hence we carried out sequence-based stability analysis. The results suggest G8V variation could increase the stability of the TMPRSS2 protein with \u2206\u2206G value of -0.10 kcal/mol. Further, it is known that Arginine and lysine residues within amino acids 697 to 716 are essential for efficient ACE2 cleavage by TMPRSS2 [57] and recent studies have shown that SARS CoV-2 uses the ACE2 for entry and the serine protease TMPRSS2 for S protein priming. Based on information from previous studies, we docked the TMPRSS2 p.Val197Met wild-type and variant protein with ACE2 and S protein of SARS CoV-2. The docking results suggest that the variant 197M protein could promote the binding to S-protein and inhibit the binding with ACE2 (Figure 16) . However, these observations need critical revaluation as well as experimental work to understand these interactions better.",

As its expression was observed to be very low in Lungs we resolved to look for indirect signatures that may have putative role in providing differential susceptibility. We noticed several variations clustering together in a potential enhancer region (Figure 17d and e) and with differential frequencies in different populations. eQTL analyses at GTEx portal also showed huge list of potential SNPs upregulating or down regulating SLC6A19 expression in Pancreas, leaver and whole blood cells as well as with overlap with potential Transcription factor binding sites (Figure 17f) .

The higher expression of ACE2 facilitates homo-dimerization resulting in hindrance to TMPRSS2 mediated cleavage of ACE2. It becomes more difficult in presence of B0AT1 that usually does not express in Lungs. We also propose that the monomeric ACE2 has higher preferential binding with SARS-CoV-2 S-Protein vis-a-vis its dimerized counterpart. Further, natural variations in TMPRSS2, with potential functional role, and their differential frequencies may also result in differential outcomes towards interaction with ACE2 or priming of viral S-protein, a critical step for entry of Virus in host cells. In addition, we have identified some other potential key host genes like ADAM17, RPS6, HNRNPA1, SUMO1, NACA and BTF3, that might have a critical role. With all this background, it is anticipated that in populations like Indian populations, with highly diverse gene pool, a great variation in clinical outcomes is expected and that could be population/region specific, but primarily due to gene pool structure of the region, despite similar exposure levels to SARS CoV-2 and resources. Understanding these population specific differences may help in developing appropriate management strategies.",
