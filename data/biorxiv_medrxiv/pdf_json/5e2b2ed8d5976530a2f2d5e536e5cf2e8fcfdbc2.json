We ground our study in the 19 neotropics, where four arthropod-borne viruses (arboviruses) of zoonotic origin-yellow 20 fever, dengue, chikungunya, and Zika viruses-have separately been introduced into the 21 human population.

Based on model 398outcomes for the range of parameter values estimated to apply to the neotropics, they 399concluded that ZIKV has a high potential for enzootic establishment in the New World. 400The modeling approach ofAlthouse et al. (22)  can be applied to all four translocated 401 arboviruses circulating in the neotropics. In particular, we can examine how key differences 402between the different viruses may impact their relative risk of enzootic establishment. and therefore has the potential to impact the risk of spillback. However, a model is 407needed to explore whether these differences are likely to be relevant, particularly in the 408 context of the long lifespans of NewWorld sylvatic mosquitoes in South American enzootic 409 systems. To examine this question, we built on the model of Althouse et al. borne transmission in primates (22)-as our starting value and selected two additional values 425 at 7 day intervals: 14 days approximately represents mean values from mark-release-426 recapture studies in South America for Ae. albopictus in field conditions (116), and 21 days 427 approximately represents conservative mean values for Haemogogus spp. and Sabethes spp.",

            "text": "Holding parameters constant whenever possible allowed us to minimize model complexity and 33target the effects of our parameters of interest. Furthermore, for the majority of these parameters, 34there is not enough empirical data to accurately characterize differences between New World 35 species. Full lists of parameter values used for the simulations presented in Figure 2 of epidemics, and critical population size required for disease persistence in directly transmitted 50 pathogens (6-8). Given the short mosquito lifespan and the resulting interaction between EIP and 51 the length of the infectious period, epidemic dynamics would be more sensitive to the 52 distribution of waiting periods in the mosquito vector than in the primate host. Thus, we explored 53 the effect of modeling the latent period in the mosquito vector (EIP) as an Erlang distribution by 54 splitting the latent period into a series of separate compartments, commonly referred to as a 55 boxcar configuration (9). 56We constructed two models with Erlang-distributed EIPs-a model with 10 exposed 57compartments, and a model with 50 exposed compartments. Figure S1 demonstrates the 58 differences between the probability distributions of the exponentially-distributed EIP relative to 59both Erlang-distributed EIPs. As expected, modeling EIP as less-dispersed Erlang distributions 60 resulted in higher probabilities of longer EIPs, thus decreasing the probability of sylvatic 61persistence. However, the Erlang-distributed models produced the same general trends as the 62 exponentially distributed models, with shorter EIPs and longer mosquito lifespans increasing the 63 probability of sylvatic establishment. As a result, in the interest of minimizing model complexity, 64in our main text, we report results from our exponentially-distributed model. Simulation results 65 from the Erlang-distributed models with respect to differences in the mosquito EIP and lifespan 66 are presented in Figure S2 and S3. periods (such as the EIP) in traditional compartment models follow exponential probability 75 distributions (in blue). In the case of EIP, this assumption is unrealistic because individuals have 76 an equal probability of leaving the incubation compartment regardless of the time since infection. 77In reality, the probability of progressing should be very low immediately after infection and 78highest around the EIP mean-a trajectory better represented by a gamma distribution (in green 79 and purple). A gamma distributed EIP can be constructed in a compartmental model via a boxcar 80 configuration of the latent period (i.e., splitting the latent period up into a series of separate 81 compartments, or boxes). Note how as the number of latent boxes increases (green vs. purple), 82the gamma distribution becomes less dispersed, and more closely centered around the EIP mean. Mosquito birthrate = 1/lifespan and increases from the top to bottom panels, while EIP increases 97 left to right. Here, we constructed an Erlang-distributed EIP by splitting the exposed 98 compartment into 50 separate boxes. Within each panel, the total population size of mosquitoes 99 (in two populations) and primates (in two populations) changes horizontally and vertically, 100respectively. For each parameter set, we simulated the introduction of a single infected primate 101 and subsequent transmission for a three-year period. Blue indicates no simulations establishing, 102whereas red indicates all simulations establishing. Contour lines show 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, and 0.95 103 probability of establishment. 104",
