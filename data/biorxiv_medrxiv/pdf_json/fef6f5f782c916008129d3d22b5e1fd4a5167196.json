            "text": "A global cross-discipline effort is ongoing to characterize the evolution of SARS-CoV-2 virus and generate reliable epidemiological models of its diffusion. To this end, phylogenomic approaches leverage accumulating genomic mutations as barcodes to track the evolutionary history of the virus and can benefit from the surge of sequences deposited in public databases. Yet, such methods typically rely on consensus sequences representing the dominant virus lineage, whereas a complex sublineage architecture is often observed within single hosts. Furthermore, most approaches do not account for variants accumulation processes and might produce inaccurate results in condition of limited sampling, as witnessed in most countries currently affected by the epidemics. We here introduce a new framework for the characterization of viral (sub)lineage evolution and transmission of SARS-CoV-2, which considers both clonal and intra-host minor variants and exploits the achievements of cancer evolution research to account for mutation accumulation and uncertainty in the data. The application of our approach to 18 SARS-CoV-2 samples for which raw sequencing data are available reveals a high-resolution phylogenomic model, which confirms and improves recent findings on viral types and highlights the existence of patterns of co-occurrence of minor variants, uncovering likely infection paths among hosts harboring the same viral lineage. Our findings confirm a significant increase of genomic diversity of SARS-CoV-2 in time, which is reflected in minor variants, and show that standard methods may struggle when handling datasets with important sampling limitations. Importantly, our framework allows to pinpoint minor variants that might be positively selected across distinct lineages and regions of the viral genome under purifying selection, thus driving the design of treatments and vaccines. In particular, minor variant g.29039A>U, detected in multiple viral lineages and validated on an independent dataset, shows that SARS-CoV-2 can lose its main Nucleocapsid immunogenic epitopes, raising concerns about the effectiveness of vaccines targeting the C-terminus of this protein.",

Due to the combination of high replication and mutation rates, populations of viruses with distinct sublineages can coexist within the same host, as shown by studies on numerous diseases [15, 16, 6] . Most mutations have no functional effect and follow a neutral evolutionary dynamics, driven by replication and degradation, and frequently involve genome positions that are highly prone to errors [17] . Certain variants, however, can be positively selected as a result of the strong immunologic pressure within human hosts [18] . Consequently, a complex architecture of viral (sub)lineages is often observed in infected individuals. In particular, it was recently shown that an unexpected high number of intra-hosts variants is observed in SARS-CoV-2 genomes, a proportion of which are observed in distinct hosts [19, 20] . Yet, the mechanisms of emergence and transmission of such variants in the population are still elusive.",

Even though, in optimal sampling conditions and in a timescale adequate to cover the whole evolutionary history of a virus, such methods are expected to produce reliable results, current circumstances have highlighted extremely partial and inhomogeneous samplings, both in geographical and temporal terms, in several countries worldwide [14] . In such cases, the genetic distance among hosts might not reflect the temporal ordering among mutational events and, accordingly, may induce erroneous inferences on the infection chain (see Fig. 1E ). Notice also that some of the aforementioned approaches integrate genomic and clinical data, such as collection date, In particular, all hosts share the same clonal mutation (U/C, green), but two of them (#2 and #3) are characterized by a distinct minor mutation (A/U, red), which randomly emerged in host #2 and was transferred to host #3 during the infection. Standard sequencing experiments return an identical consensus RNA sequence for all samples, by employing a threshold on variant frequency (VF) and by selecting mutations characterizing the dominant lineage. (B) By analyzing identical sequences, standard phylogenetic algorithms cannot disentangle any ordering or evolutionary relation among hosts infected by the same viral lineage. (C) By considering the VF distribution, it is possible to compute a refined genomic distance among hosts, as well as to identify a higher-resolution ordering within hosts infected by the same viral lineage, which may indicate possible transmission paths (in the example, we show a distance-based dendrogram). (D) In this second toy example, 6 infected hosts infected by two independent viral lineages are shown. An individual of each lineage (#3 and #6) display the same minor variant (dark red), which might indicate homoplasy. By analyzing the VF profile of all samples, it is possible to pinpoint such variant, which either is positively selected or recurrent neutral. (E) In this example, the branched evolution of 7 viral lineages is displayed (for simplicity all shown mutations are clonal and no sublineages are considered). 4 infected hosts harboring distinct clonal variants are tested and sequenced during the epidemics, revealing a typical scenario affected by sampling limitations. (F) From sequencing data of such hosts, distance-based and parsimony phylogenetic methods might return partial or incorrect evolutionary trees. By employing methods that account for mutation accumulation, the correct evolutionary model is inferred. In this representation, each sample is a leaf of the tree, positioned at a level corresponding to its mutational burden, whereas edges starting from the root R are labeled with the number of accumulating mutations. In the example, host #1 is parent of host #2 and #3, and the latter is a parent of host #4.",

Second, for most samples characterized by distinct viral lineages the method cannot return any temporal ordering, despite different distances with the ancestors are returned. For instance, from the MrBayes model it is not possible to determine whether sample SRR11241254 is a child of either sample SRR11177792 or of cluster C 1 , while it is evident from both our model and the heatmap ( Fig. 2A) that two independent branches originate from cluster C 1 toward both samples. Finally, by construction, the method cannot identify any distance-based ordering among individuals infected by the same viral lineage. Also the Nextstrain-Augur model (Suppl. Fig. 2 ) appears to show some limits. For instance, the model is able to distinguish the two main branches, but the ordering among clades appear to be quite arbitrary, especially with respect to the elements of type A (S) (right branch of our model).

This result would support the hypothesis that the overall genomic diversity of SARS-CoV-2 is progressively increasing [29, 19] , also proving that such phenomenon is partially reflected on minor variants. g Interestingly, several intra-host minor variants are found in a relatively large number of samples, as well as in different clusters/lineages and might indicate homoplasies. In this respect, in Fig. 2F we display for each minor variant the number of clusters/lineages in which it is observed, as compared to its median variant frequency. One could suppose that variants that are privately detected in single clusters (left region of the scatterplot) might result from infection events, whereas those found in a considerable number of lineages (right region of the scatterplot) are either positively selected or recurrent neutral mutations, although the presence of sequencing artifacts cannot be formally excluded, despite the high quality of all the reported variant calls.

The g.29039A>U is a nonsense mutation occurring in the linker region of the Nucleocapsid protein, close to the 3 end of the viral genome and causing the substitution of Lysine 256 with a stop codon (p.Lys256 * ; see Fig. 3 ). This mutation is present, at subclonal level, in 14/18 samples of our study cohort, with a median intra-host variant frequency of 0.1076 and is also confirmed in dataset PRJNA6079. The locus of the g.29039A>U mutation is particularly complex, with the mutated nucleotide being the center of symmetry of a perfect 19bp palindromic hairpin sequence. Notably, in many samples the presence of a large number of supplementary reads suggests that this hairpin region may be also a hotspot for more complex rearrangements, likely occurring through RdRp mediated template switching (Suppl. Fig. 3) . The functional effect of these rearrangements is the generation of a stop codon in the linker region, similarly to what observed for g.29039A>U. Studies done on SARS-CoV Nucleocapsid (N) protein allowed to identify two non-interacting structural domains, one N-terminal, known as the RNA-Binding Domain (RBD) and one C-terminal, known as the dimerization domain (DD) [33] . RBD and DD domains are separated by a disordered region playing a putative role as a flexible linker. The RBD directly interacts with the viral single-stranded RNA, generating the ribonucleoprotein core, while the C-terminal DD domain is responsible for protein dimerization, although its functional role is yet unknown. A comparison between the N protein of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 reveals a percent identity and similarity of 90.5% and 94.1%, respectively (Suppl. Fig. 4) , indicating that the two N proteins share a very similar structural organization. Recently, a set of putative SARS-CoV-2 B-and T-immunogenic peptides were identified by homology to those experimentally defined in SARS-CoV [34, 35] . Interestingly, the majority of the immunogenic epitopes of the Nucleocapsid protein (13 out of 18) are located in the C-terminus of the protein, in the linker region and DD domain and right after Lysine 256 (see Fig. 3 ; Suppl. Table 2 ).",

Indeed, several studies demonstrated that antibodies raised against the N protein upon SARS-CoV infection are abundantly expressed [36] , albeit short-lived [37] . In contrast, T cell-mediated immune responses can provide long-term protection after SARS-CoV infection [38, 39, 37] . In line with these data, sequence homology and bioinformatic approaches indicate that the Nucleocapsid, together with the Spike protein, are among the most promising targets for DNA vaccine development [40] . Not surprisingly, vaccines for both proteins have been already developed for SARS [41] . In this context, the identification of a subclonal nonsense variant, occurring in patients' samples and suppressing the expression of the immunogenic Nucleocapsid DD domain, may suggest a potentially limited effectiveness of veccines targeting this region for at least two reasons: i) because resistant subclones, such as the g.29039A>U variant, are already present in the wild, probably owing to the natural selective pressure exerted by the host immune system and ii) because the DD domain could be non-essential for the survival and infectiousness of the virus, as opposite to the RBD and therefore it could be easily lost upon exposure to the selective pressure raised by the vaccine.",

(A) Heatmap returning the variant frequency (VF) profiles of 18 SARS-CoV-2 + patients on 44 selected single-nucleotide variants. Samples are annotated with collection date and location. The phylogenetic lineage tree returned by MIPUP [22] by considering clonal variants (VF > 0.50) is displayed at the top of the heatmap. The squared node labeled with capital R indicates the reference genome REF-ANC, whereas the circled nodes indicate the number of variants characterizing each ancestral relation; colored shades indicate SARS-CoV-2 types from [12, 32]. In the middle panel, the model returned by LICHeE on each non-singleton cluster, by considering minor variants only is shown. Leafs represent samples and the internal nodes indicate the number of minor variants accumulating along that path. Confluences (marked in blue) represent uncertain ancestral relations for samples with noisy VF profiles. Variants colored in blue characterize the B (L) type [12, 32] and the left branch of the model, whereas variant g.29039A>U is colored in red. (B) Scatterplot displaying for each sample the number of clonal and minor variants (colors represent the clusters of panel A). (C) Boxplots returning the distribution of the number of clonal and minor variants, obtained by grouping samples according to collection date (Dec/Jan vs. Feb/Mar). (D-E)Heatmamps returning the genomic distance computed on either clonal or minor variants. (F) Scatterplot returning, for each minor variant, the number of clusters/lineages in which the variant is found (x axis) and the median variant frequency (y axis).

Hence, in order to define a unique ancestral reference genome to be used in downstream analyses, we here employed the bat coronavirus RaTG13 genome from [1] (GenBank: MN996532.1) to disambiguate the SNPs at those locations. Accordingly, we here define the reference genome REF-ANC with haplotype UCUCU at the 5 locations listed above. Reference genome REF-ANC represents an extremely likely ancestral genome, preceding both ref. #1 and ref. #2, and was used for variant calling (REF-ANC is released in FASTA format as Suppl.
