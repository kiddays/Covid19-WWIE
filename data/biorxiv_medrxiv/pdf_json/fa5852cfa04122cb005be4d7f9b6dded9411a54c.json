Methods: In the first phase, nasopharyngeal swab samples from the inbound population were numbered and grouped. The samples in the group were mixed together, and a NAT test was performed. When the test result is negative, it means that everyone in the group is not infected and the screening of the group is complete. When the test results were positive, the group moved on to the second stage. In the second stage, all samples in the positive group will be tested individually for NAT.",

The savings rate was higher if two or more patients were found in the same group, or if the method was repeated in the positive group. The cost of NAT was at least 960,000 RMB, based on the average of more than 6,000 test visits per day in Beijing. Using this method, Beijing can save 940,000 RMB per day in testing costs and 28.2 million RMB in 30 days.

Each group had 117 samples A and 117 samples B, and all samples A mixed together for one NAT.

When the test result was positive, it means that at least one of the 117 people tested positive. All samples B in the positive group underwent a second stage of testing. In the second stage, all samples B from the positive group were tested individually with NAT for a total of 117 tests.
