We analyzed scenarios implementing strong containment measures, similar to those imposed in Europe. The model predicts that an immediate implementation of strong containment measures (on the 19th of April) will significantly reduce the death count.

This doubling time is very close to the one characterizing the early spreading dynamics in Wuhan, China [2, 3]. The last few data points seem to slightly depart from the exponential curve. It is difficult to assess at this stage whether this departure is due to early containment measures, or simply due to fluctuations.

The model permits to describe the import of cases from outside the region, assesses the case load on hospitals and intensive care units (ICUs) and includes a mortality risk due to ICUs exceeding capacity. It has recently been used to assess the epidemic risk in the Chicago, USA metropolitan area [6] . These characteristics make it an ideal model for our aims.

To this aim, we used currently available estimates on COVID-19 parameters such as its incubation time and serial time [7] [8] [9] , information about air travelers to Okinawa, data on age distribution of the Okinawan population, and daily number of confirmed and hospitalized cases in the Okinawan prefecture [1].

A crucial parameter to describe an epidemic is R 0 , the average number of infection caused by one infected person. We find that an R 0 close to 2.5 provides a good fit of rate of increase in the number of hospitalized case as a function of time. Beside the parameters discussed in Methods, we had to make an assumption about the initial number of cases. We conventionally set the start of the simulation on the 15th of March 2020, a few days before the recent outbreak. We adjusted the initial number of cases so that the model fitted the number of hospitalized patients. Such procedure leads to estimate that in Okinawa there were about 10 cases on the 15th of March.",

In particular, the model infers that by the 15th of April there were several thousands of infected and already recovered people in Okinawa -a number about 50 times larger than the number of confirmed cases. To understand this discrepancy, we compared with estimates from Europe. A recent study [8] performed a Bayesian analysis to estimate the percentage of infected populations in European countries on the 15th of March, 2020. We compared their results with the numbers of confirmed cases in Table III . This analysis reveals similar ratios between estimated and confirmed cases, especially in countries that did not perform extensive testing.

The predicted cumulative death count by the end of the epidemic exceeds 20,000 people. A large fraction of these deaths are predicted to occur after the peak in the number of infections. A crucial assumption underlying this number is that the death rate of critical patients is doubled if no ICU bed is available.

This supports that our result is robust with respect to model idiosyncrasies. We used the alternative model to estimate the error made in using the Japanese age distribution as a proxy of the Okinawan one.

This percentage is chosen so that R t is below one, meaning that the measure is sufficient to stop the epidemic. In the containment scenarios discussed so far, it is crucial that the implemented measures reduce R t below one. To show that this is the case, we simulated a scenario in which containment measures implemented on the 19th of April reduces R t by only 40% with respect to R 0 , see Fig. 4 . Our model predicts that such measures will significantly slow down the epidemic, delaying its peak to the beginning of July. However, in the presence of such measures the model predicts a total death count at the end of the epidemic of about 14,000 and a required ICU capacity at the peak of about 2700 beds.",

An analysis of containment measures introduced in different European countries attempts at dissecting the impact on R t by these measures [8] , see Table I . The median effect on R t of measures such as school closure, increased social distancing and public events is rather moderate according to this analysis. It should be noted that these estimates are affected by a large variability, caused by data quality and different ways in which these measures have been implemented in different countries. A \"lockdown\" requires people to remain at home wherever possible, leaving their house for essential trips only (to buy food, medicine, and take daily exercise), and avoiding groups. The analysis in Table I shows that lockdowns in Europe have reduced R t much more effectively than other measures. Combined with our modeling results, this leads to the conclusion that Okinawa should consider imposing soon some sort of lockdown.",

Recent analysis suggest a serial interval, i.e. a time between consecutive infection in a chain of transmission, on the order of 5 to 6 days [9] .

Due to containment, R t is expected to be is reduced compared to R 0 , which is the same parameter in the absence of containment measures.
