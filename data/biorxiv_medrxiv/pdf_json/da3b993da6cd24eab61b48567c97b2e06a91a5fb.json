In Louisiana, African Americans account for 70% of COVID-19 deaths despite representing only 32% of the population. 2 In a Boston homeless shelter, 100% of 147 COVID-19 positive subjects were asymptomatic. 3 The mechanisms underlying severe COVID-19 should account for both these findings, as well as other COVID-19 mortality risk factors: hypertension, obesity, male sex, advanced age, concentration in northern climates, and COVID-19 associated coagulopathy (CAC). 4, 5 Vitamin D insufficiency (VDI) meets every one of the above criteria. VDI affects 80-90% of the African American population. In contrast, homeless persons generally have poorer health and nutrition, but can have greater exposure to sunlight, the source of 80-90% of the body's vitamin D. 6 VDI causes essential hypertension and is associated with every COVID-19 mortality risk factor. 7, 8 Hydroxychloroquine raises plasma vitamin D levels. 9 Lastly, VDI induces a prothrombotic state and adversely impacts both innate and adaptive immune responses. To better define the VDI-COVID-19 link, we determined the prevalence of VDI among our COVID-19 intensive care unit (ICU) patients.",

Subjects were included for whom serum 25-hydroxycholecalcifoerol (25OHD) levels were determined. COVID-19-relevant data were compiled and analyzed. The 25OHD assay was is highly prevalent in dark-skinned persons (82.1% of African Americans vs. 41.6% overall). In contrast, although U.S. homeless persons are generally considered to have poor health and decreased access to micronutrients that confer immune benefits, they usually have more exposure to sunlight, a key source of vitamin D production. In Europe, COVID-19 has been severe in Italy, Spain and Greece, but much less so in Scandinavian countries -this precisely recapitulates VDI data showing that Italy, Spain and Greece have VDI rates of 70-90%, vs. 15-30% in Norway and Denmark. 11 Scandinavian diets contain more vitamin D due to higher fatty fish intake and dairy products supplementation with vitamin D. 11 The baseline prevalence of VDI amongst ICU patients is 30-40%. 12 In this study, we found that 84.6% of COVID-19 ICU patients had VDI, vs. 57.1% of floor patients. Strikingly, 100% of ICU patients less than 75 years old had VDI. We also found that 62.5% had CAC, and 92.3% had lymphopenia. Given these data, we hypothesize that VDI enhances COVID-19 severity via 1) its prothrombotic effects and 2) its derangement of the immune response.",

The American Society of Hematology recommends routine DVT prophylaxis for all admitted COVID-19 patients. 13 In Wuhan, CAC was present in 71.4% of non-survivors vs. 0.6% in survivors. 14 Non-survivors demonstrated significantly lower fibrinogen and antithrombin levels on admission, consistent with coagulation factor depletion induced by a hypercoagulable state. A meta-analysis of 1,779 COVID-19 patients reported that platelet counts were significantly lower in severe COVID-19, and that lower platelet counts were associated with mortality. 15 Anticoagulation can lower mortality: in patients with high SIC scores or D-dimer levels >6-fold the upper limit of normal, heparin reduced mortality to 40.0% vs. 64.2% in controls. 16 CAC's role is further evidenced by the multiorgan, microvascular clots in hospitalized COVID-19 patients, which include deep vein thromboses/pulmonary emboli, acute renal failure, cerebrovascular events, myocardial injury, ischemic stroke, and ischemic skin changes. 4 Microthromboses are found in extrapulmonary organs at a rate greater than in severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), another novel coronavirus. 17 All rights reserved.

Vitamin D-dependent antimicrobial pathways are induced in response to double-stranded RNA, as produced during SARS-CoV-2 replication. 26 These pathways upregulate antimicrobial peptides, including cathelicidin and \uf062-defensin, and autophagy. In macrophages and endothelial cells, cathelicidin production is modulated in a vitamin D dose-dependent manner. 27-29 IFN-\uf067 is strongly antimicrobial and a key activator of these pathways, particularly for macrophages and other phagocytic cells, resulting in greater production of reactive oxygen through an oxidative burst and nitrogen species, in addition to these antimicrobial peptides. The over-utilization of these pathways by the host response to SARS-CoV-2 designed to control viral replication could be one mechanism by which VDI arises initially, but once VDI is present, this response becomes ineffective.",

The massive influx of macrophages and T cells into peripheral organs, including the CNS, may represent the mechanism by which lymphocytopenia arises and could suggest an autoimmune component to the disease. The concept that COVID-19 may impact the CNS is supported by reports of loss of smell and taste by patients and the elevated incidence of ischemic stroke. 31,32",

VDR exist in all major cardiovascular cell types, including cardiomyocytes, arterial wall cells, and immune cells. Studies have established that vitamin D metabolites are integral to vascular function and disease, including inflammation and thrombosis. For example, 1,25(OH)2D exerts anticoagulant effects by upregulating the expression of thrombomodulin (an anticoagulant glycoprotein) and downregulating the expression of tissue factor (a critical coagulation factor) in monocytes and human aortic smooth muscle cells. 19",
