Avoiding crowded places and keeping a safe distance from anyone, are considered among the most important preventive measures, as SARS-CoV-2 is known to be transmitted via droplets [12, 13] . Since the virus is also known to be transmitted through close contact, any form of physical social greetings should be avoided [12] . The preventative approach also includes: practicing regular hygiene and sanitation measures such as hand washing, constant disinfection of surfaces and wearing masks and gloves as appropriate [14] . Abstaining from travel and avoiding people who have been to countries highly impacted by the pandemic is of paramount importance [14] . It is crucial as well to prevent the spread of infection, which is done by practicing coughing and sneezing etiquette and self-isolating in case of suspected infection with the virus [11, 14] .",

To assess knowledge of the participants on the virus and the disease, several items were included that evaluated signs and symptoms, transmission routes, protective measures, therapeutic use of antibiotics, availability of vaccine for COVID-19, and belief in the assumption that summer heat can inactivate SARS-CoV-2. In addition, the survey items included a section on sources of information about the disease including social media platforms. A specific item was used to evaluate the belief of each participant that COVID-19 pandemic is part of a global conspiracy.

            "text": "The main study findings are the following: students at the UJ displayed relatively high level of knowledge about COVID-19, which was shown by high mean K-score. More than 80% of the participants correctly identified the commonly reported signs and symptoms of COVID-19 (fever, cough and shortness of breath). In addition, the students showed high level of knowledge regarding the transmission routes (fomites and droplet transmission through sneezing or coughing) and the preventive methods. This level of knowledge might be attributed to mass awareness campaigns via different media channels including the UJ, MoH, and news websites and their social media pages and accounts, besides the massive awareness campaigns on TV and the internet. Also, this result can stem from the desire of the students to actively seek knowledge about this disease that strongly affected their lives including educational, social and mental aspects. However, important gaps in knowledge regarding other possible modes of transmission were identified. This included about one-fifth of the participants missing the importance of crowded places as a possible setting for virus transmission. Such places can increase the chance of exposure to respiratory droplets, with the possibility of transmission from infected people lacking symptoms [13, 43, 44] . In addition, transmission via blood was incorrectly identified by 17.8% of the students. Despite concerns related to infrequent detection of SARS-CoV-2 in blood, no evidence of confirmed or even suspected blood-borne cases of COVID-19 were reported. This pattern was also seen in SARS and MERS, the two other recent emerging coronavirus epidemics [45, 46] . In addition, the participants had sufficient knowledge regarding the unavailability of an effective vaccine and the uselessness of antibiotics for COVID-19.",

In addition, females had higher anxiety levels; females tend to worry and overthink more, leading to anxiety, as opposed to males who use distractions as a coping mechanism [47, 48] . Additionally, non-Jordanian females had significantly higher anxiety levels, and this can be the result of being abroad and probably spending the quarantine away from their families, causing them to be more anxious.",

Furthermore, willingness to participate, especially on an online-based survey, may have been limited. Another shortcoming was the female predominance in the sample and higher number of participants that were affiliated to Health and Scientific Schools. One important point should be clarified, which is related to the scoring system that was used to assess the level of knowledge among participants regarding COVID-19. This assessment tool might be arbitrary and subjective.
