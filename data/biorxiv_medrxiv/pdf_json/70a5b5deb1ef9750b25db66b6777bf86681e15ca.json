Previous studies have variably shown ACE2 protein in the upper and lower 67 respiratory tract, but cellular localization and distribution in human lung tissues have been 68 inconsistent and contradictory (7-10) (Supplemental Table 1 ). In vitro studies demonstrate that 69 ACE2 is expressed at the apical membrane of polarized airway epithelia, where it permits viral 70 interaction and cell entry (10, 11). Here, we investigated the hypothesis that ACE2 expression 71 drives disease severity in susceptible patient populations through enhanced abundance or 72 distribution of ACE2 in different locations or cell types of the respiratory tract. 73 74 Severe COVID-19 is characterized by pneumonia and acute lung injury, so we first 75 assessed publicly available scRNA-seq data from distal lung biopsies (12) and evaluated ACE2 76 transcript abundance in specific cell types. In the alveoli, most ACE2 transcripts were in alveolar 77 type II (AT2) cells (89.5% of ACE2 + cells) (Figure 1a) , but specifically within a subset of these 78 cells (1.2% of AT2 cells) (Figure 1b, Supplemental Figure 1a -b). Next, we optimized and 79 validated ACE2 immunohistochemistry in extrapulmonary control tissues with high ACE2 80 expression (Supplemental Figure 2) . We evaluated human lung tissues by immunohistochemistry 81 (Supplemental Table 2 and Supplemental Table 3 ). Alveoli exhibited apical ACE2 protein in a 82 small number (usually ~1% or less) of AT2 cells (Figure 1c) , consistent with the results from 83 scRNA-seq. The identity of these cells was confirmed by co-staining for surfactant protein-C. 84",

In this larger study, we saw regional distribution of ACE2 protein varied between 114 donors. We detected ACE2 protein in surface epithelium of large airways in only 12% of 115 tracheal and 27% of bronchial tissues (Figure 3a ). In the distal areas of the lung, ACE2 was more 116 common, with positive protein detection in 36% of bronchiolar and 59% of alveolar samples 117 ( Figure 3a) . A similar pattern of variable alveolar ACE2 was seen for mRNA transcripts in the 118 scRNA-seq data, where 50% of donors showed low expression in AT2 cells, and the other 50% 119 of donors showed high expression in the same cell type (Figure 3b ).

In the cohort, neither age nor sex were associated with 139 ACE2 protein detection (using the median age as cut-off) (Figures 3c-d) . Since recent studies of 140 COVID-19 infections suggested that young children may have reduced disease severity when 141 infected by SARS-CoV-2 (6, 19), we compared lung tissue samples from children <10 years of 142 age to those from older subjects (19-71 years of age) and found that ACE2 protein detection was 143 higher in this subset of young children (Figure 3e ). To test whether ACE2 distribution was 144 affected by the presence of underlying diseases, we assessed the ACE2 localization pattern using 145 tissues from subjects with chronic comorbidities (asthma, cardiovascular disease, chronic 146 obstructive pulmonary disease, cystic fibrosis, diabetes, and smokers) and compared them to 147 controls (Supplemental Table 2 ). The control group was similar in age to the chronic disease 148 group (Figure 3f ). We observed no significant differences between the two groups in ACE2 149 .

Through study of these respiratory tissues, we found that ACE2 protein was most 177 consistently detected in the sinonasal cavity and the alveoli. Expression of ACE2 in the nasal 178 cavity could explain the high transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 and HCoV-NL63, a cold-related 179 coronavirus, which also uses ACE2 as a receptor. One mystery is why SARS-CoV, which also 180 uses ACE2, was apparently unable to easily transmit from human-to-human (26). Whether this 181 represents differences in the interactions of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 with co-receptors (27) 182 or other factors in the nasal cavity remains to be investigated. SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 183 both replicate in the lungs (28, 29), consistent with the ACE2 distribution defined in this and 184 suggested by previous studies (9, 10). Most of the ACE2 expression in the lung was found in 185 AT2 cells, which are targets for SARS-CoV (30) and presumably SARS-CoV-2 (29). Given that 186 AT2 cells are critical for surfactant protein production and serve as progenitor cells for the AT1 187 cells, damage to these cells could contribute to acute lung injury (31), which is a common feature 188 of severe COVID-19 (5). Infection of AT2 cells could disrupt epithelial integrity leading to 189 alveolar edema, and facilitate viral spread to other epithelial cells or to ACE2 + interstitial 190 cells/vessels for systemic virus dissemination, given that SARS-CoV-2 has been detected in 191 blood (32). Furthermore, cell-to-cell spread of coronaviruses after initial infection could also 192 occur via receptor-independent mechanisms related to the fusogenic properties of the S protein 193 (33).

In summary, we find that ACE2 protein has heterogeneous expression in the respiratory 212 tract with higher ACE2 detection in the sinonasal epithelium and AT2 cells that correlates with 213 putative sites for transmission and severe disease, respectively. The small subset of ACE2 + AT2 214 cells in the lung could be further studied to reveal factors regulating ACE2 expression and clarify 215 potential targets for antiviral therapies. 216",

Instead, we saw increased ACE2 detection 153 in children <10 years of age and in the small airways (bronchioles) of individuals without 154 chronic comorbidities in our cohort. We note that not finding changes in receptor expression for 155 SARS-CoV-2 is different from another severe coronavirus disease, MERS, where comorbidities 156 were observed to increase its receptor detection in respiratory tissues (20, 21). 157158 Given the unexpected heterogeneity in the lower respiratory tract, we also investigated 159 ACE2 in the upper respiratory tract. We studied ACE2 gene expression using publicly available 160 scRNA-seq data from nasal brushing and nasal turbinate samples(22)and observed ACE2 161 mRNA transcripts in 2-6% of epithelial cells (Supplemental Figure 4a-d). We then studied nasal 162 biopsy tissues and found that ACE2 protein was detected in all tissue samples and, when present, 163 was seen exclusively on the apical surface of ciliated cells. Distribution varied regionally based 164 on the characteristics of the epithelium, with rare detection in thicker ciliated pseudostratified 165 epithelium, and more abundant expression in thinner epithelium (Figures 4a-g). Thinner 166 epithelial height is recognized in specific regions including the floor of the nasal cavity, 167 meatuses, and paranasal sinuses (23). Both, epithelial heterogeneity and undefined biopsy sites in 168 sinonasal cavity, limited direct comparisons between scRNA-seq results and protein staining. 169Additionally, it is possible ACE2 protein cannot be detected in all cell types with ACE2 mRNA 170 due to low expression, rapid protein turnover, or post-transcriptional regulation. The sinonasal 171 cavity is an interface between the respiratory tract and the environment. High SARS-CoV-",

First, the potential 199 relationship between ACE2 in the respiratory tract and severe COVID-19 is likely complex. On 200 one hand, more receptor availability could enhance viral entry into cells and worsen disease 201 outcomes; alternatively, ACE2 may play a protective role in acute lung injury (35-37) and 202 therefore could improve disease outcomes. Our data would support the latter and implicate a 203 dualistic role for ACE2 as both a viral receptor and a protective agent in acute lung injury. 204 Additionally, ACE2 exists in cell-associated and soluble forms (38). It is possible that greater 205 ACE2 expression could result in increased soluble ACE2 in respiratory secretions where it might 206 act as a decoy receptor and reduce virus entry (1, 39). Second, other factors such as TMPRSS2 207 expression might be more important in regulating disease severity. TMPRSS2 on the apical 208 membrane of AT2 cells might facilitate SARS-CoV-2 entry when ACE2 is rare or even below 209 the limit of detection in this study. 210 211",

For the bronchial biopsy 296 sample, 82.4% of cells had less than 3,000 UMIs, so we lacked confidence in assigned cell types, 297 and thus results were not reported. 298For the lung parenchyma data, gene expression in alveolar type II cells for a single donor was 300 quantified by summing up gene counts for all alveolar type II cells and dividing by total UMIs 301 for all alveolar type II cells to get normalized counts, followed by rescaling the normalized 302Statistical analyses for group comparisons and tissue scoring data were performed using 306GraphPad Prism version 8 (GraphPad Software, La Jolla, CA USA). For group comparisons, 307 Mann Whitney U tests or T-tests were used for group comparisons as appropriate and Cochran-308 Armitage test for trend was used to compare ACE2 protein detection in different tissues. 309 Li W, Moore MJ, Vasilieva N, Sui J, Wong SK, Berne MA, Somasundaran M, Sullivan JL, Zeng G, Yuen KY, Chen RC, Tang CL, Wang T, Chen PY, Xiang J, Li SY, Wang 329 JL, Liang ZJ, Peng YX, Wei L, Liu Y, Hu YH, Peng P, Wang JM, Liu JY, Chen Z, Li G, 330 Zheng ZJ, Qiu SQ, Luo J, Ye CJ, Zhu SY, Zhong NS, China Medical Treatment Expert 331 Group for C.
