Patients' occupation, travel history within the past 14 days, household contact information, demographic characteristics, potential source of exposure, influenza vaccination history, current list of medications, past medical history, social history, and the use of preventive measures were determined.

We collected hospitalization data using patients' paper medical records. Available CT scans were reported by a radiologist and scored for severity and location of involvement. The final reports were reviewed by an infectious disease specialist and a pulmonologist.

Our findings are in concordance with previous studies, where hydroxychloroquine showed efficacy in disease outcome. 13, 14 Furthermore, Cao et al. concluded that lopinavir/ritonavir is not efficacious for COVID-19; however, the data was not assessed in relation to individual patient parameters. 15 Our regression model identified age as a determinant in responsiveness to lopinavir/ritonavir, with efficacy being related to younger ages. Age has been identified as an important determinant in the mortality from COVID-19, but we show that younger age is also a determinant in the responsiveness to anti-viral therapy with lopinavir/ritonavir. We also used the model to determine the efficacy of a combined azithromycin/hydroxychloroquine regimen and found that the combination was not significant in clinical outcomes. This is contrary to current protocols and a previous study. 16 The second most significant finding was symptom relapse in 40% of patients after discharge. The most common relapsed symptoms were cough (18.6%) and shortness of breath (18.6%). Six patients (8.6%) were readmitted to the hospital, and 3 patients (4.3%) died after discharge. This emphasizes the need for a close follow-up after symptom improvement. Lan et al. showed that certain patients could recover and test negative, only to test positive again. 17, 18 This phenomenon might underlie the symptom rebound in our patients and might indicate that patients are still a source of transmission after recovering from COVID-19.",
