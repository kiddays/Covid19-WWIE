In contrast, the results of our study showed that the absolute value of lymphocytes in children with SARS-CoV-2 was mostly normal with only 6% below the normal range. However, the published expert consensus of COVID-19 for children recommends that clinicians should take decreased lymphocyte counts as one of the diagnostic criteria for suspected cases [23] [24] . Based on the analysis of these 32 patients in our study, we suggested that using decreased lymphocyte counts for the diagnosis of COVID-19 in children may lead to missed diagnoses of suspected cases and cannot be recommended for diagnosis for children.
