SARS-CoV-2 is an enveloped, positive-sense single-stranded \u03b2-coronavirus with a large, complex RNA genome 2 . To hijack the host translation machinery for propagation, enzymes encoded by the genome of coronaviruses (CoVs) modify the 5'-end of virally encoded mRNAs by creating a cap 3 . 44 RNA capping in CoVs involves activities of several nonstructural proteins (nsps): nsp13, a bifunctional RNA/NTP triphosphatase (TPase) and helicase; nsp14, a bifunctional 3'\u00e05' mismatch exonuclease and mRNA cap guanine-N7 methyltransferase; nsp16, a ribose 2'-O methyltransferase; and an elusive guanylyl transferase 4-7 .",

            "text": "We co-purified full-length SARS CoV-2 nsp16 and nsp10 proteins as a complex from E. coli, 72 mixed with nucleoside drugs such as adenosine or 5'-methylthioadenosine and subjected to crystallization screenings (see Methods for details). We anticipated that these drugs may occupy the binding site of SAM due to common features of both, a purine ring plus ribose. Since nucleoside analogues exhibit antiviral activity [15] [16] [17] , a nsp16/nsp10/adenosine complex could then 76 serve as a starting point for medicinal chemistry and perhaps rapid translation. Next, we soaked these crystals with a cap analogue me7 GopppA1 representing the Cap-0 state of the RNA cap, the substrate of this complex. We determined the ternary structure of nsp16/nsp10 by molecular replacement using the SARS-CoV-1/SAM binary complex (PDB ID 3R24) 8 structure as a template 80 (Supplementary Table 1 ). The initial difference maps indicated electron densities of SAM and me7 GopppA1 cap in their respective binding pockets. Even though SAM was not included in cocrystallization or soaking experiments, its electron density was unambiguously identified in difference maps (Fig. 1, 2, Supplementary Fig. 2A) . This observation is consistent with the co-84 purification tendency of SAM during isolation from expression hosts, as seen previously with NS5 of ZIKA and VP39 of vaccinia virus cap 2'-O MTases 18, 19 . Unexpectedly, we observed electron density on the opposite face of nsp16, >25 \u00c5 away from the catalytic pocket that could fit adenosine (present in our crystallization mixture) reasonably well (Figure 1, Supplementary Fig.  2, 3) . Further examination showed that this adenosine-binding pocket was partially composed of amino acid residues unique to SARS-CoV-2 (Supplementary Fig. 1) Overall structure 92 Nsp16 adopts a canonical S-adenosyl methionine (SAM)-dependent methyltransferase (SAM-MTase) fold 20 with slight variations 8, 14 . Its protein sequence displays a sequential order of secondary structural element: \u2022\u03b21\u03b11\u03b12\u03b22\u03b13\u03b23\u03b24\u2022\u03b25\u03b26\u2022\u03b14\u03b27\u03b15\u03b28\u2022\u03b29\u03b16\u2022\u03b210\u2022\u03b17\u03b211\u03b212, wherein the '\u2022' denotes a 310-helix ( Fig. 1, Supplementary Fig. 1) . The nsp16 MTase fold consists of a 96 centrally located twisted \u03b2 sheet of eight strands flanked by two alpha-helices on one side and three helices on the other. The \u03b2 sheet displays a continuum of four antiparallel (\u03b21\u03b28\u03b29\u03b27) and four parallel (\u03b26\u03b22\u03b23\u03b24) \u03b2 strands. The cap analogue substrate is situated within the confluence of these two halves. Loops emanating from strands \u03b29, \u03b27, and \u03b26 form a deep groove in the 100 center to accommodate the RNA cap, whereas the methyl donor SAM is bound within a cavity formed by the loops originating from strands \u03b26 and \u03b22. The protein chain emerging from helix \u03b14 runs across this groove and folds into a subdomain (\u2022\u03b210\u2022\u03b17\u03b211\u03b212) that stabilizes the bottom portion of nsp16. The adenosine binding pocket is at the back of the catalytic pocket, ~ 25 \u00c5 away ( Fig. 1) .",

The widening of the pocket that results allows accommodation of the RNA cap substrate, and engages the N 7 -methyl guanosine base of Cap-0 ( me7 Go) in a deep groove formed by residues of gate loop 1 on one side and gate loop 2 on the 124 other ( Fig. 2A, B, D, F) .

These specific interactions with the positively charged N7 and the methyl moiety of the me7 Go base would confer substrate selectivity against the uncharged GopppA 4 . In gate loop 2, Asn138 rotates outward and the side chain of invariant Lys137 rotates ~180\u00ba inward and forms stabilizing electrostatic interactions with all 3 phosphates of the Cap-0 structure and the 3'-O of 136 the me7 Go ribose. Tyr30 and Lys137 form a partial enclosure to restrict the movement of the terminal residue ( me7 Go) of the RNA cap (Fig. 2B, D) . The backbone of gate loop 1 runs perpendicular to the purine ring of me7 Go such that the backbone amide of Leu27 forms a hydrogen bond with O6 of me7 Go to confer specificity for guanine. The ribose sugar of me7 Go is sandwiched by the sidechains of Lys137 and His174 in gate loop 2 (Fig. 2B, D) .

Our ternary complex has allowed us to examine the model in the presence of the Cap-0 substrate. The catalytic pocket adopts a conical shape where residues of the catalytic tetrad circle a water molecule at the 'bottom' of the cone, whereas the target atom (2'-O) of the A1 nucleotide resides at the 'tip' of the cone. In addition, two invariant asparagine residues -Asn43 and Asn198 -outside of the catalytic tetrad stabilize the water molecule and the 3'-end of the target nucleotide (A1) in the RNA cap, respectively. The methyl group of SAM is positioned 3 \u00c5 from the 2'-OH of A1, available for a direct in line attack from the 2'-OH (Fig. 2C, E) . Supporting this concept, nsp16/nsp10 showed robust 2'-O methyltransferase activity. We also observed marked reduction in activity when the initiating nucleotide (N1) was changed from the cognate adenine to non-cognate base guanine (Fig. 2G) . Similar observations 180 were made by previous biochemical studies 8 , but the structural basis of this base discrimination was not clear.

Two of the mutations A209C (\u03b29), and E276S (\u03b16) are not present in any other CoV strain, whereas S188A, is present in one human strain (HKU1), two avian strains (TCoV and IBV) and one mouse strain (MHV) (Fig. 3, Supplementary Fig. 3 ). At ~ 25 \u00c5 away, and on the back of the catalytic center, this ligand binding pocket does not present obvious characteristics 228 for adenine specificity such as an aspartic acid or asparagine residue, which would usually make a hydrogen bond with the N6 amino group of adenines. Nonetheless, it displays two similarities with the SAM binding pocket: the purine ring in both pockets resides in an acidic environment, and both pockets harbor a cysteine near N6 of the purine ring. In the SAM pocket, Cys115 is 4.1 232 \u00c5 from the N6 amino group and positioned at a ~ 64\u00ba angle between N1 and the C6 atoms of the adenine ring with respect to Cys115 (Fig. 2C ). An equivalent cysteine in the adenosine pocket, Cys209, resides at 3.5 \u00c5, and at a ~ 85\u00ba angle from the N6 of adenine. The purine ring of adenosine is further stabilized by stacking interactions with Trp198 and Thr58, and its 5' tail, while 236 exposed to solvent, interacts with Asn13 (Fig. 3A) . Thus, the lack of extensive interactions for adenosine suggests that this pocket is somewhat non-specific but can accommodate small molecules with a heterocyclic ring. Interestingly, a binary structure of SARS-CoV-2 nsp16 (PDB ID: 6W4H) shows a sugar moiety (\u03b2-D-fructopyranose) occupying the position of adenosine. In (Supplementary Fig. 4) . Thus, we propose that this distant region endows nsp16 with the unique ability to bind small molecules outside of .

A four amino acid long stretch (Met131 to Pro134) that corresponds to gate loop 2 intrudes into the SAM and cap binding pockets and separates the two purine rings of SAM and A1 (the target adenine) by ~10 \u00c5. This separation favorably orients the ribose sugar of A1 and the donor methyl group of SAM for 2'-O methylation. The carboxy end of SAM is stabilized by 164 charged interactions from the side chains of Asn43 and Tyr47 and the backbone amide of Gly81(Fig. 2C).",

Thus, Lys170 likely acts as a general base during 2'-O methyl transfer in SARS-CoV-2. One possible role of the water molecule is that it co-operates with Asp130 to transiently stabilize the transfer of the positively charged methyl group from SAM to 2'-O of A1 base. We propose that 204 once occupied by SAM, the catalytic pocket is primed for A1 base binding and catalysis. This may be a general mechanism for 2'-O methylation for all coronaviruses. Although all components required for methylation are present in our crystals, we have not observed methylation of 2'-OH, possibly due to a requirement for additional RNA sequence downstream of the target A1 base 8 .",
