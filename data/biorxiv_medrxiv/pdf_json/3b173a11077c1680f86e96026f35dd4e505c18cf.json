The estimation procedure projects the observed numbers of confirmed cases to numbers previously infected, where the number of confirmed cases in each time interval follows a multinomial distribution with cell probabilities that can be expressed as a convolution of the density of the infection time and the distribution of time to diagnosis. As a result, the problem is reduced to estimating the size of a multinomial population. This approach has been applied to study infectious diseases such as acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) and bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) epidemic. (7, 8) Although the method can not predict future new infections, it provides a lower bound estimate for the number of confirmed cases in the near future to guide decision making on medical resource allocation.",

To implement the maximum likelihood estimation, we assume that F u (t; \u03b2) \u2261 F (t; \u03b2), that is, the time from infection to diagnosis is independent of the date when the individual was infected. This assumption may not be valid for the confirmed case in Wuhan or other cities in the Hubei province, as the medical resource in the early stage of the epidemic is extremely scarce and thus it may take a long time for infected individuals to be diagnosed. In fact, the surge in the number of confirmed cases in China on February 13 was due to a new diagnosis classification rule for cases in the Hubei province; the RT-PCR test for COVID-19 was not available for many of the previously infected individuals despite having symptoms of pneumonia. On the other hand, this assumption seems reasonable for areas outside of Hubei province as the healthcare system has not been overly stressed.",

Hence a different set of random variables T * = T \u2212\u03b4 and U * = U +\u03b4 yield the same distribution as T + U . On the other hand, although the location shift factor \u03b4 can not be estimated directly from the observed data, we can assess the magnitude of the location shift by comparing the estimated time to diagnosis distribution to what reported in the existing literature. Note that, under location shift, the relative difference in time between two landmark time points, such as the peak and lowest point in the infection density or last week compared to this week, can be estimated from the data.",

The difference between the expected and observed cumulative number of confirmed cases gives the near-term prediction of additional cases to be diagnosed. Since the prediction is relatively unstable for the first few weeks of the epidemic due to the limited amount of data, we only perform prediction after February 10, that is, the fourth week into the epidemic.

Among all countries, China has imposed the most sweeping restrictions in response to COVID-19. The authorities locked down cities, restricted movements of millions and suspended business operations to prevent further outbreak of the disease. South Korea, another country on the front-line of the epidemic, adopted the \"test and trace\" strategy to aggressively test people for the disease and quarantine those who tested positive, so that the rest of the population can go about their daily lives. Both countries have observed a significant decline in the number of confirmed cases. However, to the best of our knowledge, no formal quantitative evaluation of the effect of these aggressive control measures on the incidence of infection has been conducted. This research aims to provide some preliminary evidence on the effectiveness of these measures by analyzing data from China outside of the Hubei province. We conclude that the extreme measures undertaken by the Chinese government have effectively slowed down the spread of the disease outside of the Hubei province in about two weeks. We also demonstrate that the back-calculation algorithm can be used to estimate the number of infected individuals to be diagnosed in the near future. This provides a useful utility to guide the planning of medical resource allocation in the middle of the epidemic.",

The Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (China CDC) reported a novel coronavirus as the causative agent of this outbreak on January 9, 2020. To contain the spread of the virus, Wuhan, the epicenter of the coronavirus epidemic, has been placed in lockdown since January 23, 2020. The order was later expanded to the entire Hubei province in the next few days, affecting nearly 56 million people. However, it was estimated that 5 million people already left the central Chinese city, as China's great Lunar New Year migration has already broken across the nation in the first few weeks of January. Some carried with them the new virus that has since spread throughout China and to 212 other countries, claiming almost 89,000 lives and sickening more than 1,400,000 people as of April 10, 2020. After characterizing the outbreak a Public Health Emergency of International Concern in late January, the World Health Organization (WHO) eventually declared COVID-19 as a pandemic on March 11, 2020.",

We analyze data from areas outside the Hubei Province during the 8-week period between January 20 and March 15. Note that March 15 was selected because the majority of the newly confirmed cases have been imported cases afterwards. The daily numbers of confirmed cases are graphically depicted in Figure 2A. It can be observed that the daily number of confirmed cases reached its peak on February 15 with 890 new cases, 11 days after the lockdown of Wuhan City on January 23. The spike of 261 new cases on February 20 was due to delayed reports of outbreaks in two prisons.",

The expected numbers of new cases under the fitted model are shown in Figure 2A. The predicted numbers track well with the observed data, suggesting that the proposed model fits well. The maximum likelihood estimates of the shape and size parameters for the Weibull distribution are 1.03 (SE 0.004) and 5.39 (SE 0.17), respectively.This corresponds to a median of 3.8 days (SE 0.12). As discussed before, the distribution of the time to diagnosis is estimated subject to a location shift. Recently,[9] analyzed the length-biased incubation time from 1211 confirmed COVID-19 cases who left Wuhan before the lockdown and reported a median incubation period of 8.13 days (95% CI 7.37-8.91).This suggests a location shift factor of about 5 days in our estimates.What's also of interest is the estimate of incidence density after the lockdown of Wuhan.The maximum likelihood estimates for a j 's in the 9 selected time intervals, including the time interval preceding January 20, are (2.56 \u00d7 10 \u22125 , 5.03 \u00d7 10 \u22122 , 7.34 \u00d7 10 \u22122 , 1.74 \u00d7 10 \u22122 , 7.72 \u00d7 10 \u221212 , 3.55 \u00d7 10 \u221214 , 6.75 \u00d7 10 \u22125 , 7.92 \u00d7 10 \u22124 , 9.05 \u00d7 10 \u22124 ) with standard errors (1.08\u00d710 \u22125 , 1.53\u00d710 \u22123 , 1.29\u00d710 \u22123 , 1.40\u00d710 \u22123 , 4.93\u00d710 \u22124 , 1.07\u00d710 \u221211 , 1.21\u00d710 \u22124 , 1.77\u00d7 10 \u22124 , 2.64\u00d710 \u22124 ). By definition, these estimates are for infected individuals who have been or will be diagnosed. Since the number of diagnosed individuals is proportional to the total number of infected (including those who were asymptomatic), the values provide estimates of relative risk among all infected individuals. After accounting for a location shift factor of 5 days, the peak of infection occurred immediately after the lockdown of Wuhan city (",
