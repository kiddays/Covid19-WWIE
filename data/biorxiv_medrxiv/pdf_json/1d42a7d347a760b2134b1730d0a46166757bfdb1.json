The aim of this study was to document the neutral and adaptive variation of 24 populations among anadromous Arctic Char in Nunavik and bordering regions. We used GBS to 25 genotype 20,327 filtered single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) for 650 individuals sampled in 26 23 locations along >2,000 km of coastline. Our results reveal a hierarchical genetic structure, 27 whereby neighboring hydrographic systems harbour distinct populations grouping within major 28 oceanographic basins, namely the Hudson Bay, Hudson Strait, Ungava Bay and Labrador Sea. We 29 found genetic diversity and differentiation to be influenced by both post-glacial recolonization 30 history and by patterns of isolation-by-distance reflecting contemporary gene flow. Furthermore, 31 using three gene-environment association (GEA) methods we found genomic evidence for local 32 adaptation to both freshwater and marine habitats, especially in relation to sea-surface and air 33 temperatures during summer, precipitation, and salinity. This study is among the first to explicitly 34 explore the genetic basis of marine adaptations in salmonids and highlights the complex 35 interactions in selective pressures over the lifespan of anadromous fishes. 36",

However, those 432 pairs of populations only deviated from IBD patterns when we restricted analyses to sampling 433 sites around the Hudson Strait area. In other words, the effect of Hudson Strait as a barrier to 434 gene flow could only be observed at a regional scale. Differentiation between populations 435 separated by the Hudson Strait was lower than, for example, pairwise FST between populations 436 in western and eastern Ungava Bay, despite those populations being connected by a near-shore 437 migration route. We cannot exclude the possibility of other barriers to gene flow in our study 438 area, as inhospitable coastal habitats have been found to act as barriers to migration along the 439 shore in anadromous Brown Trout (Salmo trutta; Qu\u00e9m\u00e9r\u00e9 et al., 2015) .

Moreover, many studies showed that landlocked Arctic Char 510 populations, which lost access to the sea since their recolonization of freshwater habitat, have 511 lost the ability to tolerate seawater (e.g: Eliassen et al., 1998; Bystriansky et al., 2007) .

However, the freshwater environmental 516 factors used in our study are catchment-based and could limit our interpretations. This is due to 517 sampling having been carried out during the upstream migration, which prevents us from 518 knowing the precise spawning site or overwintering lake used by the sampled individuals. In 519 marine systems, genomic evidence for local adaptation and isolation-by-environment has been 520 found both at local scales in heterogeneous habitats (e.g. Lenhert et al., 2019; Miller et al., 2019) 521 and over large geographic distances (e.g. Clucas, Lou, Therkildsen & Kovach, 2019). Arctic Char is 522 expected to use preferred habitats based on temperature, salinity, and prey availability (Spares 523 et al., 2012 (Spares 523 et al., , 2015 Harris et al. 2020 ).
