The most effective experimental therapy against the EBOV is the use of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs). In this work, we describe the development of HEK293T cells engineered for the transient and stable expression of mAb13C6, a neutralizing anti-EBOV monoclonal antibody. We transfected the HEK293T cells with a tricistronic vector to produce the heavy and the light chain of the antibody 13C6 and intracellular Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP) using Lipofectamine 3000. We then selected the transfected cells using puromycin pressure, dilution cloning, and cloning disks. This integrated strategy generated mAb-producing cells in 7 days with a transient expression of ~1 mg/L. Stable pools were produced after 4 weeks, with expression levels of ~0.8 mg/L. Stable clones with expression levels of ~1.8 mg/L were obtained within 10 weeks. The produced antibodies exhibited the expected functionality; they recognized the GP glycoprotein of the Ebola virus in both ELISA assays and cell binding experiments . : bioRxiv preprint using HEK293T cells engineered to express the EBOV GP at their membrane surface. By the combined use of GFP and the set of selection techniques here described, we drastically reduced the time from transfection to stable clone generation without resorting to costly equipment. In outbreaks or emergencies, this platform can significantly shorten the development of new biopharmaceuticals and vaccines.",

As stated before, the generation of stable cultures of mammalian cells as producers of monoclonal antibodies is technically cumbersome and lengthy. 27 Studies related to the development of stable cells typically report a timeline in the range of 6 to 12 months and involve multiple steps of pressure/selection. 27 New techniques for the generation of stable cell lines have reduced the timeline, but these generally involve the use of costly equipment, such as flow cytometers capable of sorting or automated colony picking (i.e., CloniPix FL). [39] [40] [41] [42] We produced a stable cell pool in less than 5 weeks and stable clones in 10 weeks using the methods described here. We extended the expression and improved antibody production using puromycin to kill low-producer cells and to select for stable pools and clones of highproducer cells (Figure 2A) . We first established a puromycin kill curve in the range of concentrations from 0.25-10 \u00b5g mL -1 ( Figure 2B) . We obtained the highest fraction of transfected cells and post/treatment viability using a concentration of puromycin between 0.4 and 0.8 \u00b5g mL -1 .

Continuous monitoring of the glucose concentration allowed us to confirm that cells were metabolically active and that sufficient substrate was still available to sustain viability and mAb13C6 production. The GFP expression was also used as a reporter in our experiments to monitor the viability and overall condition of the cultures. We closely monitored the status of our cultures by visual inspection under fluorescent illumination with an optical microscope ( Figure 3C ). As before, we determined the concentration of mAb13C6 using ELISA. We observed sustained concentration levels of approximately 0.8 mg of IgG L -1 during the last 5 days of stable pool cultures from final cell counts of 1.5 \u00d7 10 6 cells in volumes of 15 mL ( Figure   3B ). For reference, these values imply specific cell productivities of approximately 1.6 +/-0.04 pg cell -1 day -1 , or one order of magnitude below those reported for stable and high producer CHO cell clones in typical commercial processes. 43 We used our stable pool cultures to conduct dilution cloning, and we cultured the clones for an additional week to expand the clones. We then used cloning discs to single out clones, and we grew them in new and independent wells for 1 to 2 weeks before scaling the culture from 24-well to 6-well plates. This strategy allowed us to obtain stable clones after approximately 10 weeks. From the stable pools of mAb13C6 producers, we selected 4 high-expression clones, designated as C66, C95, C96, and C97, for further characterization. Selection was based on the level of fluorescence emitted by the cultures of stable pools, as observed and measured by optical microscopy. As expected, we observed higher production of mAb13C6 in the stable clone cultures than in the stable pools. The selected .

We constructed a plasmid (referred to here as CMV-GP-RFP) that drives the expression of a GP protein from EBOV fused with red fluorescent protein (RFP). Using this plasmid, we engineered a batch of HEK293T cells that transiently expressed GP-RFP at their cell surface ( Figure 5B ). Pools of these cells, expressing GP at their surface, were then used for visual evaluation of the proper binding of mAb13C6 to the GP from Ebola. Adherent cultures of GP-RFP HEK293T cells were exposed to supernatant from cultures of mAb13C6 producers and spontaneous binding was allowed to progress for 30 min. After washing repeated times with PBS to remove unbounded mAb units, an anti-IgG conjugated with FITC was added for visual revelation of the presence of the GP-mAb13C6 complex by fluorescence microscopy ( Figure 5C ). We observed the expected merging of red and green, from GP and FITC, respectively ( Figure 5C ), in 2-D cultures of our stable clones (C66, C95, C96, and C97). These results suggest that mAb13C6, produced by our stable clones, is biologically functional, as it recognizes and specifically binds GP-EBOV displayed in cell membranes of engineered HEK293T cells.",

We demonstrated the production of anti-EBOV mAbs in HEK293T cell line with activity to recognize the GP protein, in transient, stable pool, and stable clone cultures. Our transient expression cultures produced approximately 1 mg/L of mAb13C6 in a week using standard adherent cell culture techniques alone. Our further use of cost-effective selection methods that translate readily to conventional cell culture labs enabled the development of stable pools and ultimately stable clones, thereby improving the antibody production to as much as 1.8 mg/L, with specific cell productivities of 5.33 +/-0.7 pg cell -1 day -1 in our four highproduction selected clones. These specific productivity values are competitive with or higher than those previously reported for stable HEK cells, albeit still far away from the productivities needed for a commercial mAb process. 43 Further optimization is expected from adaptation of the clones to suspended culture conditions and development of perfusion feeding protocols. These two optimization stages frequently result in a titer enhancement of at least two orders of magnitude 48 . The methodologies presented here can be directly generalized to any other mAb and easily adapted to any other glycosylated protein. In the current context of pandemic COVID-19, the urgency of the abbreviation of the process to develop stable clones is more evident than ever. 52, 53 Our response capabilities have been cruelly challenge by COVID-19. Shortening the path for developing vaccines and neutralizing monoclonal antibodies will greatly benefit our societies.",

We extracted the antibody gene from pCMV-13C6 vector using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) strategies. To this aim, we used Phusion Green Hot Start II High-Fidelity PCR Master Mix (Thermo Scientific, MA, USA; Cat. No. F566L). Ligation was done using the restriction enzyme SapI in the bicistronic vector pCMV-2A-GFP from ATUM (CA, US).

Transient expression enables the production of recombinant protein within only days after transfection, yielding production levels that are often sufficient for characterization and preclinical studies. 27,31-34 The transfection technique used, in conjunction with the selection of an adequate expression vector (i.e., expression in transient or stable format), are the fundamental factors that determine the success of any strategy aimed at achieving high production of a recombinant protein 27 . Different methods have been reported for transfection of the HEK293 cell line, including the use of polyethylenimine (PEI), electroporation, use of dendrimers, and calcium phosphate precipitation. 23,35-38 Here, we transfected the CMV-13C6-2A-GFP plasmid using Lipofectamine 3000. Image analysis techniques were used to determine the efficiency of transfection based on microscopy images. The same field of view was first captured under bright field and then under fluorescence illumination. Transfection efficiencies were determined from these pairs of images as the percentage of cells expressing GFP 3 h after transfection. We achieved high efficiencies of transfection (over 80%) in HEK293T cells using this strategy. The conditions and protocols reported here yielded transient cultures 48 h post-transfection. We determined the concentration of mAb13C6 produced in our transient cultures using ELISA experiments that allowed evaluation of the total concentration of IgGs in the supernatant of transiently expressing HEK293T cells cultured in flasks. For instance, in our experiments, we obtained several milligrams of mAb13C6 at 3 days after transfection (Figure 3A). In our transient cultures, we observed levels of expression of ~1 mg/L in cultures containing a total of 3 \u00d7 10 5 cells between the 4th and 7th day in a volume of 2 mL (in 6 well-plates) (Figure 3A).

The stable pool cultures depleted glucose from the culture medium in about 20 days, whereas the high-producer clones consumed all the glucose in only 7 days. As before, GFP expression was used as a reporter for monitoring the cultures and guiding the selection process. Micrographs of the culture progression with time are shown inFigure 4B.
