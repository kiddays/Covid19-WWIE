            "text": "In December 2019, SARS-CoV-2, the etiological agent of Coronavirus Disease 2019 18 (COVID-19), emerged in Wuhan, China. Since then it has rapidly spread to the rest of the world 19 (1-3). As of April 16, 2020, there have been 1,991,562 confirmed cases, including 130,885 20 deaths, in 185 countries or regions (4). 21 Initial sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 showed limited genetic variation between cases, but 22 did document specific changes that may be useful for understanding the source and transmission 23 chains (5-8). Because SARS-CoV-2 has shown the capacity to spread rapidly and lead to a range 24 of presentations in infected persons, from asymptomatic infection to mild, severe, or fatal 25 disease, it is important to identify genetic variants in order to understand any changes in 26 transmissibility, tropism, and pathogenicity. Sequence data can be used to inform decisions to 27 better manage the spread of disease. 28 In this report, we describe the design and use of two PCR-based methods for sequencing 29 SARS-CoV-2 clinical specimens. The first is a multiplex PCR panel followed by sequencing on On January 10, 2020, the first SARS-CoV-2 genome sequence was released online (11).",
