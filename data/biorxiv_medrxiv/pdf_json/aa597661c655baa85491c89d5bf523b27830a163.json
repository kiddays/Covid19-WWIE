It is of our interest to note that there are two major clusters-Asian cluster represented by purple and related colours and European cluster represented by greenish yellow. The Indian samples, represented by arrows (black and white) cluster with both Asian cluster and European clusters.

S clade is characterized by the presence of L84S in ORF8 and mostly comprises sequences from North America. Recently, a new clade of SARS-CoV-2 carrying V378I in ORF1ab has been linked to travellers returning from Iran to Australia (Eden et al., 2020) . We then investigated the genomes of Indian SARS-CoV-2 viruses to find out the association between Indian samples and different clades. This analysis revealed several interesting facts (Figure 3) . We found Indian samples does not belong to either clade V or S except the sample EPI-ISL_413522, which is one of samples derived from patient with recent travel history from Wuhan. The other Indian sample (EPI_ISL_413523) who also had travel history from Wuhan does not seem to belong to any of these clades suggesting that this virus may be more similar to original Wuhan-China virus. However, the origin of these two viral isolates needs to more investigation. Most Indian samples are found to classify between G and I clades. One set of thirteen Indian samples .

Another set of thirteen Indian samples (n=13) that belong to the cluster A, which are enriched with Oceania samples as per figure 2, segregate into I clade as they carry V378I mutation in ORF1ab gene. We have also extended our viral clade analysis to recently submitted Indian samples (n=9) from the state of Karnataka. Due to the fact that these samples are low coverage samples, they could not be included in phylogenetic analysis. However, clade analysis revealed three samples from this Karnataka set belongs to G clade, while the status of other samples could not be clearly established (Supplementary figure 3) . We conclude from this analysis that Indian samples are divided between I and G clades. Thus, these results provide additional confirmation to our earlier findings (as per figure 2) that while one set of Indian samples in cluster A is more similar to Oceania samples, the other set of Indian samples in cluster B is more similar to European samples.",

It has been reported that viruses belonging to different clades may differ in their virulence (Brusky, 2020) . For example, the G clade viruses carry glycine (G) corresponding to the codon 614 of S protein instead of aspartic acid (D) in other clades. Phylogenetic analysis identified that D614G mutation is originated from ancestral D residue seen in the reference Wuhan virus (Wu et al., 2020) . This residue is located very close to glycosylation region of the viral spike protein encoded by S gene (Anderson et al., 2020) . It has been proposed that mutations in and around glycosylation region may alter viral spike protein structure and hence the membrane fusion process resulting in varied pathogenicity and transmissibility. Further, the difference in the death rate of COVID-19 patients of East Coast Vs. West Coast of USA is implicated to their difference in their G .

The cluster B consists mostly of European and few numbers of Middle East/South Asian sample besides a large number of Indian samples (n=13). The analysis revealed that most Indian SARS-CoV-2 viruses (26 out of 28) show more similarity to that of specific countries. In cluster A, Indian samples show more similarity to the viruses found in Oceania/Kuwait samples, while in the cluster B, Indian samples show more similarity to mainly European and few numbers of Middle East/South Asian samples. These results indicate that majority of Indian SARS-CoV-2 viruses have originated from Europe, Middle East, South Asia and Oceania regions. Besides these two sets of Indian SARS-CoV-2 viruses, there are two more Indian isolates (EPI_ISL_413522 and EPI_ISL_413523) which are not present in clusters A and B; these two isolates are present in other clusters which contained most samples from China and East Asia.
