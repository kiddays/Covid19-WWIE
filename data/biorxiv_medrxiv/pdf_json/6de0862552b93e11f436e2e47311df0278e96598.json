We estimated the speed with which these measures contained community transmission in each of 58 Chinese cities. On average, containment was achieved 7.83 days (SD 6.79 days) after the implementation of social distancing interventions, with an average reduction in the reproduction number ( R t ) of 54.3% (SD 17.6%) over that time period. A single day delay in the implementation of social distancing led to a 2.41 (95% CI: 0.97, 3.86) day delay in containment. Swift social distancing interventions may thus achieve rapid containment of newly emerging COVID-19 outbreaks.",

Its etiology was later identified as the novel SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus. The disease (COVID-19) spread rapidly across China and internationally 1 . As of April 9, 2020, there have been 1,436,198 confirmed cases and 85,522 deaths in 209 countries 2 . In the absence of pharmaceutical prophylactic options, the primary means of COVID-19 control are social distancing interventions, including school closures, work restrictions, shelter-in-place measures and travel bans. In late January, reported cases rose steeply in the Hubei province of China and imported cases sparked outbreaks in many other cities throughout China. By February 14, 2020, the government had limited the movement of over 500 million people across 80 cities 3, 4 . During this time, many of these cities rapidly enacted multiple social distancing orders to slow the local spread of the virus, such as restricting non-essential services and public transit [5] [6] [7] [8] . Given the substantial economic and societal costs of such measures 9 , estimates of their effectiveness can serve as critical evidence for intervention policy decisions worldwide 10, 11 .",

Technically, we consider an outbreak contained when the 95% confidence interval of the instantaneous reproduction number ( R t ) drops below one. We analyzed the speed of COVID-19 containment for 58 cities in Mainland China outside of Hebei Province with at least 20 confirmed cases by February 14, 2020 ( Figure 1 and Appendix Table S2 ). Collectively, these cities deployed seven different types of interventions over the course of their epidemics 12 : (1) bans on entertainment and public gatherings; (2) broad restrictions on public service including healthcare, schooling, shopping and restaurants; (3) initiation of a level-1 response entailing systematic testing and isolation of confirmed cases; (4) suspension of intra-city public transport; (5) suspension of travel between cities; (6) reporting of confirmed cases; (7) recruitment of governmental staff and volunteers to enforce quarantine and social distancing. On average, the first social distancing measure was enacted 13 days (95% CI: 3, 22.05) following the first confirmed case. At the time of the first measure, the 58 cities had an average of 40 (95% CI: 9, 209) cumulative reported cases. The cities achieved containment an average of 21 days (95% CI: 7.95, 35.1) after the first reported case and 11.5 days (95% CI: -5.1, 25.2) following implementation of the earliest interventions. During the period of containment, the reproduction number ( R t ) declined by an average of 54.3% (SD 17.6%) ( Appendix Figure S2 ).",

A delay of a single day in implementing the first intervention is expected to prolong an outbreak by 2.41 (95% CI: 0.96, 3.86) days. In contrast, the timing of the level-1 response was inversely related to the speed of containment. Level-1 responses were initiated by the central government across Mainland China over the course of one week, starting with the hardest hit areas in and near Hubei Province on the first day and working outwards towards more distant cities. Thus, the day of Level-1 initiation within this one-week period is likely an indicator for the initial severity of an outbreak and the corresponding difficulty of containment.",
