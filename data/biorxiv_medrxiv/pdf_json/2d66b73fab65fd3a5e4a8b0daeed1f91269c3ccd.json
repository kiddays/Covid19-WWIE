In each subpopulation, representing a locality, disease propagates according to a modified susceptible-exposedinfected-recovered (SEIR) dynamics. We assume that individuals reduce their number of contacts as a function of the weighted sum of cumulative number of cases within the locality and in neighboring localities. The susceptible and exposed (pre-symptomatic and infectious) individuals are allowed to travel between localities undetected. To investigate the combined effects of mobility and contact reduction on disease progression within interconnected localities, we consider a scenario with two localities where disease originates in one and is exported to the neighboring locality via travel of undetected pre-symptomatic individuals. We associate the behavior change at the disease-importing locality due to the outbreak size at the origin with the level of preparedness of the locality. Our results show that restricting mobility is valuable if the importing locality is increasing its level of preparedness with respect to the outbreak size at the origin. Moreover, increased levels of preparedness can yield lower total outbreak size by further reducing the outbreak size at the importing locality, even when the response at the origin is weak. Our results highlight that public health decisions on social distancing at localities with less severe outbreaks should strongly account for potential impact of neighbouring localities with a poor response to the outbreak rather than localities with successful responses.",

Recent experiments on temporal viral shedding of COVID-19 estimate near half of the secondary cases happen by being in contact with individuals in pre-symptomatic stage [13] .

In addition, behavior in a locality can be affected by the disease severity in neighboring localities. That is, individuals in a locality take protective measures, e.g., social distancing, based on disease severity in a neighboring locality. In particular, we consider a scenario between two localities in which the disease originates in one, and moves to the other locality by mobility of exposed individuals. In this scenario, we interpret initial behavior changes at the locality neighboring the origin as 'preparedness-based' behavior change. Our aim is to quantify the combined effects of inter-locality mobility, preparedness-based behavior change, and behavior changes in response to local disease prevalence. Our analysis focuses on delay in peak times between two localities, total outbreak size and the outbreak size at localities neighboring the origin as a function of mobility, preparedness, and population response.",

It determines the overall distancing at locality i based on the awareness. If \u03b1 i = 0, there is no distancing response to the awareness at locality i.

We refer to the case with \u03b1 i = 1 as the linear distancing model. In the following, we consider two localities with equal population sizes N 1 = N 2 .

The difference in peak times of two localities increases from 19 days to 31 days as \u03bb ij decreases from 0.01% to 0.0001%. Next, we consider the effect of social distancing. For this, we assume localities only put weight on disease prevalence at their own locality, i.e., \u03c9 ii = 1 for i \u2208 {1, 2}. Figure 1 (Right) shows the reduction in final outbreak size and peak ratio of infected at Locality 2 as localities become more responsive, i.e., as \u03b1 i increases. When the distancing is linear \u03b1 i = 1, the reductions in peak and outbreak size are slightly above 20%. Reduction in both metrics reaches above 60% when \u03b1 i = 5. While both metrics continue to decrease with \u03b1 i increasing, there does not exist a critical threshold of \u03b1 i that stops the outbreak from happening [15] [16] [17] . We observe a slight decrease in time of peak from day 37 to day 35 as \u03b1 i increases from 0 to 5. The results mentioned above for Locality 2 are very similar for Locality 1 which observes the outbreak on average 19 days earlier.

Our analysis showed that it is beneficial to reduce travel between localities given the inability to detect asymptomatic infectious individuals (consistent with recent findings [1] ). However, this benefit is contingent on how prepared neighboring localities are for the importation of cases. We used the term adopted awareness to determine the level of preparedness at neighboring localities as an increasing function of the outbreak size at the origin. The increasing function assumption implied that neighboring localities increase their levels of preparedness as the severity of the disease at the origin increased. That is, as the severity of the outbreak at the origin increases, this triggers increased social distancing efforts at neighboring localities by local authorities making non-pharmaceutical interventions, e.g., declaring state of emergency, or issuing stay at home orders. Our analysis showed that slow mobility will provide the lead time for increased alertness levels and will result in higher levels of preparedness. Indeed, low mobility reduces the critical level of preparedness needed to stop the outbreak from becoming a pandemic at a neighboring locality (Figure 2) .",
