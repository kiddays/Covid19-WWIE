R0 is a widely used indicator of transmission potential in a totally susceptible population and is driven by the average contact rate and the mean infectious period of the disease (1). Yet, it only characterizes transmission potential at the onset of the epidemic and varies geographically for a given infectious disease according to local healthcare provision, outbreak response, as well as socioeconomic and cultural factors. Furthermore, estimating R0 requires information about the natural history of the infectious disease. Thus, our ability to estimate reproduction numbers for novel infectious diseases is hindered by the paucity of information about their epidemiological characteristics and transmission mechanisms. More informative metrics could synthesize real-time information about the extent to which the epidemic is expanding over time. Such metrics would be particularly useful if they rely on minimal data on the outbreak's trajectory (2) . Data sources.

Main analysis: The harmonic mean of the arithmetic means of COVID-19 epidemic doubling times (red circle) with 95% confidence interval (red bar) of the doubling times (days), and their values (black diamond) by the number of times the reported cumulative incidence doubles by province within mainland China from January 20, 2020 through February 9, 2020. Each panel represents a province except the panel representing \"Mainland China (except Hubei)\" that is the aggregate of all other provinces in mainland China, except Hubei. Doubling time for Tibet is not available, because there had only been 1 confirmed case in Tibet as of February 9, 2020. .
