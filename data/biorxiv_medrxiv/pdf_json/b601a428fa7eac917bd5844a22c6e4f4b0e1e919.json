            "text": "Coronavirus 2019 , caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, has become the 86 deadliest pandemic in modern history, reaching nearly every country worldwide and 87 overwhelming healthcare institutions. As of April 20, there have been more than 2.4 88 million confirmed cases with over 160,000 deaths. Extreme case surges coupled with 89 challenges in forecasting the clinical course of affected patients have necessitated 90 thoughtful resource allocation and early identification of high-risk patients. However, 91 effective methods for achieving this are lacking. In this paper, we use electronic health 92 records from over 3,055 New York City confirmed COVID-19 positive patients across 93 five hospitals in the Mount Sinai Health System and present a decision tree-based 94 machine learning model for predicting in-hospital mortality and critical events. This 95 model is first trained on patients from a single hospital and then externally validated on 96 patients from four other hospitals. We achieve strong performance, notably predicting 97 mortality at 1 week with an AUC-ROC of 0.84. Finally, we establish model 98 interpretability by calculating SHAP scores to identify decisive features, including age, 99 inflammatory markers (procalcitonin and LDH), and coagulation parameters (PT, PTT, 100 D-Dimer). To our knowledge, this is one of the first models with external validation to 101 both predict outcomes in COVID-19 patients with strong validation performance and 102 identify key contributors in outcome prediction that may assist clinicians in making 103 effective patient management decisions.",

As a control, both simple and generalized additive logistic regression 149 models were trained to assess performance, given their ubiquity as the preferred model 150 in current COVID research pieces. 151 152 After training, the classifier robustly predicted the presence of a critical event at three, 153 five, seven, and 10 days (Figure 2 and Supplementary Table 4) as measured by area 154 under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC-ROC = 0.74 for OH, 0.83 for 155 MSH at 1 week) and area under the precision-recall curve (AUPRC = 0.58 for OH, 0.49 156 for MSH at 1 week).

With respect to mortality, the model achieved high specificity (0.79 -162 0.92 for OH) and AUC-ROC (0.79 -0.92 for OH) with similar AUPRC (0.38 -0.65 OH) 163 as with critical events. As the event time window increased, the performance of the 164 classifier by the AUPRC value improved, which likely stems from the infrequency of 165 deaths at earlier time points that created a class imbalance for mortality. Comparatively, 166 all logistic regression models underperformed significantly in prediction by AUC-ROC 167 (0.61-0.70) and AUC-PRC (0.06 -0.18) for mortality. 168 169 Identifying important features in the model 170 To identify the most salient features driving model prediction, SHAP (SHapley Additive 171 exPlanations) values(6) were calculated for the highest-performing model in the cross-172 validation set during hyperparameter tuning (Figure 3). Among the top features, both 173 high and low levels of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), procalcitonin, and D-dimer were 174 strong drivers for predicting a critical event at 1 week, while elevated prothrombin time 175 (PT) and partial thromboplastin time (PTT) favored the classifier to predict a critical 176 event. For mortality, both high and low values for age, procalcitonin, and red blood cell 177 distribution width (RDW) were the strongest effectors in guiding mortality prediction by 178 the model within 1 week of admission.

The 192 model's high specificity, particularly for mortality at days three (specificity = 0.92) and 193 five (specificity = 0.86), suggest its role for augmenting clinicians' decision-making when 194 identifying patients at immediate risk of impending clinical decompensation and 195 potentially guide allocation of more intensive care upon admission. 196 197 Additionally, our framework permits a clinically relevant understanding of the model's 198 most salient features defining its decision boundaries. Age was the most important 199 feature for mortality prediction in COVID-19+ patients, with a notable exponential rise of 200 feature contribution as age increased (Figure 3)(7, 8). Elevations in serum LDH, 201 although nonspecific markers of inflammation, are implicated in pulmonary endothelial 202 cell injury and in COVID-19+ patients(9-11). Equivalently, procalcitonin has been 203 implicated as a biomarker of underlying infection and sepsis risk(12, 13). Elevated 204 RDW, which may be an index for enhanced patient frailty and risk of adverse 205 outcomes(14), was also a strong driver of mortality. Other salient features like 206 leukocytosis(15), a natural response to inflammation, in combination with virally-driven 207 lymphopenia(16, 17), have also been associated with COVID-19 burden. Additionally, 208 elevated troponins(18, 19), renal dysfunction from elevated creatinine(20), anemia, vital 209 instability (low oxygen saturation, tachycardia, hypotension), elevated ferritin(10, 19), 210 high lactate, and acidosis were also contributors to driving model prediction towards 211 mortality. With growing evidence of COVID-19-induced hypercoagulable states in these 212 patients(10, 21, 22), it is promising that our model recognized the feature importance of 213 coagulability markers, such as PT, PTT, and D-dimer (Figure 3). Thus, this 214 corroboration of the features learned by XGBoost and highlighted by the SHAP analysis 215 with those findings from pathophysiological principles and more recent correlative 216 studies exploring COVID-19 patients(2, 3, 18, 23-25) gives additional credibility to",

            "text": "235 base our predictions solely on a patient's admission labs (i.e. within 36 hours); while this 236 restriction encourages the use of this model in patient triage, events during a patient's 237 hospital stay after admission may drive their clinical course away from the prior 238 probability. Furthermore, not all patient labs are drawn at admission, which introduces 239 an element of missingness in our dataset. For example, unlike the general patient 240 population, patients on anticoagulation therapy, who likely have comorbidities 241 increasing their baseline risk, will have coagulation labs (PT, PTT) taken on admission. 242 However, the shift away from predicting death by the model in the absence of PT/PTT 243 (Figure 3) suggests that missingness in coagulation labs is a proxy for this lower 244 baseline risk secondary to not having comorbid conditions that require anticoagulation 245 therapy. Additionally, patients admitted to the hospital later in the crisis were both 246 beneficiaries of improved patient care protocols from experiential learning, but also 247 victims of resource constraints from overburdened hospitals. These effects, while 248 possibly negated by our large sample size, may also induce temporal variation between 249 patient outcomes. Furthermore, inherent limitations exist when using EHRs, especially 250 those integrated from multiple hospitals. In order to facilitate timely dissemination of our 251 results, we chose not to manually chart review patient notes that may have otherwise 252 provided additional potential features, such as symptoms and clinical course, to 253 incorporate in our model. Because all five hospitals operate in a single health system, 254 system-wide protocols in lab order sets and management protocols were an additional 255 source of bias that may lower external validity. Other interhospital effects such as 256 shuttling COVID-19 cases to certain hospitals for balancing systemic patient burden 257 may also imbalance case severity across hospitals and care management between 258 hospitals; certainly, this was the case for MSW, where mortality at 3-days was far lower 259 (1.7%) than other hospital sites. This was ultimately a major reason to restrict model 260 training to a single center and perform testing out of sample in another hospital center. 261 Finally, though XGBoost is superior to other models at handling missing data, a notable 262 drawback is its bias towards continuous features instead of categorical ones, given 263 increased information represented in the form(28). However, collinearities between 264 some categorical features in this dataset may be present with other continuous features, 265 as exhibited by covariance strength between hypertension and systolic BP crisis. Healthcare institutions are facing extreme difficulties in managing 271 resources and personnel. Physicians are treating record numbers of patients and 272 continuously expose themselves to a highly contagious and virulent disease with 273 varying symptomatology. Only few therapeutic options have demonstrated improvement 274 to patient outcomes. As COVID-19 moves outside of the current epicenter in New York 275 City, healthcare institutions will see a larger influx of affected patients and can benefit 276 from immediate insights regarding assessment of disease severity(29, 30). These 277 models successfully predict critical illness and mortality up to 10 days in advance in a 278 diverse patient population from admission information alone and provide important 279 markers for acute care prognosis that can be used by healthcare institutions to improve 280 care decisions at both the physician and hospital level for management of COVIDstudy, patient data came from five hospitals within the Mount Sinai Hospital 290 System (MSHS): the Mount Sinai Hospital (MSH) located in East Harlem, Manhattan; 291 Mount Sinai Morningside (MSM) located in Morningside Heights, Manhattan; Mount 292 Sinai West (MSW) located in Midtown and the West Side, Manhattan; Mount Sinai 293 Brooklyn (MSB) located in Midwood, Brooklyn; and Mount Sinai Queens (MSQ) located 294 in Astoria, Queens.

Height was absent in a large percentage 325 of the patients (18.2%). Because height is generally invariant in the adult population, 326 and given the resource constraint of the pandemic, it was common for triage nurses to 327 use the height from a previous and recent admission.

Due to discrepancies in how labs were named in 335 different hospitals, a comprehensive review of all lab field names was conducted by a 336 multidisciplinary team of clinical and statistical experts to ensure that there was a direct 337 mapping between all sites. Additionally, many labs represented a single component 338 (e.g. sodium), but were acquired from either an arterial blood gas (ABG), venous blood 339 gas (VBG), and basic metabolic panel (BMP).

Missing data values 365 are routed through split points based on the direction to minimize loss. XGBoost models 366 were trained and evaluated using 10-fold stratified cross validation.
