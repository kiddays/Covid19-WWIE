Less attention has been paid to the spread of respiratory droplets in outdoor environments under microclimatologic turbulent wind and which is of growing importance given the current COVID-19 epidemic. We implement a computational model describing a sneezing person in an urban scenario under a medium intensity climatological wind. Turbulence was described with a wall-modeled Large Eddy Simulation model and the spread of respiratory droplets by using a lagrangian approach. Results show the spread of respiratory droplets is characterized by the dynamics of two groups of droplets of different sizes: larger droplets (400 -900 \u03bcm) are spread between 2-5 m during 2.3 s while smaller (100 -200 \u03bcm) droplets are transported a larger range between 8-11 m by the action of the turbulent wind in 14.1 s average. Given the uncertainty of potential contagion over this way and with this reach, these efforts are an intent to contribute to shine a light on the possibility of adopting stricter self-care and distancing measures.",

This is, by droplets in the air smaller than 5-10 \u03bcm as aerosol, exhaled during breathing or normal speech [2] , with exception of close-contact cases, as for care-takers and direct contact with infected persons at a close range (less than 1 meter). Its general recommendations, and thus from several governments and health agencies, is to keep a distance of at least 1 meter from persons who are coughing or sneezing [3] . The discussion about precautionary measures is indeed important, since it might affect the steps taken to order the free or restricted circulation of people in public places and to minimize contagion, including the use of masks, among others. Within the scientific community there is a lack of consensus, and some opinions are controverted. There have been detections of RNA material further apart from the closer radius, and there is a lack of experiments and systematic trials to determine this fact with more precision, for instance, to see if the amount of material found might account for an effective infectious potential [2, 4] .This takes the discussion further, meaning not only to the scientific community but also to politics and public policy, where precautionary measures can be essential. This study is a consequence of the analysis of scientific literature and news reported by WHO and scientific journals. As a team specialized on the modelling and simulation of fluid flow we could describe and predict some condition related with the spread of respiratory droplets in order to shine a light on one part of the discussion and collaborate to validate or question recommendations to adopt distancing and self-care measures.",

A sneeze exhales more than a million droplets up to a distance of 3 meters. However, the concentration of droplets at 1 meter of distance from its source is reduced down to 0,001% [6] , which coincides with the mentioned distancing recommendations of the WHO [2] . Nevertheless, due to Stokes' drag, the smaller droplets (< 5-10 \u03bcm) stay suspended in the air for prolonged periods of time, situation that might eventually conduce to aero-transported transmission. [2, 6] . On the other hand, out of 75,465 cases of COVID-19 analysed in China, none of them was attributed directly to this mechanism [2, 5] . Specialists from China and the United Kingdom have said that the probability of contracting the virus this way is not completely negligible and that further studies are necessary [4] . The World Health Organisation has emitted an official statement about this situation [2] . However, it has been often misinterpreted by the media. That there is no aero-transported transmission does not mean that the virus transmitted over the air cannot be a carrier of the disease, for instance, in an urban microclimatologic scenario. From the literature and information, we have analysed, this fact has not been explored thoroughly.",

Anthropometric variables like exposed oral and nasal area, as airflow, volume fraction and diameter distribution of droplets, and time of duration of sneeze under analysis were taken from the literature [6, 7, 10] . The microclimatologic scenario related to wind was defined according to [8, 9] and they represent a medium intensity including its attenuation respect to the difference between the average velocity magnitude measured in the periphery and the urban nucleus of cities. The turbulence of the microclimatologic wind was simulated using a wall-modeled Large Eddy Simulation. The dispersion of droplets and its interaction with the velocity field was described using a lagrangian approach. The diameter distribution was modeled by a Rosin-Rammler function. These are relevant technical steps towards realistic outdoor conditions. ",
