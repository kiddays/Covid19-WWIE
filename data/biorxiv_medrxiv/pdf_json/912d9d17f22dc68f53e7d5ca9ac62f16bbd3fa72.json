Here, we quantify and characterize intra-host variation in SARS-CoV-2 raw sequence data uploaded to SRA as of 14 April 2020, and compare results between two sequencing methods (amplicon and RNA-Seq). Raw fastq files were quality filtered and trimmed using Trimmomatic, mapped to the WuhanHu1 reference genome using Bowtie2, and variants called with bcftools mpileup.

The number of polymorphic sites (i.e. sites with multiple alleles) within samples ranged from 0-13, with 72% of samples (295/406) having at least one polymorphic site. Correlation between number of polymorphic sites and coverage was very low for both sequencing methods (R 2 < 0.1, p < 0.05). Polymorphisms were observed >1 sample at 66 sites (range: 2-38 samples). The minor allele frequency (MAF) at each shared polymorphic site was 0.03% -48.5%. 33/66 sites occurred in ORF1a1b, and 37/66 changes were non-synonymous. At 10/66 sites, derived alleles were found in samples sequenced using both methods. Polymorphic amplicon samples were found at 10/10 positions, while polymorphic RNA-Seq samples were found at 7/10 positions. In conclusion, our results suggest that intra-host variation is prevalent among clinical samples. While mutations resulting from amplification and/or sequencing errors cannot be excluded, the observation of shared polymorphic sites with high MAF across multiple samples and sequencing methods is consistent with true underlying variation. Further investigation into intra-host evolutionary dynamics, particularly with longitudinal sampling, is critical for broader understanding of disease progression.",

Among these 406 samples, derived (i.e. non-reference) alleles were found at 408 positions across the genome (Supplemental File 4). The number of sites with the derived allele per sample ranged from 0-15. The number of polymorphic sites (i.e. sites with multiple alleles) within samples ranged from 0-13, with 72% of samples (295/406) having at least one variable site. Correlation between number of polymorphic sites and mean/10x coverage was very low for both sequencing methods (R 2 < 0.1, p < 0.05 for all cases, Supplemental Figure 2). We then assessed how polymorphic sites were distributed among samples. 294/406 positions were polymorphic in at least one sample, while 66 positions were polymorphic in >1 sample. For each site, the percentage of polymorphic samples ranged from 9.3% (38/408) for position 17747 to 0.05% (4/408) for 27 different positions (Figure 1A). Across all 66 positions, the weighted proportion of polymorphic samples compared to all samples with the derived allele was 0.43. Interestingly, position 17747 had both the highest number of polymorphic samples (38/408) as well as the highest proportion of polymorphic samples (0.80).",

Five positions occurred in either the 5' or 3' UTRs. Of the 61 polymorphic positions occurring in translated region, 59 were single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), of which 37 were non-synonymous (including position 17747), and 22 were synonymous (including positions 8782). Two derived alleles at polymorphic positions were deletions, one of which retained the reading frame, while the other did not. Finally, to determine the potential effect of sequencing method on intra-sample variation, we plotted the MAF and the number of samples with a derived variant for each of the 66 shared polymorphic sites (Supplemental Figure 3). The majority of polymorphic sites included samples which were sequenced using the amplicon methodology, reflecting the much more common use of amplicon sequencing in this dataset. At 10 sites, derived alleles were found in samples sequenced using both methods (241, 8782, 14408, 14805, 17747, 17858, 18060, 23403, 26144, and 28144). Polymorphic amplicon samples were found at all 10 positions, while RNA-Seq processed samples were found at 7/10 positions. At the two positions with the highest MAFs (8782 and 17757), polymorphic samples were found in both methods, although clearly higher among the amplicon processed samples.",
