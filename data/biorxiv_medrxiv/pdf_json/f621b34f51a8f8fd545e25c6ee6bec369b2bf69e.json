However, we find that relaxing strong population-wide controls after four weeks will most likely lead to a further outbreak, although the speed of growth of this outbreak can be reduced by fast case isolation, by tracing, testing, or otherwise.

They have been used to explore long-term consequences and strategies for New Zealand should the disease not be contained, but at the early stages of an outbreak or in regions with low population densities, stochastic models are expected to be more appropriate.

In particular we use the model to explore the possible scenarios if New Zealand were to exit its current highly restrictive control measures in late April, after four weeks. The model is intended for use only when case numbers are small relative to population size and herd immunity is not prevalent in limiting secondary cases. It may, however, provide insight into short-term scenarios that explore New Zealand's options towards the end of its first four-week Alert Level 4 lockdown period. Longer term scenarios can be considered using the model if herd immunity is added to the model, but other models should also be considered in these circumstances.",

            "text": "\uf0b7 Infected individuals are grouped into two categories: (i) those who show clinical symptoms at some point during their infection; and (ii) those who are subclinical. Each new infection is randomly assigned as subclinical with probability sub = 0.33 and clinical with probability 1 \u2212 , independent of who infected them. Once assigned as clinical or subclinical, individuals remain in this category for the duration of their infectious period. \uf0b7 In the absence of self-isolation measures (see below), each infected individual causes a randomly generated number ~( ) of new infections. For clinical individuals, = and for subclinical individuals, = , which is assumed to be 50% of (Davies 2020 ). \uf0b7 The model can be generalised to include additional sources of individual heterogeneity by drawing is drawn from a specified distribution (e.g. Lloyd-Smith 2005), instead of simply one of two fixed values and . However for simplicity we ignore individual heterogeneity within the clinical and subclinical categories. \uf0b7 The time between an individual becoming infected and infecting another individual, the generation time , follows a Weibull distribution ( ) with mean and median equal to 5.0 days and standard deviation of 1.9 days (Feretti 2020). The infection times of all secondary infections from individual are independent, identically distributed random variables from this distribution (see Figure 1 ). \uf0b7 Clinical individuals have an initial period during which they are either asymptomatic or have sufficiently mild symptoms that they have not self-isolated. During this period, their infectiousness is as shown by the blue curve in Figure 1 . At the end of this period, once they have developed more serious symptoms, they are isolated and their infectiousness reduces to = 65% (Davies 2020) of the value it would have without isolation (green curve in Figure 1 ). This represents a control policy of requiring symptomatic individuals to self-isolate. \uf0b7 Subclinical individuals do not get isolated and are not reported in case data. \uf0b7 All individuals are assumed to be no longer infectious 30 days after being infected. This is an upper limit for computational convenience; in practice, individuals have very low infectiousness after about 12 days because of the shape of the generation time distribution (Fig. 1 ). \uf0b7 Individuals who have recovered from the virus are assumed to have immunity for the duration of the period simulated and cannot be infected again. This means that the proportion of the population that is susceptible at time is 1 \u2212 ( )/ , where ( ) is the cumulative number of infections at time and is the total population size. \uf0b7 The time between infection and isolation the sum of two random variables 1 and 2 . 1 represents the incubation period (time from infection to onset of symptoms) and has a gamma distribution with mean 5.5 days and shape parameter 5.8 (Lauer 2020). 2 represents the time from onset to isolation and is taken from New Zealand case data (see below). \uf0b7 The model does not explicitly include a latent period or pre-symptomatic period. However, the shape of the Weibull generation time distribution (Figure 1 ) captures these phases, giving a low probability of a short generation time between infections and with 90% of infections occurring between 2.0 days and 8.4 days after infection.

At the time of writing, New Zealand is at Alert Level 4, which includes strong population-wide controls such as: \uf0b7 requiring anyone not involved in essential work to stay at home; \uf0b7 the closure of educational facilities; \uf0b7 the closure of businesses, except for essential services such as supermarkets, pharmacies and clinics, and lifeline utilities. These measures were enacted on 25 March, and at the time of writing, there has been an insufficient period of time to fully observe their effectiveness from clinical case data alone. New Zealand only spent two days at Alert Level 3, and these days were unlikely to be representative of how these control measures may work in the longer term. Nonetheless, we can observe the effects of similar population-wide controls in other countries, some of which have been in place for significantly longer. We categorise these controls in two ways: by their apparent strength compared to the New Zealand Alert Level system, and by their observed effectiveness in controlling case numbers. Following Binny et al (Binny 2020) , we summarise this categorisation in Table 2 . It is evident from the table that the effectiveness of controls varies widely, which likely reflects the time over which the controls have been in place as well as political, social, and cultural considerations. 1 See www.covid19.govt.nz .

New South Wales has also demonstrated highly effective Alert Level 3 strength controls, with a basic reproduction number observed to be just over one.

Case numbers are slowly reduced to a level of approximately 30 per day for the period of Level 3 controls. In scenario D however (effective reproduction numbers 1.06 and 0.68 in levels 3 and 4 respectively), cases gradually rise after the transition to Level 3 controls (not shown).

This opens up the possibility of containment or elimination, scenarios that are very distant for most other countries. We summarise the results of the scenarios considered here in Table 3 . An optimistic scenario with strong effective controls and rapid case isolation can contain the outbreak at the end of the four week Level 4 period. Other scenarios where the Level 4 controls are relaxed at the end of four weeks lead to a further outbreak. These scenarios would require the re-imposition of Level 4 control at a later stage if this second outbreak were to be controlled. Longer control periods allow for containment in realistic scenarios with rapid case isolation. Longer control periods are more likely to be able to reduce the number of cases so levels where COVID-19 might be eliminated.",

Further versions of this model will include an age-structured population with the possibility that contact rates between age groups or other demographic groupings could be differentially affected by specific control interventions. It will be important to consider the effects of geographic dispersion and contact network structure. This will allow for investigation of regional containment combined with inter-regional travel restrictions, selective reopening of schools and businesses, and potential harms to at risk communities and essential workers. The branching process model assumes that all infected individuals in either the clinical category or the subclinical category have the same transmission rate. This understates the effect of stochasticity and demographic variability among individuals. In reality, there will be a distribution of transmission rates and the model could be generalised to include this. The effect of this is to increase variance in the model trajectories, and this tends to results in a higher proportion of realisations ending in elimination, but conversely faster growing outbreaks for realisations that do not end in elimination (Lloyd-Smith et al, 2005) .",

A strategy aimed at containment might move the alert level down if the number of new cases falls below some threshold.
