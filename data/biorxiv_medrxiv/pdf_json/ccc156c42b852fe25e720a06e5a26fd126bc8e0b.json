            "text": "Infection with hepatitis C virus (HCV) remains to be a major cause of morbidity and mortality 22 worldwide despite the recent advent of highly effective direct-acting antivirals. The envelope 23 glycoproteins of HCV are heavily glycosylated with a high proportion of high-mannose glycans 24 (HMGs), which serve as a shield against neutralizing antibodies and assist in the interaction with 25 cell-entry receptors. However, currently there is no approved therapeutic targeting this 26 potentially druggable biomarker. Here, we investigated the therapeutic potential of the lectibody 27 Avaren-Fc (AvFc), a HMG-binding lectin-Fc fusion protein. In vitro assays showed AvFc's 28 capacity to neutralize cell culture-derived HCV in a genotype independent manner with IC 50 29 values in the low nanomolar range. A histidine buffer-based AvFc formulation was developed 30 for in vivo studies using the PXB human liver chimeric mouse model. Systemic administration 31 of AvFc was well tolerated; after 11 consecutive doses every other day at 25 mg/kg, there were 32 no significant changes in body or liver weights, nor any impact noted in blood human albumin 33 levels or serum alanine aminotransferase activity. Gross necropsy and liver pathology further 34 confirmed the lack of discernible toxicity. This treatment regimen successfully prevented 35 genotype 1a HCV infection in all animals, while an AvFc mutant lacking HMG binding activity 36 failed to block the infection. These results suggest that targeting envelope HMGs is a promising 37 therapeutic approach against HCV infection. In particular, AvFc may provide a safe and 38 efficacious means to prevent recurrent infection upon liver transplantation in HCV-related end-39",

Consequently, these results suggested that administration of the drug every other day 216 (Q2D) might be sufficient to keep the virus under control in a murine HCV challenge model. 217 We then assessed the safety of Q2D administration of AvFc in PXB-mice\u00ae. To 218 effectively discern potential toxicity associated with AvFc's HMG-binding activity, we included 219 an AvFc variant lacking HMG-binding activity as a control (AvFc lec-; Figure S2 ). PXB mice 220 received either the vehicle (the histidine buffer described above) Q2D for 11 total doses, AvFc at 221 25 mg/kg Q2D for a total of 8 or 11 doses, or AvFc lecat 25 mg/kg Q2D for 11 total doses. As 222 shown in Figure 4A -C, no significant differences in either body weights, blood h-Alb levels or weight were seen ( Figure 4D ). These results indicate that AvFc, formulated in the histidine 225 buffer, is well tolerated in the immunocompromised mice engrafted with human hepatocytes.",

In line with this hypothesis,281 Hoque et al. demonstrated that the three binding pockets of the parent lectin actinohivin can bind 282 up to three independent HMGs, providing high affinity binding when the HMGs are in relatively 283 close proximity (40). This implies that AvFc may not effectively interact with healthy normal 284 cells and tissues that do not usually exhibit clusters of HMGs on their surfaces. In contrast, 285 glycoproteins of many enveloped viruses display a high proportion of these immature forms of 286 N-glycans (20-22). While HCV E2 has fewer N-glycosylation sites (around 11) than the HIV 287 glycoprotein gp120 (which has between 20 and 30 depending on the strain), E2 is likely present 288 on the surface of HCV at a higher density and thus provides higher local concentrations of 289 HMGs (41).

As a consequence, reinfection of donor livers universally occurs, as early as in the 297 first 90 minutes upon reperfusion (17), and can result in accelerated fibrosis and increased risk of 298 graft failure, cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma (43). In fact, allograft failure due to 299 reinfection is the leading cause of secondary transplants and death in HCV-infected patients who 300 have received liver transplant (44), Patients cured of HCV with DAAs after liver transplantation 301 still have a higher than normal risk of hepatocellular carcinoma (45), and the high cost of the 302 drugs represents a significant barrier to their widespread use. Furthermore, emergent drug 303 resistance even in DAA combination therapies, though rare, represents a particular challenge for 304 further treatment (46). Thus, while the effectiveness of DAAs is not in question, there are still 305 unmet needs that may be addressed through the use of entry inhibitors. As of yet, no entry 306 inhibitor has been approved for the treatment or prevention of HCV. Two major drug candidates, 307 Civacir\u00ae and MBL-HCV1, have shown some promise in clinical trials (NCT01804829, 308 NCT01532908) (47, 48). Though larger studies are needed, it appears that entry inhibitors in 309 combination with DAAs may represent a new treatment paradigm for HCV patients receiving 310 liver transplant. Despite that both MBL-HCV1 and Civacir\u00ae are capable of neutralizing a broad 311 range of HCV genotypes, viral resistance can still develop through mutations in the envelope 312 proteins E1/E2, in particular through shifting glycan positions (49, 50). In this regard, AvFc in its 313 own right could be less susceptible to amino acid mutations because it targets the glycan shield 314 of the virus rather than a specific epitope.
