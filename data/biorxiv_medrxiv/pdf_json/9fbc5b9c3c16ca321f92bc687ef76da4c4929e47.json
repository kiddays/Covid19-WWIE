Because of the time constraints associated with the development of vaccines and effective drugs, drug repurposing and other alternative treatment methods have been used to treat patients that have been infected by the SARS-CoV-2 virus and have acquired COVID-19. In this systematic review, we provide an overview of the molecular mechanism of action of repurposed drugs or alternative treatment medicines used to attenuate COVID-19 disease. The research articles or grey literature, including theses, government reports, and official news online, were identified from 4 databases and 1 search engine. The full content of a total of 160 articles that fulfilled our inclusion criteria was analyzed and information about 6 drugs (ritonavir, lopinavir, oseltamivir, remdesivir, favipiravir, and chloroquine) and 4 traditional Chinese medicines (",

The International Committee of Taxonomy of Viruses has officially named the disease \"COVID-19 (Corona Virus Disease 2019)\" and the virus SARS-CoV-2 [1, 2] . The new corona virus has rapidly spread among humans all over the world and has led to hundreds of thousands of cases within a few months. As a result, on 11 th March 2020 the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a pandemic, which is defined as \"worldwide spread of a new disease\". As of 26 th March 2020, more than 462,684 laboratory-confirmed cases of COVID-19 have been reported globally, with the total number of deaths reaching 20,834 (4.5%) people [3] . The worldwide distribution of COVID-19 cases as of 26 th March 2020, 10:00 (CET) is shown in Figure 1 . CoVs are single-stranded RNA viruses that look like a crown under a microscope (coronam is the Latin word for crown) and contain spike glycoproteins on the envelope. The subfamily Orthocoronavirinae of the Coronaviridae family (order Nidovirales) is classified into four genera of CoVs: alphaCoV, betaCoV, deltaCoV, and gammaCoV. SARS-CoV-2 is categorized as a betaCoV. It has an elliptic or round and often pleomorphic form, with a diameter of 60-140 nm. Like other betaCoVs, SARS-CoV-2 is sensitive to ultraviolet rays and heat and can be effectively killed by lipid solvents. Acute respiratory illness appears to be the most common manifestation of COVID-19 infection. The spectrum of symptomatic infection ranges from mild to severe; most infections are not severe [4] [5] [6] :",

Aerosol transmission is also possible in closed areas. Infection might also happen if someone touches a contaminated surface and then touches their own eyes, nose, or mouth [10] [11] [12] . Although symptomatic people are the most frequent source of COVID-19 spread, the possibility of transmission before symptoms develop, or even from individuals who remain asymptomatic, cannot be excluded. Moreover, the period during which an individual with COVID-19 is infectious is uncertain. The duration of viral shedding is also variable [12] [13] [14] [15] . Data suggests that the use of social distancing is the best way to control this pandemic. Several countries have taken measures such as mobility restrictions, drastic social distancing, school closures, and travel bans, which could significantly disrupt economic and social stability.",

There is neither a vaccine to prevent infections nor clinically approved antiviral drugs to treat COVID-19; therefore, identifying drug treatment options as soon as possible is critical for responding to the pandemic. Clinical trials for vaccines are currently underway. Potential vaccines have been administered to volunteers in a phase 1 safety trial by the USA government; however, the efficacy, such as how long immunity will last or if people might become infected even if they possess a high level of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2, will not become clear for at least one year after injection [16] . Furthermore, the safety of the developed vaccines is unknown because laboratory tests are being conducted in parallel to clinical trial phase 1 owing to the emergence of COVID-19 as a pandemic. The unknown efficacy and safety of the vaccines used might cause disease enhancement, by which vaccinated subjects might develop an even more severe form of disease than the subjects that have not been vaccinated, which has been shown in studies of SARS vaccines, in which vaccinated ferrets developed damaging inflammation in their livers after they were infected with the virus [17] . Until now, no drugs have been successfully developed for the control of COVID-19 [18] ; however, numerous effort are underway worldwide, and particularly in China [19] . Therefore, drug repurposing and the use of existing alternative medicine have been used as effective methods for the treatment of patients with COVID-19. In this comprehensive review, we reviewed the use of existing drugs or alternative treatment methods and discussed the mode of action from a molecular mechanism perspective to attenuate COVID-19 in the human system.",

This results in the formation of immature HIV particles that are not infectious. However, the extremely high mutation rate of HIV-1 in vivo [28] has given rise to a strain of HIV-1 that is resistant to ritonavir. The rise of ritonavir-resistant HIV strains has led the development of more effective drugs for combating HIV infections, one of which is lopinavir.

Compared with ritonavir, a lower amount of lopinavir is required to achieve EC50 (17 nM versus 25 nM) [30] . Although it is more effective (in terms of concentration required to achieve EC50), in vitro experiments with human liver microsomes have revealed that lopinavir undergoes oxidative metabolism by the cytochrome P450 3A4 enzyme [31], thus reducing the bioavailability of lopinavir. To combat this, lopinavir is administered together with ritonavir, which can inhibit P450 3A4 enzyme activity. The high rate of mutation of HIV has given rise to drug-resistant (against lopinavir/ritonavir) HIV strains, with lopinavir/ritonavir acting as the selective pressure.

The administration of ritonavir and lopinavir for the treatment of COVID-19 might be owing to the similarity of the genome sequence to SARS-CoV approximately 79.6% and originated from the same genus as SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV (Betacoronavirus) [4] . Therefore, therapies and drugs developed for the treatment of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV could be used for the development of COVID-19 therapeutics and assumed that the mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 is similar to its family members [22] . Lopinavir/ritonavir have been administered to patients diagnosed with moderate stage COVID-19, which is the second stage of established pulmonary disease and viral multiplication A molecular dynamics simulation suggested that lopinavir and ritonavir are able to inhibit the SARS-CoV 3CL pro enzyme (required for the processing of the SARS-CoV polyprotein containing the replicase enzyme) by binding to the enzyme's active site, with neither of them having a higher binding affinity than the other [35]. However, a binding analysis showed that half of the lopinavir was left outside of the catalytic site and one of ritonavir's benzene side chains might be too long to perfectly fit the substrate binding pocket. This would lead to ritonavir and lopinavir having poor efficacy, and this is reflected in weak in vitro activity against SARS-CoV [36]. Another study suggests that both lopinavir and ritonavir have no effect on SARS-CoV replication, with nelfinavir being the only inhibitor that has an effect on SARS-CoV replication [37]. Despite not having any effect on SARS-CoV replication, lopinavir does have antiviral activity against SARS-CoV, with one study suggesting lopinavir has a synergistic effect when used with ribavirin [38] . A study conducted on lopinavir's and ritonavir's effectiveness against MERS-CoV showed that although lopinavir and ritonavir have antiviral activity against MERS-CoV, their effectiveness is lower than interferon beta and remdesivir [39] .",

Oseltamivir phosphate is readily absorbed in the gastrointestinal tract, after which it is converted by hepatic esterases into its active form, oseltamivir carboxylase, a competitive inhibitor to neuraminidase found in influenza A and influenza B [24] . It reversibly binds to the active site of the neuraminidase, preventing the neuraminidase from cleaving the sialic acid residues [44] found on the surface of the host cell. This prevents the entry of the virus into uninfected cells, the release of newly formed virions from the infected cells, and reduces both viral shedding and infectivity of the virus [24]. Oseltamivir is eliminated from the body in the urine, and in vitro studies have shown that both oseltamivir phosphate and oseltamivir carboxylate is not susceptible to metabolism by the cytochrome P450 enzymes [45] . Although it can be used to prevent influenza infections, consumption of oseltamivir is not a substitute for influenza vaccination [45] . The common side effects of oseltamivir are nausea and vomiting, ranging from mild to moderate severity. These side effects can be mitigated by consuming oseltamivir with food [46]. . This led to a marked improvement in her pneumonia condition in 8 -12 hours. She tested negative for the COVID-19 after 48 hours. The drug cocktail was administered for the next 10 days, and subsequent tests for COVID-19 over the next 20 days gave negative results. However, the synergistic effect of the combination of these drugs is unclear because oseltamivir does not inhibit SARS-CoV [48] and MERS-CoV like lopinavir and ritonavir [49] . The repurposing of ritonavir, lopinavir, and oseltamivir for the treatment of COVID-19 is currently being studied by companies such as AbbVie Inc [33].",

In comparison with other antiviral drugs such as lopinavir, ritonavir, and interferon beta, remdesivir displayed superior antiviral activity in vitro using Calu-3 cells with MERS-nanoluciferase and in vivo in a transgenic mouse with a humanized MERS-CoV receptor (dipeptidyl peptidase 4, hDPP4) (Sheahan, 2020) . The study stated that both prophylactic and therapeutic remdesivir improve pulmonary function and reduce lung viral loads and severe lung pathology. The data prompted an efficacy test of prophylactic and therapeutic remdesivir treatment in a nonhuman primate model of MERS-CoV infection, the rhesus macaque [60] .

The small animal data generates cautious optimism about translating the findings into nonhuman primate trials. Prophylactic and complement therapeutic treatment with favipiravir against EBOV on nonhuman primates successfully inhibited viral production and extended survival time in a concentration-dependent manner [83] . Another pharmacokinetic study of favipiravir in nonhuman primates against two filoviruses (EBOV and Marburg) also supported the antiviral effect of favipiravir compared with untreated animals. Reduced levels of viral RNA and extended survival time was observed in EBOV-infected nonhuman primates, whereas 83% of the MARV-infected nonhuman primates survived upon treatment with favipiravir [84] . In 2014, a proof-of-concept trial of favipiravir in patients with EVD in Guinea was initiated, in which patients received favipiravir along with standardized care [85] . Data on the safety and effectiveness of favipiravir in reducing mortality and viral load were collected. The study reported a lower fatality rate among patients with low to moderate viral load compared with the control group. The findings were supported by FPV trials in Sierra Leone and different parts of Guinea [15, 86] .",

A pilot study of a nonrandomized control trial at The Third People's Hospital of Shenzhen reported significantly better treatment effects in terms of disease progression and viral clearance compared with lopinavir/ritonavir treatment [87] . A different randomized clinical trial was conducted at three hospitals in China (Zhongnam Hospital of Wuhan University, Leishenshan Hospital, The Third People's Hospital of Hubei Province) to compare the efficacy and safety of favipiravir and arbidol to treat COVID-19 patients [88] . The trial recruited a total of 240 patients and followed up from Feb 20, 2020 to Mar 12, 2020. Patients in the experimental group received various doses of 1600-2400 mg of favipiravir and compared with patients treated with other multiple antiviral drugs: kaletra, oseltamivir, and hydroxychloroquine. Favipiravir-treated patients were found to have a higher clinical recovery rate and more effectively reduced incidence of fever and cough which manifested as mild and moderate symptoms of COVID-19 where during this initial stage, SARS-CoV-2 multiplies and binds to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor on human cells [7, 8] . Other clinical trials of favipiravir monotherapy or combination drug therapy are currently ongoing in China and Thailand to further evaluate the efficacy and safety of favipiravir for the treatment of COVID-19 disease. There is still insufficient data to determine the mechanism of action of favipiravir for the treatment of patients diagnosed with COVID-19.",

Animal studies, on the other hand, have revealed mixed results. Treatment with chloroquine showed no significant protection against SARS-CoV and EBOV with reports of high toxicity in mouse and hamster models [110, 111] . However, other studies have reported positive results against HCoV-OC43 and EBOV when treated with chloroquine [109, 112] . The contradict results in animal studies could be owing to the range of doses tested, whereby higher doses could be necessary to produce consistently positive results. However, this may lead to a poor outcome owing to an increase in drug related toxicity. Furthermore, chloroquine may be more effective as a prophylactic treatment owing to its activity during the early stages of a viral cycle, during which it establishes residence in the host through replication of SARS-CoV-2 during the incubation period in patients in the initial stage of the disease, which is a mild condition [7].",

It is a Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) comprised of three medicinal plants; 375g of Lonicera japonica, 375 g of Scutellaria baicalensis, and 750 g of Forsythia suspense according to Pharmacopoeia of the People's Republic of China [118] . It is often widely prescribed by Chinese practitioners for the treatment of high fever, coma, and respiratory diseases [119] . According to Professor Zhao Zhi Li from Shanghai Traditional Chinese Medicine University, Scutellaria baicalensis is acknowledged as a middle class medicine and Forsythia suspense as a low class medicine recorded in Shennong's Classic of Materia Medica from Han dynasty according to its ranking for medicinal value with high class or A level as the most valued in terms of pharmacology, whereas Lonicera japonica has been used as a medicinal plant for the treatment of diseases since the Southern and Northern Dynasty in \"Mingyi Bielu\" [120, 121] . There is a total of 12 companies that manufacture this antidote and one of the manufacturers, Hayao Company's Shuang Huang Lian Kou Fu Ye was categorized as an \"A level\" list drug, which is the best quality of drugs in TCM according to the categorization in 2019 National health insurance project in China [115] .",

However, this TCM was not included in the guideline launched by National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China for prevention of COVID-19 which have been updated to version 7 and known as Guidelines of Diagnosis and Treatment for COVID-19 version 4 report in China for prevention of COVID-19, as reported by China News [115, 123] . This is because the findings were limited to an initial laboratory phase and insufficient data was available to confirm that this TCM can suppress SARS-CoV-2. A clinical trial is still essential to verify its efficacy. As a result, Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center and Wuhan Tongji Hospital have initiated a clinical trial on Shuang Huang Lian Kou Fu Ye [124] . Although there is still insufficient scientific evidence that this TCM can be used to control COVID-19, it still widely used and the Beijing Administration of Traditional Chinese Medicine claims that it is one of the TCM that can be used to prevent COVID-19. Because both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are from the coronaviruses family, the strategies used for the treatment of SARS could be relevant for COVID-19 [125] . Furthermore, the medicinal plants that in this TCM are known for their antiviral function and have been utilized to alleviate influenza and restrain SARS coronavirus.",

However, this TCM has been used to fight SARS-CoV-2 because of its effectiveness to treat severe pneumonia, the severe stage of COVID- 19 [9] , by significantly reducing mortality by approximately 15.9% and elevating the improvement of the pneumonia severity index by approximately 60.8% [160] . The Xue Bi Jing Injection relieved or reduced severe pneumonia by triggering the inflammation pathway through downregulation of TNF-\u03b1, IL-6 and IL-8 on the 3rd, 7th and 14th day after treatment, although it did not significantly influence the release of leptin [177] . This suggest that an anti-endotoxin effect was deployed by halting the release of TNF-\u03b1, IL-6 and IL-8, endogenic inflammatory mediators. As a result, blocking the development of a systemic inflammatory response syndrome occurred through the disruption of the inflammation vicious cycle [177] . This mechanism of action of the Xue Bi Jing Injection reduces the severity of pneumonia in COVID-19 patients and lowers the side effects on the organ functions.",

However, the mechanism of action of oseltamivir combined with kaletra remains unclear and needs further experimental validation. Therefore, the combination of ritonavir and lopinavir are essential to maintain the drug efficacy for the treatment of COVID-19 during their function in preventing the binding to the SARS-CoV 3CL pro enzyme site, which is responsible for the replication of SARS-CoV-2 glycoprotein. Furthermore, remdesivir and favipiravir attenuated replication of SARS-CoV-2 through premature termination of RNA transcription. Chloroquine shows a potential antiviral effect in vitro, however, there is a lack of in vivo data to support therapeutic treatment for SARS-CoV-2 infection. In contrast to the 6 drugs mentioned above, the 4 TCMs discussed in this review were initially used to treat influenza and SARS by acting as neuraminidase blockers and triggering the inflammation pathway such as blocking the release of endogenic inflammatory mediators, TNF-\u03b1, IL-6, and IL-8 to halt the inflammation mechanism of action instead of RNA chain termination. New drugs that are effective for the treatment COVID-19 are still in development or in clinical trials. In this review we provide a framework for better understanding of the mechanism of action of repurposed drugs and TCMs and their involvement in the molecular pathway for inhibiting viral replication such as SARS or MERS. We hope this will provide insights into the molecular pathway and lead to the development of effective drugs for the treatment of COVID-19 in the future. However, further experimental validation is needed to provide more concrete evidence.",

Different combinations of the following keywords: NCov-2019, COVID-19, 2019-nCoV, SARS-CoV-2, 2019 novel coronavirus, Wuhan virus, drug repurposing, medication, treatment, traditional Chinese medicine, alternative and complementary medicine were used in the literature search through a three-level search strategy based on standardized descriptors defined by the Medical Subject Headings algorithm. A secondary search was based on screening of the reference list of all the relevant studies identified in the direct search. The entire potentially relevant studies were evaluated after title screening to exclude irrelevant information. Only studies that reported the repurposing of drugs and TCMs for COVID-19 and contained information about the structure of the chemical constituents, in vivo or in vitro studies, case reports, treatment of patients diagnosed with COVID-19, and molecular mechanisms were extracted and assessed.",
