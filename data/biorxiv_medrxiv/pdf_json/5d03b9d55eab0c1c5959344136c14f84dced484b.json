These include three developing countries in the Central Asia region and seven countries from Eastern European region, which for the best part of the 20th century, were part of the Soviet Union until their independence in the early 1990s. While these counties currently have different economic and political systems, most of these countries have similar healthcare systems and public health challenges inherited from Soviet Union (7).

An outbreak predicting system is an extremely useful and vital tool of preparedness of such events. The majority of these systems utilizes available data and applies mathematical and/or statistical modeling capable of predicting a future outbreak (14, 15). There were several attempts in different countries to establish a modelling method for the prediction of COVID-19 spread including a group in China which estimated the serial interval for COVID-19 (16), to predict the dynamics of COVID-19 spread (17) . Applying a mathematical model on the available data, a group showed that lockdown measures were effective in reducing COVID-19 transmission rate and that imported cases have a different dynamic of transmission. Similarly, using an age-structured compartmental model of COVID-19 transmission, a Canadian group showed that significant strengthening of quarantine measures could prevent extreme overloading of intensive care unit (ICU) resources (18). However, the situation in the Post-Soviet countries remains uninvestigated.",

Given the absence of COVID-19 infected cases, Tajikistan and Turkmenistan were excluded from the study. Also, Baltic states (Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania) were excluded due to the difference in their health care systems, policy implementation and economic situation to that of the Post-Soviet States. Of note, the included COVID-19 cases were laboratory confirmed using WHO guidelines (24) while recovered cases were defined as \"those that were previously tested positive to COVID-19 (laboratory confirmed) and later had negative test results\".

This, however, is a common limitation given the novelty of the virus and limited access to testing in the majority of countries. The second limitation is that some countries have implemented certain policies that limit the reporting of incidence of COVID-19, and therefore, we cannot provide predictions for Turkmenistan and Tajikistan. The third limitation is that the current burden of COVID-19 is comparatively in the early stages of development and somewhat insignificant in some post-Soviet countries, which makes our projections less robust. The fourth limitation is that we do not take into account the spread within a specific country (regional, geographical), since we considered countries as entities, and individuals are not considered. For instance, in Kazakhstan, first cases and the majority of cases were reported in densely populated major cities (Almaty and Nur-Sultan), while the outbreak reached other less populated cities a week later. The further limitation is that the modeling is not stratified by age; thus, we could not estimate the number of cases of whom would likely to require ICU treatment. Another limitation is that we do not consider how each of preventive measures (e.g. wearing masks, physical distancing, hand washing) plays role in the protection rate and dynamics of the spread within healthcare settings.",

It was estimated that R 0 value is steeply decreasing in all countries suggesting that the governments have implemented more stringent measures to prevent the spread of COVID-19. The estimated R 0 for Belarus was the highest out of all other countries highlighting the Belarusian government's reluctance to take stricter actions to battle COVID-19 outbreak. On the other hand, Kazakhstan, and Armenia were showing promising R 0 values less than <1 indicating a potential reduction in transmissibility in the upcoming weeks. However, due to insufficient data in early stages of the outbreaks,estimated R 0 values should be recalibrated for Belarus as it might not accurately predict the future dynamics of COVID-19. Despite the relatively similar dates of the first confirmed cases across the post-Soviet countries (13), the predictions for COVID-19 outbreak dynamics in each country were significantly different. For instance, Armenia, Moldova, Georgia, Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan, Azerbaijan, and Kazakhstan, would likely have relatively a smaller number of cases than Russia, Ukraine, and Belarus, suggesting the success of the early governmental imposed prevention measures. It should also be noticed that the timeline of the outbreaks is associated with proximity to the epidemic of European countries (29). The Central Asian countries (Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan and Uzbekistan) have faced the outbreaks later and almost at the same time and were quick to implement national preventive measures. Geographical remoteness and low air travelling from the epidemic European countries to the Central Asian countries could have delayed epidemic introduction and allowed them to learn and act more effectively than others (22, 23). On the , the significantly large expected numbers of COVID-19 cases in Belarus, Ukraine and Russia could put a substantial burden on the healthcare systems in these countries. Given the comparatively larger percentage of population older than 65 years old in these countries, it could be anticipated that older individuals with COVID-19 would overwhelm ICU capacity in all hospitals in the major cities which may lead to high mortality (18). Considering low total expenditure on health as percentage of GDP and reluctance from the Belarusian government to implement similar stringent preventive measures, the state could be in a disastrous situation where all healthcare resources could be exhausted to treat the unbearably large number of severe cases (21). Containment of epidemics in inherently weak health care systems of the Post-Soviet States could be quite a challenging task to deal with. Despite the seemingly successful containment efforts in some countries, there is a possibility of repeated epidemics after loosening quarantine measures since a large proportion of the population will be susceptible to COVID-19 or until an effective prophylaxis or post infection treatment is developed and manufactured at population scale. Post-Soviet States have considered the economic situation and preparedness of their healthcare systems in handling the current epidemic, and consequently have taken similar and stringent actions to prevent the spread, except Belarus (6, 7). The results of current modeling show that Armenia, Azerbaijan, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Moldova and Uzbekistan have taken effective preventive actions against the COVID-19 spread. However, Belarus with a weak economy and unwillingness to slow down the economy could be facing extreme consequences from potential collapse of their healthcare system as well as to possibly become one of the states with the largest number of COVID-19 casualties. Ukraine and Russia were slow in placing preventive actions from the beginning of the outbreak, and without abiding stringent actions they could be facing extreme number of cases comparable to some Western European countries. The Central Asian countries will most likely fortunate in avoiding major catastrophe",
