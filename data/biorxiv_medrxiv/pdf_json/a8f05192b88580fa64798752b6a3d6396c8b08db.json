Although most patients experience mild-to-moderate disease, 10 to 20% progress to severe or critical disease, including pneumonia and acute respiratory failure 2 . Based on data from patients with laboratory-confirmed Covid-19 from mainland China, admission to intensive care unit (ICU), invasive mechanical ventilation or death occurred in 6.1%of cases 1 . This proportion of critical cases is higher than that estimated for seasonal Influenza 3 . Additionally, relatively high rates of respiratory failure were reported in young adults (aged 50 years and lower) with previously mild comorbidities (hypertension, diabetes mellitus, overweight) 4 . In severe cases, clinical observations typically describe a two-step disease progression, starting with a mild-to-moderate presentation followed by a secondary respiratory worsening 9 to 12 days after onset of first symptoms 2, 5, 6 . Respiratory deterioration is concomitant with extension of ground-glass lung opacities on chest computed tomography (CT) scans, lymphocytopenia, high prothrombin time and D-dimer levels 2 . This biphasic evolution marked by a dramatic increase of acute phase reactants in the blood suggests a dysregulated inflammatory host response resulting in an imbalance between pro-and anti-inflammatory mediators. This leads to the subsequent recruitment and accumulation of leukocytes in tissues causing acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) 7 . However, little is known about the immunological features and the molecular mechanisms involved in Covid-19 severity.",

Our study also provides a case for the inhibition of the TNF axis. Indeed, TNF is highly expressed in alveolar macrophages and anti-TNF does not block immune response in animal models of virus infection 40 . Moreover, TNF blockade induces a significant IL-6 expression reduction 40 . Other targets could also be considered such as chemokines antagonists that block migration of monocytes and neutrophils to the inflamed lungs.",

To further characterize it, we used mass cytometry and performed Visualization of t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (viSNE) 11 to compare cell population densities according to disease severity (Figure 1B). viSNE representation and differentiated cell counts showed a decrease in the density of NK cells and CD3+ T cells, including all T cell subsets but more pronounced for CD8+ T cells. This phenotype was more prominent in severe and critical patients, contrasting with an increase in the density of B cells and monocytes (Figure 1C-F). No major imbalance in CD4+ and CD8+ T cell na\u00efve/memory subset was observed (Supplementary Figure 2). Data on T cell polarization and other minor T cell subsets are indicated in Supplementary Figure 3. Plasmablasts were enriched in infected patients (Figure 1F), as supported by the increase in genes associated with B cell activation and plasmablast differentiation, such as IL4R, TNFSF13B and XBP1 (Supplementary Figure 4). We then assessed the functional status of specific T cell subsets and NK cells using markers of activation (CD25, CD38, HLA-DR) and exhaustion (PD-1, Tim-3) (Supplementary Figure 5A). The CD4+ and CD8+ T cell populations were characterized by an increase in CD38+ HLA-DR+ activated T cells in infected patients, with an expression of PD-1 modestly increasing with disease severity (Figure 1G, Supplementary Figure 5B).

Expression of IL-6-induced genes, such as IL6R, SOCS3 and STAT3 were significantly increased (Supplementary Figure 8B) reflecting the activation of the IL-6 signaling pathway.TNF-\u03b1, a key driver of inflammation, was only moderately upregulated at the transcriptional level(Supplementary Figure 8C), whereas circulating TNF-\u03b1 was significantly increased(Figure 4C). Accordingly, TNF pathway-related genes were also upregulated, including TNFSF10 (SupplementaryFigure 8D-E), supporting an important role for TNF-\u03b1 in the induction of inflammation. The discrepancy between RNA quantification and protein measurement suggests that cellular sources of TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6 originated more likely from the injured lungs and/or endothelial cells.Conversely, while IL1B transcripts were significantly upregulated (Supplementary",

In contrast, no increase of IFN-\u03b3 and IL-17A proteins was detected in severe patients (SupplementaryFigure 9). We explored the expression of transcription factors that may drive this exacerbated inflammation and found that genes specifically upregulated in most of severe and critical ill patients mostly belonged to the NF\u03baB pathway (Figure 4F, Supplementary Figure 10). Aberrant NF\u03baB activation can result, among several triggering pathways, from excessive innate immune sensors activation by pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) (e.g. viral RNA) and/or damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) (e.g. released by necrotic cells and tissue damage). Interestingly, LDH, a marker of necrosis and cellular injury, correlated with disease severity (Supplementary Figure 1C), and receptor-interacting protein kinase (RIPK)-3, a key kinase involved in programmed necrosis and inflammatory cell death, was also significantly elevated in severe and critically ill patients (Figure 4G) and correlated with LDH (R 2 =0.47; P<0.0001).",

Type I IFNs, which include IFN-\u03b1, \u03b2 and \u03c9, are hence rapidly induced and orchestrate a coordinated antiviral program 21 via the JAK-STAT signaling pathway and expression of ISGs 21 . We herein observed that most severe Covid-19 patients displayed a lower viral clearance possibly caused by an impaired type I IFN production while cellular response to stimulation was preserved. Further longitudinal studies will be necessary to assess in severe and critical patients whether reduced IFN production is present since the onset of infection, whether the peak is delayed, or whether IFN production is exhausted after an initial peak. SARS-CoV2 may have evolved efficient mechanisms to evade host innate immune pathways. Supporting this hypothesis, it was recently reported that SARS-CoV-2 demonstrated a higher replication rate and a lower induction of host interferon in comparison to SARS-CoV-122 . Moreover, virulent human coronaviruses including SARS-CoV-2 have been shown to encode multiple structural and non-structural proteins that antagonize IFN and ISG responses, notably by inhibiting the TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1)-dependent phosphorylation and activation of interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3), and IFN production 23-26 .",

Genetic host susceptibility can be also suspected since inherited monogenic disorders in children 31,32 or susceptibility variants in adults 33 , each involving the type I IFN pathway, have been associated with life-threatening influenza infections. Identification of patients with insufficient IFN production could define a high-risk population that could benefit from IFN-\u03b1 or -\u03b2 supplementation in conjunction with antiviral drugs when available. Alternatively, IFN-\u03bb (Type III interferon) could be tested as recently proposed 34 , as the receptor is more specifically localized on epithelial cells, which may avoid potential systemic side effects with type I IFN. Conversely, inhibiting IFN production could be deleterious in these patients, reason why agents interfering with the IFN pathway, such as corticosteroids, anti-interferon antibody, JAK1/Tyk2 inhibitors or chloroquine, should be considered with great caution. Viral replication within the lungs in conjunction with an increased influx of innate immune cells mediates tissue damage and may fuel an auto-amplification inflammatory loop, potentially driven by NF\u03baB, and ultimately leading to ARDS and respiratory failure. Interestingly, virulent human coronaviruses have been shown to promote multiple form of necrotic cell death such as RIPK3-dependent necroptosis and caspase-1-dependent pyroptosis 35 . These pathways have also been implicated in influenza-induced ARDS in mice and humans 36,37 . Therefore, inflammatory cell death (e.g. necroptosis or pyroptosis) may represent an upstream driver of inflammation that could be targeted 38 .",
