Hypertension is the most common preexisting condition among COVID-19 patients and early reports note an association between hypertension and increased mortality. 1 Upregulation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) occurs in hypertensive patients and may promote inflammation and ensuing cytokine storm in COVID-19. 2 The spike glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2 gains entry into cells by binding to angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) on epithelial cells of the lungs, intestines and kidneys. Subsequent downregulation of surface ACE2 results in accumulation of angiotensin II (ANGII) with effects on vasoconstriction, inflammation and fibrosis. 2, 3 Pharmacologic inhibition of RAAS with ACE1 inhibitors and angiotensin-receptor blockers (ARBs) increase ACE2 expression and could be harmful or beneficial. 4 Given these concerns, physicians may be tempted to alter anti-hypertensive therapy during COVID-19, although abrupt withdrawal of RAAS inhibitors has been associated with cardiac instability in patients with cardiomyopathies. 5",

In the cohorts with a known outcome (discharge or death) the overall mortality appeared significantly increased at 35% (422/1216) for individuals with hypertension compared to 13% (140/1112) in COVID-19 patients without hypertension (p=0.0001). However, hypertension was more frequently observed in older populations. When adjusted for age, the effect of hypertension on mortality was diminished (table 1), with a reduction in odds-ratio [unadjusted OR 3.7, 95% CI (2.99-4.58) vs. adjusted OR 1.6, 95% CI (1.23-1.99)]. When additional factors (gender, ICU entry on day of admission, serum ferritin, insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus and cardiac arrhythmia history) are entered into a Cox proportional hazard model the effect of hypertension disappears. ACE1 inhibitors and ARBswere used in 22.8% and 18.0% of hypertensive patients with known outcomes. Treatment by RAAS inhibitors was not associated with detrimental effects and may be protective. The mortality rates were lower for hypertensive patients prescribed ACE1 (27%, p=0.001) or ARBs (33%, p=0.12) compared to other anti-hypertensive agents (39%) in the unadjusted analyses.RAAS inhibitor therapy appeared protective compared to other anti-hypertensive agents",
