Real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) targeting select genes of the SARS-CoV-2 RNA has been the main diagnostic tool in the global response to the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the diagnostic accuracy of the test has not been studied systematically outside of the laboratory setting. The aim of this study is to provide estimates of the diagnostic sensitivity and specificity of the RT-PCR test developed by China CDC. Methods. The study design is a secondary analysis of published findings on 1014 patients in Wuhan, China, of whom 601 tested positive and 413 were negative for COVID-19. Sensitivity and specificity were reconstructed using a Bayesian approach from probabilistic knowledge of the diagnostic errors. Predictive values of the test were calculated, resulting in estimates for the number of confirmatory tests that are needed for establishing the presence or absence of COVID-19, depending on the prior probability of a patient having the disease. Results. The sensitivity of the RT-PCR diagnostic test was estimated to be 0.777 (95% CI: 0.715, 0.849), while the specificity was 0.988 (95% CI: 0.933, 1.000). The confidence intervals include sampling error in addition to the error due to probabilistic knowledge of the data. Discussion. The Chinese version of the RT-PCR test had a conspicuous rate of false negative results, likely missing between 15% and 29% of patients with COVID-19. For a patient with a",

The disease associated with SARS-CoV-2 has been termed COVID-19 (1) . The publication of the SARS-CoV-2 genome (2) led to the rapid development in January 2020 of real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) tests for the diagnosis of COVID-19 while avoiding cross-reactions to other known coronaviruses. One version was developed in China that targeted the ORF1ab and N genes of viral RNA (3) while another version was developed in Germany that targeted the RdRp, E, and N genes (4). Real-time RT-PCR tests were developed and implemented thereafter by many laboratories around the world (5-7), even as COVID-19 became a global pandemic that continues to spread rapidly at this time.

However, the urgency of the pandemic has not allowed time for reliable and adequately powered clinical studies to be conducted to measure the diagnostic limitations of the RT-PCR test. At present, the bulk of knowledge about the sensitivity and specificity of RT-PCR is based on laboratory measurements that have goals related to the minimum threshold of detection of viral loads and the required number of thermal cycles of the chain reaction (9) . Some attention has been given to the viral distribution by physical location, such as the differences in positive rates of RT-PCR in nasopharyngeal versus oropharyngeal swabs, or in the sputum and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (10, 11) . Other factors that can impact the diagnostic success of RT-PCR include the timing of the test relative to disease onset, adequacy of the volume of fluids collected in the swab, and deviations from the laboratoryrecommended protocol under real-world conditions. In terms of clinical decision-making, any of the causes of failure of the test can lead to incorrect diagnoses due to false positives and false negatives. This issue has received media attention (12) and a recent editorial written by a professor of medicine in an influential US newspaper (13) urged physicians to beware of false negatives of diagnostic testing for COVID-19 while acknowledging that reliable data on rates of false negatives were not yet available.",

The study included 1014 patients suspected of having COVID-19 in Wuhan, China, who underwent RT-PCR and chest CT imaging diagnostic tests during a 30-day period in the months of January and February, 2020. The mean age was reported to be 51 \u00b115 years, and 46% were male. Throat swab samples were collected and the RT-PCR assays were reported to have used TaqMan One-Step RT-PCR kits from Shanghai Huirui Biotechnology Co., Ltd., or Shanghai BioGerm Medical Biotechnology Co., Ltd., both of which were reported to have been approved for use by China Food and Drug Administration. RT-PCR tests were positive for 601 patients (59.3%) and negative for the other 413 patients (40.7%). Although these tests were treated as the gold standard for comparison with chest CT imaging, the study authors provided valuable additional information. Patients who had negative RT-PCR tests but positive tests from chest CT were reassessed on the basis of clinical symptoms, CT features, and serial CT scans. The study staff concluded that among patients with negative RT-PCR tests, 147 could be classified as highly likely cases of COVID-19 and another 103 could be classified as probable cases of COVID-19. Moreover, among the 601 patients with positive RT-PCR tests, 21 patients were classified negative for COVID-19 from chest CT imaging. In this study, these 21 cases are assumed to have a low chance of being false positives, which is in alignment with the implicit assumption of the original study, indicated by their choice of RT-PCR as the reference for comparison with chest CT imaging. Apart from its role in the identification of probable false positives and negatives of RT-PCR, the chest CT imaging data is ignored in this study. In summary, the data are composed of firm knowledge of RT-PCR test results and probabilistic knowledge of the numbers of false positives and false negatives. The ranges and notations used for the true and false positives and negatives are presented in Table 1 .",

The distributions of n1 and n2 were estimated from the level of confidence expressed about false identifications. This procedure has similarities to fuzzy logic in which linguistic uncertainties about terms such as highly likely and probable are represented by membership functions (15) . Although it is motivated by fuzzy logic, the treatment used here is strictly based in probability theory. The starting point was an informative distribution defined on the probability space of a diagnostic error.

Uncertainty that arose from incomplete knowledge of the joint distributions of test results and disease status was quantified with a modified Bayesian analysis, along with the quantification of uncertainty due to sampling error. The results indicated that the RT-PCR test administered via throat swabs had a conspicuous rate of false negative results, likely missing between 15% and 29% of patients with COVID-19. For any patient who is suspected to have COVID-19 with higher than a roughly 1-in-5 chance, at least two confirmatory negative RT-PCR tests would be necessary to reduce the likelihood of disease below 5%. The limitation of the study findings is that they apply to one version of the RT-PCR diagnostic test for COVID-19 that was developed and distributed urgently by China CDC. Study findings may not generalize to other versions of the RT-PCR test that are being used in diverse geographic regions.",
