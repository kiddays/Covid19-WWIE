Since then, several countries went into lockdown. We estimate the effect of the lockdown in France on the contact rate and the effective reproduction number Re of the COVID-19. We obtain a reduction by a factor 7 (Re = 0.47, 95%-CI: 0.45-0.50), compared to the estimates carried out in France at the early stage of the epidemic. We also estimate the fraction of the population that would be infected by the beginning of May, at the official date at which the lockdown should be relaxed. We find a fraction of 3.7% (95%-CI: 3.0-4.8%) of the total French population, without taking into account the number of recovered individuals before April 1st, which is not known. This proportion is seemingly too low to reach herd immunity. Thus, even if the lockdown strongly mitigated the first epidemic wave, keeping a low value of Re is crucial to avoid an uncontrolled second wave (initiated with much more infectious cases than the first wave) and to hence avoid the saturation of hospital facilities. Our approach is based on the mechanistic-statistical formalism, which uses a probabilistic model to connect the data collection process and the latent epidemiological process, which is described by a SIR-type differential equation model.",

Several studies, mostly based on Chinese data, aimed at estimating the R 0 associated with the COVID-19 epidemic, leading to values from 1.4 to 6.49, with an average of 3.28 [4] . As the value of R 0 can be interpreted as the product of the contact rate and of the duration of the infectious period, and since the objective of the lockdown and associated restriction strategies are precisely to decrease the contact rate, an important effect on the number R e of secondary cases generated by an infectious individual is to be expected. This value R e is often referred to as 'effective reproduction number', and corresponds to the counterpart of R 0 in a population that is not fully susceptible [5] . If R e > 1, the number of infectious cases in the population follows an increasing trend, and the larger R e , the faster this trend. On the contrary, if R e < 1, the epidemic will gradually die out. The study [6] showed that containment policies in Hubei province indeed led to a subexponential growth in the number of cases, consistent with a decrease in the effective reproduction number R e .",

With these models, and more generally for most deterministic models based on differential equations, when the loss of observation due to the observation process is heavy, specific approaches have to be used to bridge the gap between the models and the data. One of these approaches is based on the mechanistic-statistical formalism, which uses a probabilistic model to connect the data collection process and the latent variable described by the ODE model. Milestone articles and textbook have been written about this approach or related approaches [9] , which is becoming standard in ecology [10, 11] . The application of this approach to human epidemiological data is still rare.",

Our primary objective was to assess the infection fatality ratio (IFR), defined as the number of deaths divided by the number of infected cases. As the number of people that have been infected is not known, this quantity cannot directly measured, even now (on April 15). The mechanistic-statistical framework allowed us to compute an IFR of 0.8% (95%-CI: 0.45-1.25%), which was consistent with previous findings in China (0.66%) and in the UK (0.9%) [13] and lower than the value previously computed on the Diamond Princess cruse ship data (1.3%) [14] . In this previous study, we also computed the R 0 in France, and we found a value of 3.2 (95%-CI: 3.1-3.3). Although the number of tests at that stage was low, an advantage of working with the data from the beginning of the epidemic was that the initial state of the epidemic was known.",

We obtained the number of positive cases and deaths in France, day by day from Sant\u00e9 Publique France [15] , from March 31 to April 14. We obtained weekly data on the number of individuals tested (in private laboratories and hospitals) from the same source. We assumed that during each of these weeks the number of tests per day was constant. This assumption is consistent with the small variations between the number of tests during the first week (111 690) and the second week of observation (132 392). As the data on the number of positive cases are not fully reliable (fewer cases during weekends with a rebound on Monday), we smoothed the data with a moving average over 5 days. Official data on the number of deaths by COVID-19 since the beginning of the epidemic in France only take into account hospitalised people. About 728 000 people in France live in nursing homes (EHPAD, source: DREES [16] ). The number of deaths in these structures has only been reported recently, and cannot be obtained day by day. Latest data from Sant\u00e9 Publique France indicate a total number of 10 643 deaths at hospital and 6 524 deaths in nursing homes by April 15. The total number of deaths therefore corresponds to about 1.6 times the number of deaths at hospital. The same factor had been estimated in [12] based on local dataset in the French Grand Est region.",

The parameter \u03b1 is the contact rate (to be estimated) and 1/\u03b2 is the mean time until an infectious becomes recovered. Based on the results in [17] , the median period of viral shedding is 20 days, but the infectiousness tends to decay before the end of this period: the results in [18] show that infectiousness starts from 2.5 days before symptom onset and declines within 7 days of illness onset. Based on these observations we assume here that 1/\u03b2 = 10 days. The parameter \u03b3 corresponds to the death rate of the infectious (to be estimated).",

We fixed D(t 0 ) = 3523, the number of deaths at hospital by March 31. The initial S population at the beginning of the period, should still be close to the total French population: by March 31 only 52 128 cases had been observed in France, corresponding to 0.08% of the total population. A factor 8 had been estimated in [12] between the cumulated number of observed cases and the actual number of cases at the beginning of the epidemic.

The cumulated number of infected cases that we obtained by May 10 (I + R) corresponds to a fraction of 3.7% (95%-CI: 3.0-4.8%) of the total French population, without taking into account the number of recovered individuals before April 1st, which is not known. Based on a value R 0 = 3.2, the herd immunity threshold, corresponding to the minimum fraction of the population that must have immunity to stop the epidemic, would be 1 \u2212 1/R 0 \u2248 69% (a threshold of 80% was proposed in [22] ). This proportion will probably not be reached by May 10. As emphasised by [23] , a too fast relaxation of the lockdown-related restrictions before herd immunity is reached or efficient prophylaxis is developed), would expose the population to an uncontrolled second wave of infection. In the worstcase scenario, the effective reproduction number R e would approach the initially estimated value of R 0 , and the second wave would start with about 1.6 \u00b7 10 5 infectious individuals (in comparison with the few cases that initiated the first wave in France) and about 64 \u00b7 10 6 susceptible individuals.
