            "text": "We have also investigated the role of aerosol in spreading the pandemic across India because it's possible airborne nature. For this, we have investigated the association of aerosols (AOD) and other pollutions (NO 2 ) with COVID-19 cases during the study period and also during the first lockdown period (25 March-15 April) in India. We found a negative association in March when there were few cases, but in April, it shows positive association when the number of cases is more (for AOD it was r=-0.41 and r=0.28 respectively). During the lockdown period, aerosols (AOD) and other pollutants (NO 2 ; an indicator of PM 2.5 ) reduced sharply with a percentage drop of about 36 and 37, respectively. This reduction may have reduced the risk for COVID-19 through air transmission due to the unavailability of aerosol particles as a base. HYSPLIT forward trajectory model also shows that surface aerosols may travel up to 4 km according to wind and direction within three h of its generation. If coronavirus becomes airborne as suggested by many studies, then it may have a higher risk of transmission by aerosols particles. So relaxing in the lockdown and environmental rules in terms of pollutant emissions from power plants, factories, and other facilities would be a wrong choice and could result in more COVID-19 incidences and deaths in India. Therefore the current study, although limited, suggests that it is doubtful that the spread of COVID-19 would slow down in India due to meteorological factors, like high temperature and high humidity. Because a large number of cases have already been reported in the range of high Tem, high Relative, and high absolute humidity regions of India. Thus our results in no way suggest that COVID-19 would not spread in warm, humid regions or during summer/monsoon. So effective public health interventions should be implemented across India to slow down the transmission of COVID-19. If COVID-19 is indeed sensitive to environmental factors, it could be tested in the coming summer-monsoon for India. So the only summer is not going to help India until monsoon is coming. Only government mitigations strategies would be helpful, whether its lockdown, aggressive and strategic testing, medical facilities, imposing social distancing, encouraging to use face mask or monitoring by a mobile application (Aarogya Setu).

Warm and humid (high absolute humidity) environments see attenuated viral transmission like influenza and SARS (Schoeman and Fielding, 2019) . As this coronavirus appeared for the first time and was highly contagious, it poses a great challenge to diagnosis and prevention and control. Human coronaviruses have been associated with a wide spectrum of respiratory diseases in different studies and belong to the Coronaviridae family (Bukhari and Jameel, 2020; Weiss and Navas-Martin, 2005) . It has been suggested that flu viruses are not easily transmitted in hot and humid conditions. Similar comments about the COVID-19 have repeatedly been made by health officials as well as world leaders that the outbreak will slow down by summer, due to decreased transmissivity (Bukhari and Jameel, 2020) . also found a similar result in his model study. They suggested that during the coming summer in the northern hemisphere, the spread of Coronavirus will be reduced in tropical regions. It is also important to note that SARS-Cov, which is a type of coronavirus, loses its ability to survive in higher temperatures, which may be due to the breakdown of their lipid layer at higher temperatures (Schoeman and Fielding, 2019) . However, no seasonality has been established for COVID-19.",

Bu et al., (2020) found from a global perspective, cities with a mean temperature below 24 \u00b0C are all high-risk cities for 2019-nCoV transmission before June. In our case, it is not true as in India; the temperature was always high when the COVID-19 growth rate is high. Few studies supporting the hypothesis that high temp and high humidity will reduce the case like, Wang et al., (2020) find in their study, under a linear regression framework, high temperature and high humidity significantly reduces the transmission of COVID-19. They reported that a onedegree Celsius increase in temperature and a one percent increase in relative humidity lower R by 0.0225 and 0.0158, respectively. The transmission of coronaviruses can be affected by several factors, including climate conditions (such as temperature and humidity), population density, and medical care quality . Therefore, understanding the relationship between weather and the transmission of COVID-19 is the key to forecast the intensity and end time of this pandemic.",

They also speculated that from February to the end of May 2020, the areas ranging the temperature (13 \u2103 -24 \u2103) are all key areas for disease prevention, especially densely populated cities; from June and after that, the disease in regions with a mean temperature over 24 \u00b0C will begin to subside. They suggested before June 2020, cities with a global average temperature below 24 \u00b0C are all under high-risk of the transmission of new coronaviruses. After June, the risk of disease transmission will be significantly reduced in the cities with a mean temperature reaching 24 \u00b0C or higher. Our results for the Indian case did not match with the hypothesis said above as average temperature for the Indian region for March and April is above 24\u00b0C, even the COVID-19 cases are increasing rapidly in India even though restrict lockdown is there.",

These studies suggest that COVID-19 may be airborne and can give a high risk of transmission through aerosols. Aerosols are particles formed by solid or liquid particles dispersed and suspended in the air. They contain soil particles, industrial dust particles, particulates emitted by automobiles, bacteria, microorganisms, plant spore powders, and other components. When a person who was infected with the virus, coughs, sneezes, breathes vigorously, or speaks loudly, the virus will be excreted from the body. It may dissolve with the aerosol and become the bio-aerosols. Bio-aerosols ranging in size from 1.0 to 5.0 \u03bcm generally remain in the air, whereas larger particles are deposited on surfaces. Droplets spread in the space of about 1 to 2 m from the source of infection. However, aerosol can travel hundreds of meters or more. Wang and Du (2020) , in his many case studies of COVID-19, speculated that the spread of the virus might be due to the aerosols because new patients in Inner Mongolia and Wuhan were never in direct contact with the confirmed cases. They found that COVID-19 may transmit through aerosol directly, but it needs to be further verified by experiments. If the aerosols can spread COVID-19, prevention and control will be much more difficult. Many of the information regarding 2019-nCoV are still emerging, such as the virus being airborne for more than 3 hours and having very different survival times on metals, cardboards and plastics (van Doremalen et al., 2020) . Doremalen et al., (2020) found in his experiment that the COVID-19 virus can remain viable in aerosols throughout his experiment (3 hours), similar to that observed with SARS-CoV-1. Santarpia et al., (2020) in their clinical study found that SARS-CoV-2 is shed during respiration, toileting, and fomite contact, indicating that infection may occur in both direct and indirect (through aerosols) contact. Although this study did not employ any size-fractionation techniques to determine the size range of SARS-CoV-2 droplets and particles, the data was suggestive that viral aerosol particles are produced by individuals that have the COVID-19 disease, even in the absence of cough. Therefore the COVID-19 may spread through the aerosols if the sufficient amount of aerosols is present in the environment. Also, the reduction in aerosol concentration during the lockdown may reduce the risk of transmission of COVID-19 through aerosols.",

This lockdown surely has positive feedback by less daily new COVID cases compared to Europe and the USA and also affect the environment. Due to the strict lockdown in India, all public transport, industries, and individual activities were shut, which was reflected in air quality and aerosols over India. The aerosols decrease sharply over India in comparison with the average value of AOD of the last three years (Fig. 5) . We have found a clear decrease in AOD value from the first day of lockdown with little increase in value in the coming days due to some relaxation in lockdown. Also, April month is harvest month so, aerosols are increased due to harvesting and crop residue burning in the April month, which can also be seen in averaged data. Now the first 21 days lockdown (25 March-15April) period is over, and the second lockdown (15 April-3 May) is going on but with some relaxation in few important activities, so It may increase the aerosol concentration. If a lockdown is followed strictly till May 3, 2020, then a big reduction in AOD may be observed, which may restrict the risk of further new COVID-19 cases by its transmission through aerosols.",

However, more new cases were recorded in regions with a temperature between 16 and 18 o C in March even more up to 30 o C in India during March and April 2020, which is now challenging the hypothesis that a rise in temperature would minimize the spread of the 2019-nCoV. Nonetheless, the observation of more than 10,000 cases in the last ten days in India makes it clear that the effect of rising summer temperature, if any, would not be observed in the current hotspot of India, as the mean temperature for most of the major cities in India is above 30 o C for most of April and May. Indeed, laboratory experiments performed between 21-23 o C at a relative humidity of 40%, showed that the virus survived for several days on plastics and metals (van Doremalen et al., 2020) . Therefore temperature may affect similar to the relationship observed between SARS-CoV and temperature (Bukhari and Jameel, 2020) .",

However, any infectious disease origins and spread occur only when affected by certain natural and social factors through acting on the source of infection, the mode of transmission, and the susceptibility of the population. The weather and meteorological factors also may play a part in the coronavirus outbreak besides the social factors. Also, aerosols may play a crucial role during the spread of COVID-19.

We found a positive association between daily new cases of COVID-19 with temperature for India. Relative humidity and Absolute humidity is negatively associated with daily cases of COVID-19 in India. We found a positive correlation (Pearson's r =0.56) between temperature and daily COVID-19 cases over India.

Two coastal states of India (Kerala and Maharashtra) are the example for rest of the India who has an almost same meteorological environment and had same numbers of COVID-19 patient on 29 th March, but during first lockdown period, their governments' strategies made a big difference as now Kerala is on 11 th position, and Maharashtra is at the top in the total number of COVID-19 patient in India (Fig.1). 3. There is a thin hope that increasing temperature in coming months in India may reduce the number of new COVID-19 cases, because in India during summer, crop residue burning and major dust storms occur (Kumar et al., 2015) , which further will degrade the air quality especially in the north Indian region and will create the health emergency by producing respiratory diesis due to increased particulate matter, ultimately which may enhance the number of death of patient suffering from the COVID-19, also will increase the chance of spreading through aerosols. 4. We also investigated the aerosols and pollutants behavior with the total number of cases during the COVID-19 outbreak. The concentration in aerosols (AOD) and other pollutants (NO 2 ) was sharply reduced during the first lockdown period (25 March-15 April) in India, which may have a negative effect and lowered the risk of COVID-19 to be airborne because less available aerosols as the base for the virus to stick on it. 5. Since many earlier studies and our findings are suggesting that COVID-19 may be airborne, so to slow down its spread, governments should impose strict lockdown and motivate the society to follow the social distancing, thermal scanning, and wearing a face mask when going outside. Health workers and those are working at the front line must take precautions as it may be airborne. Also, the mild infected and the severely infected patient should be kept in a separate medical facility.",

Relaxing in the lockdown and environmental rules in terms of pollutant emissions from power plants, factories, and other facilities would be the wrong choice. It could increase pollutants like PM2.5, which may result in more COVID-19 incidences and deaths in India. There is a need for a more appropriate study of the rate of outdoor transmission versus indoor and direct versus indirect transmission as they are not well understood, and environmental-related impacts are mostly applicable to outdoor transmissions.",
