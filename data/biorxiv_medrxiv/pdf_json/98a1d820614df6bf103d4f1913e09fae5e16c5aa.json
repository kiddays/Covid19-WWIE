            "text": "The COVID-19 pandemic has stressed healthcare care systems throughout the world. Understanding clinical progression of cases is a key public health priority that informs optimal resource allocation during an emergency. Using data from Shenzhen, China, where all cases were monitored in hospital and symptom profiles and clinical and lab results were available starting from early stages of clinical course, we characterized clinical progression of COVID-19 cases and determined important predictors for faster clinical progression to key clinical events and longer use of medical resources. Epidemiological, demographic, laboratory, clinical, and outcome data were extracted from electronic medical records. We found that those who progressed to the severe stage, developed acute respiratory distress syndrome, and were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) progressed on average 9.5 days (95%CI 8.7,10.3), 11.0 days (95%CI 9.7,12.3), and 10.5 days (95%CI 8.2,13.3) after symptom onset, respectively. We estimated that patients who were admitted to ICUs remained there for an average of 34.4 days (95%CI 24.1,43.2) and the average time on a ventilator was 28.5 days (95%CI 20.0,39.1) among those requiring mechanical ventilation. The median length of hospital stay was 21.3 days (95%CI, 20.5, 22.2) for the mild or moderate cases who did not progress to the severe stage, but increased to 52.1 days (95%CI, 43.3, 59.5) for those who required ICU admission. Clear characterization of clinical progression informs planning for healthcare resource allocation during COVID-19 outbreaks and provides a basis that helps assess the effectiveness of new treatment and therapeutics.",

Because all clinically confirmed cases, including a sizable portion detected through contact tracing, were required to be hospitalized for isolation purposes regardless of their clinical presentation and symptom profile, this dataset allows us to examine clinical progression of cases without the considerable selection bias typically seen in hospital-based studies. We estimate time from symptom onset to key clinical events, such as first clinical diagnosis, progression to severe clinical stages, development of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), admission to the critical care unit (ICU), and discharge. We also estimate duration hospitalized, in the ICU, and on ventilators. We determine the key predictors of faster clinical progression to a series of clinical events and longer use of healthcare resources.",

Differences in baseline comorbidities between older males and females did not explain the disparity; after adjusting for having any underlying comorbidity, the subdistribution hazard ratio remained unchanged (Table S1) .

Therefore, our results provide a clear picture of the composition of cases in a city in terms of disease severity and the clinical trajectories of these cases. Although healthcare resources in Shenzhen were rarely overwhelmed by influx of COVID-19 patients, we show that the trajectory of clinical progression of cases in Shenzhen were similar to the trajectory in Wuhan, China, with mean time to ICU admission and mean time to developing acute respiratory distress syndrome to be around 10 days 3, 4 . Patient characteristics previously reported to be associated with ARDS and death 5 including hypertension, diabetes, and various lab results were also highly predictive of faster clinical progression to various key clinical events including progression to severe stage, ARDS, and ICU admission. Previous studies reported that most cases were males and median age was over 45 3,6 and a higher percentage of men required ICU care 3 . We further show differences in clinical progression between males and females that were primarily driven by the stark difference in the older age group independent of differences in baseline comorbidities.",

When the date of symptom onset could not be determined, we assumed onset date was the date of initial diagnosis. We performed sensitivity analyses to assess patient characteristics for clinical progression to severe stage and ICU admission and the results remained qualitatively the same (Table S4) . We also performed the RSF analyses using symptom profile and lab results within 5 days of initial diagnosis as candidate predictors, and the integrated AUC remained relatively unchanged ( Figure S9 ). Our estimates of duration of ICU stay and ventilator use were somewhat imprecise, likely due to the small sample size for those reaching the critical stage. Even though estimating duration using our non-parametric approach showed improvement in precision compared to times estimated using parametric accelerated failure time models, the estimated time within subgroups needs to be interpreted with caution because of the small sample size (Table S3) . Finally, the association presented between clinical progression and patient characteristics should not be interpreted as causal given the variation in treatment and numerous confounders that were not accounted for in this study.",

However, this is an important first step towards an applicable triage risk screening tool once well recorded data on clinical courses for more patients become available.
