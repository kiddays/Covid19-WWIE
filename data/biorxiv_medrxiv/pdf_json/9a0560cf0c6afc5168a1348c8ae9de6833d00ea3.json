            "text": "SARS-CoV-2, a member of the coronavirus family, is responsible for the current COVID-19 worldwide pandemic. We previously demonstrated that five nucleotide analogues inhibit the SARS-CoV-2 RNAdependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), including the active triphosphate forms of Sofosbuvir, Alovudine, Zidovudine, Tenofovir alafenamide and Emtricitabine. We report here the evaluation of a library of additional nucleoside triphosphate analogues with a variety of structural and chemical features as inhibitors of the RdRps of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2. These features include modifications on the sugar (2' or 3' modifications, carbocyclic, acyclic, or dideoxynucleotides) or on the base. The goal is to identify nucleotide analogues that not only terminate RNA synthesis catalyzed by these coronavirus RdRps, but also have the potential to resist the viruses' exonuclease activity. We examined these nucleotide analogues with regard to their ability to be incorporated by the RdRps in the polymerase reaction and then prevent further incorporation. While all 11 molecules tested displayed incorporation, 6 exhibited immediate termination of the polymerase reaction (Carbovir triphosphate, Ganciclovir triphosphate, Stavudine triphosphate, Entecavir triphosphate, 3'-O-methyl UTP and Biotin-16-dUTP), 2 showed delayed termination (Cidofovir diphosphate and 2'-O-methyl UTP), and 3 did not terminate the polymerase reaction (2'-fluoro-dUTP, 2'-amino-dUTP and Desthiobiotin-16-UTP). The coronavirus genomes encode an exonuclease that apparently requires a 2'-OH group to excise mismatched bases at the 3'-terminus. In this study, all of the nucleoside triphosphate analogues we evaluated form Watson-Cricklike base pairs. All the nucleotide analogues which demonstrated termination either lack a 2'-OH, have a blocked 2'-OH, or show delayed termination. These nucleotides may thus have the potential to resist exonuclease activity, a property that we will investigate in the future. Furthermore, prodrugs of five of these nucleotide analogues (Brincidofovir/Cidofovir, Abacavir, Valganciclovir/Ganciclovir, Stavudine and Entecavir) are FDA approved for other viral infections, and their safety profile is well known. Thus, they can be evaluated rapidly as potential therapies for COVID-19.",

The RdRp of coronaviruses is a well established drug target; the active site of the RdRp is highly conserved among positive-sense RNA viruses (te Velthuis 2014). These RdRps have low fidelity (Selisko et al. 2018) , allowing them to recognize a variety of modified nucleotide analogues as substrates. Such nucleotide analogues may inhibit further RNA-polymerase catalyzed RNA replication making them important candidate anti-viral agents (McKenna et al. 1989; \u00d6berg 2006; Eltahla et al. 2015; De Clercq and Li 2016) . RdRps in SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 have nearly identical sequences (Elfiky 2020) ; recently, the SARS-CoV-2 RdRp was cloned (Chien et al. 2020 ) and the RNA polymerase complex structure was determined (Gao et al. 2020 ), which will help guide the design and study of RdRp inhibitors.",

In this work, we evaluate additional nucleotide analogues with a larger variety of modifications to identify those with more efficient termination, as well as the ability to resist the virus's proofreading function. These additional nucleotide analogues were selected based on one or more of the following criteria. First, they have structural and chemical properties such as (a) similarity in size and structure to natural nucleotides, including the ability to fit within the active site of the polymerase, (b) presence of modifications at the 3'-OH position or absence of a 3'-OH group resulting in obligate termination of the polymerase reaction; or (c) modifications at the 2' or other positions on the sugar or base that can delay termination. The above criteria will provide structural and chemical features that we can explore to evade exonuclease activity (Minskaia et al. 2006) . Second, if they have previously been shown to inhibit the polymerases of other viruses, they may also have the potential to inhibit the SARS-CoV-2 polymerase based on our previous work. Third, ideally, the inhibitors should display high selectivity for viral polymerases relative to cellular DNA or RNA polymerases. And fourth, there is an advantage in considering nucleotide analogues that are the active triphosphate forms of FDA-approved drugs, as these drugs are known to have acceptable levels of toxicity and are more likely to be tolerated by patients with coronavirus infections, including COVID-19.",

Interestingly, it has been shown using vaccinia virus DNA polymerase, that though Cid-DP is incorporated into DNA in the polymerase reaction, the process is relatively inefficient, and termination of synthesis occurs after extension by an additional nucleotide, a delayed termination similar to that shown for Remdesivir for RdRp; in the penultimate position, the incorporated Cidofovir is not removed by 3'-exonuclease activity and resistance is not common for Cidofovir (Magee et al. 2005) .",

            "text": "In contrast to many other RNA viruses, the SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 coronaviruses have very large genomes that encode a 3'-5' exonuclease (nsp14) involved in proofreading (Shannon et al. 2020; Ma et al. 2015) , the activity of which is enhanced by the cofactor nsp10 (Bouvet et al. 2012 ). This proofreading function increases replication fidelity by removing mismatched nucleotides . Mutations in nsp14 lead to reduced replication fidelity of the viral genome (Eckerle et al. 2010) . Interestingly, while the nsp14/nsp10 complex efficiently excises single mismatched nucleotides at the 3' end of the RNA chain, it is not able to remove longer stretches of unpaired nucleotides or 3' modified RNA (Bouvet et al. 2012) . In order for the nucleotide analogues to be successful inhibitors of these viruses, they need to overcome this proofreading function. The coronavirus exonuclease activity typically requires the presence of a 2'-OH group at the 3' end of the growing RNA strand (Minskaia et al. 2006 ). However, if there is delayed termination and the offending nucleotide analogue is no longer at the 3' end, they will also not be removed by the exonuclease (Bouvet et al. 2012; Gordon et al. 2020a; 2020b) . Nearly all of the nucleotide analogues we selected lack the 2'-OH group, have modifications that block the 2'-OH group on the sugar, or are acyclic nucleotide derivatives; such nucleotides will not likely be substrates for viral exonucleases.",

The prodrugs of these molecules are shown in Figs. 2 and S1. The phosphoramidate forms of prodrugs can be readily synthesized using the ProTide approach (Alanazi et al. 2019) . The RdRp of these coronaviruses, referred to as nsp12, and its two protein cofactors, nsp7 and nsp8, have been shown to be required for the processive polymerase activity of nsp12 in SARS-CoV (Subissi et al. 2014; Kirchdoerfer and Ward 2019) . These three components of each coronavirus polymerase complex were cloned and purified as described previously (Kirchdoerfer and Ward 2019; Chien et al. 2020) . We then performed polymerase extension assays with 2'-O-methyluridine triphosphate (2'-OMe-UTP), 3'-O-methyluridine 5'-triphosphate (3'-OMe-UTP), 2'fluoro-2'-deoxyuridine triphosphate (2'-F-dUTP), 2'-amino-2'-deoxyuridine triphosphate (2'-NH 2 -dUTP), biotin-16-dUTP (Biotin-UTP), desthiobiotin-16-UTP (DBiotin-UTP), Stavudine-TP (Sta-TP), Cidofovir diphosphate (Cid-DP) + UTP + ATP, Carbovir triphosphate (Car-TP) + UTP + ATP + CTP, Ganciclovir 5'-triphosphate (Gan-TP) + UTP + ATP + CTP, or Entecavir triphosphate (Ent-TP) + UTP + ATP + CTP, following the addition of a pre-annealed RNA template and primer to a pre-assembled mixture of the SARS-CoV and/or SARS-CoV-2 RdRp (nsp12) and the two cofactor proteins (nsp7 and nsp8). We also used combinations of nucleotide analogues in some cases to perform the polymerase reaction. The polymerase reaction products were analyzed by MALDI-TOF-MS. The sequences of the RNA template and primer used for the polymerase extension assay, which correspond to the 3' end of the SARS-CoV-2 genome, are indicated at the top of Figs. 3-5 and S2-S8.",

If they do not serve as terminators, two base extension by the UTP or TTP analogue will be observed. In the case of Cid-DP which is a CTP analogue, UTP and ATP must be provided to allow extension to the point where there is a G in the template strand. If the Cid-DP is then incorporated and acts as a terminator, extension will stop; otherwise, additional incorporation events may be observed. Similarly, for Carbovir-TP, Ganciclovir-TP, and Entecavir-TP, all of which are GTP analogues, UTP, ATP and CTP must be provided to allow extension to the point where there is a C in the template strand. If Car-TP, Gan-TP or Ent-TP is incorporated and acts as a terminator, extension will stop; otherwise additional incorporation events may be observed.

In the case of extension with 2'-OMe-UTP, MS peaks representing incorporation by one 2'-OMe-UTP (6638 Da observed, 6632 Da expected) and to a lesser extent two 2'-OMe-UTPs (6944 Da observed, 6952 Da expected) were observed. Thus, 2'-OMe-UTP shows significant termination upon incorporation, indicating it can be a potential drug lead. 2'-O-methyl modification of RNA occurs naturally and therefore should have relatively low toxicity. In addition, ribose-2'-O-methylated RNA resists viral exonuclease activity (Minskaia et al. 2006) . For Sta-TP, a single incorporation peak (6603 Da observed, 6598 Da expected) was seen, indicating that Sta-TP is very efficiently incorporated and achieves complete termination of the polymerase reaction. Since this molecule is a dideoxynucleotide without any hydroxyl groups on the sugar moiety, it may resist exonuclease activity. In the case of Biotin-dUTP, a single incorporation peak was evident (7090 Da observed, 7082 Da expected), suggesting that Biotin-dUTP is also a terminator of the polymerase reaction under these conditions. This indicates that the presence of a modification on the base along with the absence of a 2'-OH group in this nucleotide analogue leads to termination of the polymerase reaction catalyzed by the SARS-CoV-2 RdRp. The polymerase extension reaction was performed by incubating Cid-DP, UTP and ATP with preassembled SARS-CoV-2 polymerase (nsp12, nsp7 and nsp8), the indicated RNA template and primer, and the appropriate reaction buffer, followed by detection of reaction products by MALDI-TOF MS.

There is no further extension beyond this position, indicative of delayed termination by Cid-DP. A small intermediate peak was also observed indicating extension by an ATP at the 9 th position from the initial priming site following the first Cid-DP incorporation (9142 Da observed, 9138 Da expected). A small partial UTP extension peak (6623 Da observed, 6618 Da expected) was also observed. An essentially identical result was obtained with the SARS-CoV polymerase (Fig. S2) . Delayed termination for Cid-DP has been described for a vaccinia virus DNA polymerase (Magee et al. 2005) . The investigational drug Remdesivir, currently being tested on COVID-19 patients, also displays delayed termination (Gordon et al. 2020a; 2020b) ; this is a major factor in its ability to resist the nsp14 3'-5' exonuclease activity. Similar resistance to this exonuclease therefore will likely also occur with Cidofovir due to delayed termination of the polymerase reaction.

In each case, extension to the first C position on the template occurs and further extension is blocked in the presence of ATP, UTP and CTP. In more detail, for Car-TP, the major peak observed indicates extension by UTP, ATP and CTP followed by complete termination with a Car-TP (10436 Da observed, 10430 Da expected). In addition, partial extension peaks were seen indicating a single UTP incorporation (6621 Da observed, 6618 Da expected) and extension up to but not including the Car-TP (10123 Da observed, 10121 Da expected). For Ent-TP, a peak was observed indicating extension by UTP, ATP and CTP followed by complete termination by a single Ent-TP (10458 Da observed, 10460 Da expected). Additional peaks are seen representing a single UTP extension (6628 Da observed, 6618 Da expected), and a major peak indicating extension up to but not including the Ent-TP (10129 Da observed, 10121 Da expected). And for Gan-TP, a major peak observed indicated extension by UTP, ATP and CTP followed by complete termination with Gan-TP (10441 Da observed, 10438 Da expected). A small peak representing extension up to but not including Gan-TP (10123 Da observed, 10121 Da expected) was also seen. Similar results were obtained for Car-TP and Gan-TP using the SARS-CoV polymerase (Fig. S3) . Both Car-TP and Ent-TP are carbocyclic nucleotides. Car-TP lacks the 2'-and 3'-OH groups, while Ent-TP lacks the 2'-OH group. Gan-TP is an acyclic nucleotide having an OH group but lacking a ribose ring. All three thus may resist the viral exonuclease activity. These results also indicate that Car-TP and Gan-TP are better terminators than Ent-TP; their prodrugs can be evaluated as therapeutics for COVID-19 and SARS. Fig. S4 shows a side-by-side comparison of the results with 2'-OMe-UTP and 3'-OMe-UTP using the SARS-CoV polymerase. The results for 2'-OMe-UTP are practically identical to those with SARS-CoV-2 in Fig. 4a , indicating that 2'-OMe-UTP exhibits significant polymerase reaction termination. The 3'-OMe-UTP results are consistent with its being an obligate terminator, but with lower incorporation efficiency, represented by a small single-incorporation peak (6625 Da observed, 6632 Da expected).",

            "text": "The results for DBiotin-UTP are presented in Fig. S6 . DBiotin-UTP incorporation complementary to each A in the template is observed, just like a UTP. Thus, this nucleotide is incorporated and does not terminate the polymerase reaction. These results indicate that modification on the base of the UTP does not affect its incorporation activity by SARS-CoV-2 RdRp. Fig. S7 presents the results of an experiment where both 2'-OMe-UTP and dUTP were added together at the same concentration. The major peak occurred at 6930 Da (6922 Da expected) representing incorporation by both dUTP and 2'-OMe-UTP in adjacent positions. In addition, some partial extension peaks of a single 2'-OMe-UTP (6626 Da observed, 6632 Da expected) and two dUTPs (6900 Da observed, 6892 Da expected) were found. The incorporation of a dUTP, a 2'-OMe-UTP, both of which lack a 2'-OH group, or their combination would enable them to potentially resist the nsp14 3'-5' exonuclease activity. Fig. S8 shows three mass spectra of the polymerase reaction products using equimolar combinations of nucleotide analogues, (a) biotin-dUTP, dUTP, and UTP, (b) 2'-F-dUTP, 2'-OMe-UTP and dUTP, and (c) 2'-NH 2 -dUTP, 2'-OMe-UTP and dUTP, to determine their relative incorporation efficiencies. Based on the results shown in Fig. S8a , biotin-dUTP and dUTP have lower incorporation efficiency than the natural UTP for SARS-CoV-2 RdRp, since peaks are only observed for UTP extension, either one UTP (6620 Da observed, 6618 Da expected) or two UTPs (6928 Da observed, 6924 Da expected). In Fig. S8b , it is seen that 2'-F-dUTP is incorporated far better than 2'-OMe-UTP and dUTP, with the only evident peaks in the spectrum at 6620 Da (6620 Da expected) for extension by one 2'-F-dUTP, and at 6928 Da (6928 Da expected) for extension by two 2'-F-dUTPs. Finally, as shown in Fig. S8c , 2'-NH 2 -dUTP is more efficiently incorporated than 2'-OMe-UTP and dUTP as revealed by the presence of evident peaks only at 6623 Da (6617 Da expected) for extension by one 2'-NH 2 -dUTP and at 6929 Da (6922 Da expected) for extension by two 2'-NH 2 -dUTPs. The results indicate that 2'-F-dUTP and 2'-NH 2 -dUTP behave like UTP, and are not terminators of the polymerase reaction. Neither 2'-F-dUTP nor 2'-NH 2 -dUTP have a free 2'-OH group. It remains to be seen whether the RNAs produced by these two nucleotide analogues will resist exonuclease activity. If that is the case, they may be considered for use in combination with nucleotide analogues that are efficient terminators but sensitive to exonuclease for COVID-19 therapeutic purposes.",

Their prodrug versions (shown in Fig. 2 and S1) are available or can be readily synthesized using the ProTide approach (Alanazi et al. 2019) . The prodrugs of several of these nucleoside triphosphate analogues (Ganciclovir/Valganciclovir, Cidofovir/Brincidofovir, Abacavir, Stavudine, and Entecavir) have been FDA approved for treatment of other viral infections and their toxicity profile is well established. Thus, our results provide a molecular basis for further evaluation of these prodrugs in SARS-CoV-2 virus inhibition and animal models to test their efficacy for the development of potential COVID-19 therapeutics.
