A number of forecasting models have been developed and widely shared to help health care facilities and governments predict upcoming patient surges and plan accordingly 1, 2 . These models take in a myriad of inputs including population demographics, currently admitted patients, case doubling times, and the rate at which positive cases turn into hospitalizations, among other inputs 1 , 3 , 4 , 5 . While there are enough models, guidance and data to provide accurate inputs to these models remain lacking [6] [7] [8] . Currently, 95% of Americans have been asked to stay at home. Schools, businesses and community gathering activities have been closed or curtailed and plans of reopening hinge on demonstrated sustained reduction in cases, availability of testing, and enough health system capacity to treat patients requiring hospitalization without resorting to crisis standards of care 9, 10 . The need to accurately plan health system capacity is one of the six indicators cited to guide the state of California's decision making around reopening the state's economy 11 . An important first step is taking stock of the currently available hospitalization and testing data and how it has evolved as the pandemic progresses.",

If most new cases are younger, the corresponding need for hospitalizations will also be lower. Over the course of five weeks, we did not find a significant change in the age distribution of patients presenting with influenza like illness (ILI) and tested for COVID-19, however we did find a significant shift towards younger patients in those testing positive for COVID-19. The simplest explanation for the shift towards younger patients testing positive could be relaxing testing criteria. For example, guidelines at our institution went from requiring ILI symptoms and a known COVID-19 exposure, to expressing symptoms consistent with ILI, to medical doctor discretion. However, this does not explain why there is no change in the demographics of patients getting tested for COVID-19. A more plausible explanation is that because of the SIP order, the at-risk elderly population is protected and hence less likely to contract COVID-19. This interpretation is supported by the fact that despite seeing a larger number of younger COVID-19 positive patients, those that need to be admitted have similar ages, rate of ICU admission, and length of stay as before the SIP order; now we see fewer absolute numbers of such cases.",

We analyzed the fraction of tested patients that were confirmed positive for COVID-19, the fraction of those needing hospitalization, and the fraction requiring ICU admission over the 40 days between March 2nd and April 11th 2020. Data were obtained from a combination of two sources: a daily-refreshed snapshot of the health system's Enterprise Data Warehouse (EDW) and a twice-daily refreshed extract of all RT-PCR laboratory tests for SARS-CoV-2 at Stanford. Access to a view of the EDW was set up last year as part of Stanford Medicine's Program for Artificial Intelligence in Healthcare 12 .
