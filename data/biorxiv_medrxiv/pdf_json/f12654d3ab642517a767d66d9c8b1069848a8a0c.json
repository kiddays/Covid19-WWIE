An early, simple, and clinically relevant model to predict survival in hospitalized COVID-19 patients brings objectivity to emotionally fraught decisions and conversations with patients and families. There have been no published multivariate models predicting survival in larger cohorts (>100) of patients with COVID-19 for at the time of this study, although reports from China have identified age, Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score, and d-dimer level as potential predictors. 8 Our objectives were to use parameters available early to clinicians to characterize and predict survival for hospitalized COVID-19 patients within the largest health system in New York By including an L 1 -norm regularization term that promotes sparsity, LASSO regression is well suited for determining the optimal subset of measurements. The magnitudes of the coefficients relate to the predictive values of the normalized measurements while coefficients of non-predictive measurements converge exactly to 0.",

We also restricted inputs to commonly collected, discrete, and objective data. Its sheer simplicity and reliance on quantitative measurements makes it generalizable and easy to deploy to all interested stakeholders, including front-line providers and hospital administrators organizing distribution of scarce and limited resources. While we present the calculator output as a probability score, a specific operating point can also be chosen to provide a binary outcome prediction with significant accuracy.
