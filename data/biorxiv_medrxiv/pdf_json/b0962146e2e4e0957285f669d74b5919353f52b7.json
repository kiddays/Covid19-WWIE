Per capita income for each zone was linked to each notified case based on residential address.

The associations between the outcome and independent variables were reported as adjusted odds ratios (AOR) with 95% confidence intervals and likelihood ratio test (LRT) using the univariate and multivariate logistic regression models.

We showed that patients with pre-existing cardiovascular diseases/hypertension were at increased risk of hospitalization. The prevalence of at least one comorbid condition among infected individuals in Brazil was similar to that reported in China (12.5% vs. 10.5%) 23 . Previous studies suggest that persons with underlying health conditions, such as cardiovascular, diabetes and chronic lung diseases, appear to be at higher risk for severe COVID-19 infection than persons without these conditions 22,24 . Pre-existing cardiovascular disease appears to be particularly important, potentially due to the involvement of the renin angiotensin system signalling pathway 25 .",

The date of hospitalization was available for 140 patients. The median time from symptom onset to hospital admission was four days (IQR= 2 to 6 days, range 0 to 26 days). The most frequent symptoms in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 were fever (122 [83%] of 147) and cough (118 [80\u00b73%] of 147). Multivariable logistic regression showed that chest X-ray abnormalities (AOR: 55\u00b71 [18.88-121.24], p<0\u00b7001) and O 2 saturation <95% (AOR: 14\u00b780 [4\u00b733-55], p<0\u00b7001) were strongly associated with hospitalization (Figure 5A).

Also, one out of six HIV patients that were diagnosed with COVID-19 was hospitalized and underwent mechanical ventilation. None of the reported cases in babies, children, or pregnant women required hospitalization. A large proportion (59 [40\u00b71%] of 147) of hospitalized patients had at least one comorbidity, and the most common were cardiovascular disease/hypertension (47 [29\u00b79%] of 147), diabetes (14 [9\u00b75%] of 147), other respiratory diseases (11 [7\u00b75%] of 147) and solid or haematological neoplasm (7 [4\u00b78%] of 147). Proportions in general population for cardiovascular disease and diabetes are respectively 4\u00b72%, and 6\u00b72% 13 . Multivariable logistic regression analysis showed increasing odds of hospitalization in patients with cardiovascular diseases/hypertension (AOR: 3\u00b741 [1\u00b797-5\u00b787], p<0\u00b7001)",
