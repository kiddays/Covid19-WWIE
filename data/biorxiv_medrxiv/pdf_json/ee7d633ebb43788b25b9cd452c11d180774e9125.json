We analyze seven recent publications on the impact of BCG vaccinations on the development of COVID19 illness and extend presented findings using the latest data from April 10, 2020. We analyze data from 98 countries and we extend existing models by adding the dimension of COVID-19-related testing conducted by the analyzed countries. Similarly to prior studies, we find that COVID-19 attributable case and death incidences across countries share a relationship with a country's BCG vaccination inclusion in the national immunization program when testing is not taken into consideration. However, this relationship vanishes when we add the dimension of testing. We observe that case and death incidences conditional on testing do not get affected by the countries' BCG vaccination inclusion in the national immunization program. Therefore, we show that there is no statistical evidence to support the assertion that inclusion of BCG vaccination in national immunization program (NIP) has any impact of COVID 19 infections (cases) or mortality.",

Within this emerging stream of literature that examines the impact of exogenous factors on COVID-19 spread and outcomes, there has been growing interest in examining the impact of Bacille Calmette Gu\u00e9rin (BCG) vaccine on country level outcomes (Berg et al. 2020; Shet et al 2020; Hegarty et al 2020; Miller et al 2020) . This has been of particular interest to health policy community because there has been some evidence to show that BCG vaccine has non-specific protective effects on infections, as well as long term efficacy against tuberculosis (Fine 1995; Dockrell & Smith 2017) , and therefore, there may also be some positive non-specific immunity related effects for COVID 19 in BCG vaccinated populations. .

To our knowledge the most recent study related to our work has used April 01 data (Berg et al 2020) . Moreover, none of the previous studies have either controlled for COVID-19 test intensity or have looked at the impact of test intensity on observed dependent variable of cases per million or deaths per million. This is critical, because the dependent variable of interest, either cases per million or deaths per million are observed or measured conditional on potentially infected individual which is detected only through testing of symptomatic or even non-symptomatic individual.",

If country A conducts 100,000 tests, then detected number of infections or cases will be 10,000 and number of deaths attributed to infection would be 1,000. On the other hand, if number of tests in country B are only 10,000, then in country B number of cases detected will be 1,000 and number of deaths attributed to infection would be 100. It is easy to see that while both countries have same infection and mortality rates, country A will report 10,000 cases and 1000 deaths per million, while country B will report only 1,000 cases per million and 100 deaths per million. Therefore, considering cases per million or deaths per million as a measure of infection rate and its severity across countries assumes that the disease detection rates across countries are comparable. On the other hand, data from various countries suggests otherwise: tests per million population vary from 13 (Afghanistan) to 100,002 (Iceland) across countries as of April 10, 2020 2 . Furthermore, data suggest that those countries which are reporting higher number of cases as well as deaths per million are also often times reporting higher number of tests per million ( Figure 5 ).",

Our work is different from previous studies along four dimensions: (a) while previous studies have used BCG as a categorical variable, we create a variable, BCG Index, which approximates the proportion of population of a country vaccinated against BCG; (b) we introduce additional controls such as HDI score 3 , number of days since one case per million, population density per km 2 , percentage of population above 65 years of age, percentage of population living in urban areas and government transparency score via Corruption Perception Index (CPI) 4 ; (c) we take into consideration number of tests per million and also use cases per test as dependent variable in the analysis; and (d) use the recent data to verify if the relationships found in earlier studies with prior period data still holds.",

The findings show that countries with BCS vaccinations show lower levels of COVID-19-related mortality. In turn, Berg et al. (2020) , after analyzing data on first 30day COVID-19 country-wise outbreaks, argue that BCG immunizations are associated with flattened growth curves for confirmed cases of COVID-19 infections and deaths. Similarly, Hegarty et al. (2020) argue that countries that vaccinate their populations against BCG, experience less COVID-19-related cases and lower death rates caused by COVID-19. Miller et al.

As the detection of infection is greatly dependent upon the amount of testing being done, we believe there may be endogenous factors affecting the relationship between the inclusion of BCG vaccine in a country's NIP and COVID-19 infection and mortality rates. In the current scenario, testing is the only mechanism through which COVID-19 cases are identified. As such it stands to reason that if a country does not test extensively, it will also report significantly lower number of COVID-19 cases and deaths. Therefore, our dependent 'Cases per test' captures the incidence of disease among those for which measurement has been taken. The robust result of non-significance of BCG inclusion in NIP raises questions on the validity of the assertion that BCG vaccine effects the respective spread of COVID-19 in a population. Hence, we believe the since when testing for COVID measure is included in the analysis, the impact of BCG policy on infection rates vanishes, there is no statistical evidence to support the assertion that BCG vaccination policy lowers infection rate at the country level.",

With each additional year of BCG vaccine inclusion in a country's NIP, we observed a reduction of 13 COVID-19-related cases per million population. Similarly for mortality, each additional year of BCG inclusion resulted in one less death per million. For 'deaths per case' in population, BCG Index was found to be significant, with each additional year of BCG inclusion being responsible for 0.003487 less deaths per case.

We created multiple log linear models where we applied logarithmic transformation on the following variables: 'GDP per capita', 'tests per million' and 'cases per million'. The log-linear regression results are consistent with results reported inTables 3 and 4. Categorical BCG Group 2 and BCG Index were found to be statistically significant factors for 'cases per million', 'deaths per million' and 'deaths per case'. However, both the categorical and continuous BCG inclusion variables were found to be insignificant for the 'cases per test' variable in the log linear models as well.",
