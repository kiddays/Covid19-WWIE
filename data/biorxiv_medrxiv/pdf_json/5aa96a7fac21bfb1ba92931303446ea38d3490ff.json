The disparate ambient temperatures found in the upper and lower respiratory tract have been demonstrated to influence the replication kinetics of common cold viruses as well as the associated host responses. Here, we employed the human airway epithelial cell (hAEC) culture model to investigate the impact of ambient temperatures found in the upper and lower respiratory tract, 33\u00b0C and 37\u00b0C, respectively, on the viral replication kinetics and host innate immune response dynamics during SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV infections. Strikingly, SARS-CoV-2, in contrast to SARS-CoV, replicated more efficiently at temperatures encountered in the upper respiratory tract, and displayed higher sensitivity to type I and type III IFNs than SARS-CoV. Timeresolved transcriptome analysis highlighted a temperature-dependent induction of IFN-mediated antiviral response, whose amplitude inversely correlated with the replication kinetic efficiencies of both SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV at temperatures found in the upper and lower respiratory tract. Altogether, these data reflect clinical features of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV and subsequently, their associated human-to-human transmission efficiencies. They provide crucial insights of the profound impact of ambient temperatures on viral replication and associated pivotal virus -host interaction dynamics. This knowledge can be exploited for the development of novel intervention strategies against SARS-CoV-2.",

The novel coronavirus has a close phylogenetic relationship with SARS-CoV, which emerged in China in 2002/2003 and led to over 8000 confirmed cases worldwide, including 800 deaths 4 . SARS-CoV-2 differs from SARS-CoV by only 380 amino acids over its entire 30 kb genome and retains a high level of conservation in the receptor binding motifs that interact with the human receptor angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) 5 . Despite these similarities, there are currently over 2 million confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 worldwide, including more than 130'000 deaths 6 . Moreover, although the cell surface receptor ACE2 and the serine protease TMPRSS2 have been demonstrated to serve as entry determinants for both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 2,7-9 , an accumulating body of evidence showing dissimilar human-to-human transmission dynamics and clinical courses between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV strongly suggest the presence of different virus-host dynamics during viral infection in the human respiratory epithelium [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] .",

The anatomical distance between the upper and lower respiratory conductive tract, and their different ambient temperatures (32-33\u00b0C and 37\u00b0C, respectively 16, 17 ) have previously been shown to influence the replication kinetics of diverse respiratory viruses, such as rhinoviruses, influenza viruses and coronaviruses [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] . Moreover, the disparity in ambient temperature also affects virus -host immune response dynamics, and thus potential human-to-human transmission dynamics 23 . Interestingly, SARS-CoV-2 has been detected earlier after infection than SARS-CoV in upper respiratory tissues of infected patients 10, 13, 14, 24, 25 , suggesting that transmission kinetics and host innate immune response dynamics might differ between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 infections.",

Our study revealed that SARS-CoV-2 replication improved in hAEC cultures incubated at 33\u00b0C rather than 37\u00b0C and resulted in higher titers than SARS-CoV, while both viruses replicated equally efficiently at 37\u00b0C. Pretreatment of hAEC cultures with exogenous type I and III interferon (IFN) at different temperatures revealed that SARS-CoV-2 is equally sensitive to both type I and III IFN than SARS-CoV, thereby exemplifying the relevance of potent innate immune responses. Importantly, a detailed temporal transcriptome analysis of infected hAEC cultures corroborated initial findings and uncovered characteristic innate immune response gene signatures relating to the viral replication efficiency of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 at different ambient temperatures. Altogether, these results provide the first in-depth fundamental insight on the virus-host innate immune response dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 and the closely phylogeneticallyrelated SARS-CoV, and likely reflect the clinical characteristics and transmission efficiencies of both viruses.",

The polarity of viral progeny release was monitored by collecting apical washes and basolateral medium in 24-hour intervals for a period of 96 hours. Since SARS-CoV-2 can be detected early after infection in the upper respiratory specimens of infected patients 14,24,25 , we incubated virus-infected cultures at both 33\u00b0C and 37\u00b0C to mimic the ambient temperatures of the human upper and lower respiratory tract, respectively. At 37\u00b0C SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 replicated equally efficiently for the first 48 hours, after which SARS-CoV showed, for 2 out of 3 donors, approximately 10fold higher apically released viral progeny titers than SARS-CoV-2 ( Fig. 1a) . Interestingly, when assessing viral replication efficiency at 33\u00b0C rather than at 37\u00b0C, it was apparent that SARS-CoV-2 infection resulted in 100-fold higher titers released in the apical compartment. In contrast, SARS-CoV replication at 33\u00b0C was significantly impaired and delayed until 72 hours post-infection (hpi) (Fig. 1b) .",

Immunofluorescence analysis revealed that ACE2 overlaps with both ciliated and non-ciliated cell populations in uninfected hAEC cultures (Supp. Fig. 3a ). In line with this, analysis of mRNA expression in non-infected hAEC cultures using single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) confirmed that both ACE2 and TMPRSS2 mRNA are found in both secretory and ciliated cell populations (Supp. Fig. 3b-d) 29 . Combined these results demonstrate that despite their shared requirement on ACE2 and TMPRSS2 for entry into host cells, SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 display strong temperaturedependent variation in replication kinetics in hAEC cultures, suggestive of host determinants intervening .

Comparisons of DEGs of the 72-and 96-hour time points from both temperatures identified a core group of nine common ISG-related genes; IFI35, OASL, CMP2K, HELZ2, DDX60, MX1, IFI44L, ISG15 and IFIT3. Following the individual comparisons for SARS-CoV-2, we also performed pairwise comparison between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 to determine which genes were differentially expressed between these viruses. This revealed that irrespectively of temperature the most contrasting difference was observed at 72 hours (Supp. Fig. 4c,   d) .",

To identify significantly enriched biological pathways over time at the different ambient temperatures, we performed pathway enrichment analyses on all unique DEGs detected in the comparison analyses for SARS-CoV-2. This illustrated a distinct temperature-dependent profile for diverse IFN and antiviral signalling pathways (Fig. 3d) . The 43 unique genes associated with these enriched pathways, including RIG-I/DDX58 and OASL, all displayed a clear temporal, temperature-dependent expression pattern that are inversely associated with the previously observed temperature-dependent viral kinetics difference for SARS-CoV-2 (Fig. 3e, Fig. 1a, b, and Supp. Fig. 5 ).

Despite IFNB1, IFNL1, IFNL2 and IFNL3 not being detected as significantly upregulated in our aforementioned DEG analyses (Fig. 3a-e) , their expression levels in SARS-CoV-2 infected hAEC cultures followed a similar temperature-dependent pattern as the ISGs highlighted in Figure 3e (Fig. 3f) . In contrast, and in agreement with previous results (Fig. 3a, e) , SARS-CoV infection only induced a minor elevation of IFNL2 at 37\u00b0C (Fig. 3f) , which correlated with the upregulation of the viral restriction factor IFITM1 at 48 and 72 hours (Fig 3c) .

Given that the viral S protein receptor binding motifs interacting with the human receptor ACE2 are highly conserved between the two viruses and that both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 displayed a similar cell tropism, the 380 amino acid dissimilarities distinguishing SARS-CoV-2 from SARS-CoV account for their differential replication efficiencies 2,7-9 . Another factor that may have influenced our results is the 29-nucleotide truncation in the ORF8 gene of SARS-CoV Frankfurt-1, which was maintained in the SARS-CoV lineage that initiated the international spread of SARS-CoV. Indeed, Muth and colleagues demonstrated that an intact ORF8 invoked 10-fold higher replication kinetics at 37\u00b0C in various cell culture models, including hAEC cultures 32 . Therefore, besides comparing the replication of different SARS-CoV ORF8 variants at the temperature corresponding to the upper respiratory tract, it would be equally compelling to assess the phenotypic influence of similar truncations in the ORF8 gene of SARS-CoV-2, especially since several SARS-CoV-2 isolates bearing a 382-nucleotide deletion truncating the ORF8 gene have been detected 33 . Such SARS-CoV-2 ORF8 variants can be readily engineered using the reverse genetic system recently established in our laboratory 34 .",

The resulting unique molecule identifier (UMI) count matrix of each individual sample was pre-processed, filtered individually and merged in Seurat (v3.1). Data scaling, normalization and regressing out unwanted sources of variation (number of UMI's, mitochondrial content, cell cycle phase) was performed using integrated SCtransform option, followed by dimensional reduction using UMAP (Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection) embedding. For cell type annotation, the resulting integrated dataset was used for unsupervised graph-based clustering to annotate the different cell types using both cluster-specific marker genes and well-known canonical marker genes to match identified clusters with specific cell types found in the respiratory epithelium, as previously described 31 .",

Altogether, these results suggest that the viral replication kinetics of both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 in the upper and lower airways are heavily dependent on innate immune responses elicited by Type I and III IFN, and that a potent IFN response can efficiently restrict viral replication of SARS-CoV-2 in primary well-differentiated hAEC cultures.",

Using an authentic in vitro model for the human respiratory epithelium we demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2, in contrast to SARS-CoV, replicated 100-fold more efficiently at temperatures encountered in the upper respiratory tract, while having similar amounts of Nucleocapsidantigen positive cells. In addition, SARS-CoV-2 displayed a higher sensitivity to type I and type III IFNs than SARS-CoV upon exogenous pretreatment of hAEC cultures, thereby highlighting another crucial hallmark in addition to their disparate viral replication efficiencies. Importantly, temporal transcriptome analysis showed a temperature-dependent induction of the IFN-mediated antiviral and pro-inflammatory responses that inversely correlated with the observed replication kinetic efficiencies of both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 at temperatures found in the upper and lower respiratory tract. One of the most profound phenotypical characteristics of fulminant SARS-CoV-2 is the early replication in the upper respiratory tract of infected individuals, which might facilitate the high transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 14,24,25 . In contrast, SARS-CoV was shown to primarily replicate in the lower respiratory tract and efficient transmissibility occurred at later stages of the clinical course 10,12,13 . The data presented here contribute to the understanding of the disparate human-to-human transmission dynamics for both zoonotic coronaviruses and provide a framework to understand the parameters of the molecular basis of exacerbations induced by SARS-CoV-2 infection in predisposed individuals.",

This work will probably stem additional functional in vivo studies delineating the efficacy of antiviral responses triggered by SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 infections, as well as deciphering the influence of viral antagonists and physical conditions.

Cells were maintained at 37\u00b0C in a humidified incubator with 5% CO2. Primary human tracheobronchial epithelial cells were isolated from patients (>18 years old) undergoing bronchoscopy or pulmonary resection at the Cantonal Hospital in St. Gallen, Switzerland, or Inselspital in Bern, Switzerland, in accordance with ethical approval (EKSG 11/044, EKSG 11/103, KEK-BE 302/2015, and KEK-BE 1571/2019). Isolation and culturing of primary material was performed as previously described 44 . Briefly, cryopreserved cells were thawed and expanded for one week in BEGM medium. After initial expansion phase, cells were transferred into in collagen type IV-coated porous inserts (6.5 mm radius insert, Costar) in 24-well plates. Cells were expanded for another 2-3 days in BEGM in a liquid-liquid state. Once the cells reached 90% confluency, the basolateral medium was exchanged for ALI medium and the apical medium was removed to allow for the establishment of the air-liquid-interface (ALI). Basolateral ALI medium was exchanged three times per week and apical side was washed with Hanks balanced salt solution (HBSS, Gibco) once a week, until the development of a fully differentiated epithelium (3-4 weeks), which was monitored by optical microscopy. Several modifications to the original protocol were used. The concentrations of hydrocortisone for both BEGM and ALI were increased to 0.48 \u03bcg/ml and BEGM was further supplemented with the inhibitors 1 \u03bcmol/L A83-01 (Tocris, Switzerland), 3 \u03bcmol/L isoproterenol (Abcam, Cambridge, United Kingdom) and 5 Switzerland).

Infection of hAEC cultures Well-differentiated hAEC cultures were infected with 30,000 plaque-forming units (PFU) of either SARS-CoV or SARS-CoV-2. Viruses were diluted in Hanks balanced salt solution (HBSS, Gibco), inoculated on the apical side and incubated for 1 h at 33\u00b0C or 37\u00b0C. Afterwards, virus inoculum was removed, and the apical surface washed three times with HBSS, whereby the third wash was collected as the 1 hpi timepoint. The cells were incubated at the indicated temperatures in a humidified incubator with 5% CO2. Released virus progeny were monitored every 24 h by incubating 100 \u00b5l of HBSS on the apical surface 10 min prior to the time point. The apical washes were collected, diluted 1:1 with virus transport medium (VTM), and stored at -80\u00b0C for later analysis. Basolateral medium was collected at each time point and stored at -80\u00b0C for later analysis. Fresh ALI medium was then added to the basolateral compartment. To analyze virus replication following interferon (IFN) exposure, hAEC cultures were pretreated with recombinant universal type I IFN (100 IU/ml; Sigma) or recombinant IFN-\u03bb3 (100 ng/ml; 46 ) for 18 h from the basolateral side, prior to infection and incubated at either 33\u00b0C or 37\u00b0C.
