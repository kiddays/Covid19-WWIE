Greater correlations were found in mobile searches compared to that of 30 desktop searches, indicating the changing behavior in searching health online information. The 31 use of both Google and NAVER RSV to explore the patterns of community health risk 32 perception could be beneficial for targeting risk communication in several perspectives including 33 time, population characteristics, and location. 34",
