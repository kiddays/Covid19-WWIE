All Danish blood donation facilities participated in this survey. From April 6 to April 17, 2020 a total of 9,496 blood donations were given by 17-69-year-old donors. Blood donors are healthy and must comply with strict eligibility criteria 3 . Currently, donors must self-defer for two weeks if they develop fever with upper respiratory symptoms. SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgM antibodies were tested on EDTA plasma or whole blood by a lateral flow test according to the manufacturer's recommendations (IgM/IgG Antibody to SARS-CoV-2 lateral flow test, Livzon Diagnostics Inc., Zhuhai, Guangdong, China). Samples were concluded as reactive if the IgM, the IgG, or both bands were visible. A validation of the lateral flow test was performed. A total of 651 plasma samples from blood donors giving blood before November 2019 were tested (3 reactive of 651 samples, 1 inconclusive). Specificity was estimated to be 99.54% (98.66-99.90). Samples from 155 patients with previous SARS-CoV-2 were tested; 128 were reactive. Sensitivity was thus estimated to be 82.58% (75.68-88.20). Inter-observer agreement was assessed by three independent raters of 299 samples. The observed Kappa (Fleiss) score was 92%",
