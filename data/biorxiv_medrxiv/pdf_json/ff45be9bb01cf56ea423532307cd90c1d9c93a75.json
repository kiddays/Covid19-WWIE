            "text": "We evaluated if interventions aimed at air travellers can delay local SARS-CoV-2 community transmission in a previously unaffected country. Methods: We simulated infected air travellers arriving into countries with no sustained SARS-CoV-2 transmission or other introduction routes from affected regions. We assessed the effectiveness of syndromic screening at departure and/or arrival & traveller sensitisation to the COVID-2019-like symptoms with the aim to trigger rapid self-isolation and reporting on symptom onset to enable contact tracing. We assumed that syndromic screening would reduce the number of infected arrivals and that traveller sensitisation reduces the average number of secondary cases. We use stochastic simulations to account for uncertainty in both arrival and secondary infections rates, and present sensitivity analyses on arrival rates of infected travellers and the effectiveness of traveller sensitisation. We report the median expected delay achievable in each scenario and an inner 50% interval. Results: Under baseline assumptions, introducing exit and entry screening in combination with traveller sensitisation can delay a local SARS-CoV-2 outbreak by 8 days (50% interval: 3-14 days) when the rate of importation is 1 infected traveller per week at time of introduction. The additional benefit of entry screening is small if exit screening is effective: the combination of only exit screening and traveller sensitisation can delay an outbreak by 7 days (50% interval: 2-13 days). In the absence of screening, with less effective sensitisation, or a higher rate of importation, these delays shrink rapidly to less than 4 days. Conclusion: Syndromic screening and traveller sensitisation in combination may have marginally delayed SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks in unaffected countries.",

Sensitising arriving travellers to the symptoms and risk of SARS-CoV-2 and encouraging appropriate reactions (e.g., early self-isolation, requesting medical assistance via telephone, reporting travel history to providers to trigger tracing and quarantine of contacts), may have a more pronounced effect and has been implemented in many transport hubs (7) . Unfortunately, with increasing numbers of infected travellers contact tracing is unlikely to be sustainable for long because of the immensely resource-intensive nature of contact tracing and hence is similarly unlikely to prevent local transmission in the long term (8) .",

We consider that the epidemic grows exponentially at the source during the early phase of the outbreak when the population is effectively entirely susceptible. In addition to their use in modelling the risk of exportation of SARS-CoV-2 (11) and turning points for daily case trends in SARS-CoV (12) , nonhomogeneous Poisson processes, particularly those with decreasing inter-arrival times, have previously been applied to a range of infectious disease settings for investigating the effectiveness of border control (13) , estimating epidemic parameters (14) and assessing scheduling in mass immunisation clinics for pandemic Influenza (15) .",

Additionally, because \u0734 is uncertain, this leads to uncertainty in q and variability in \u202b\u0750\u202c beyond the stochasticity from the arrival process. This exponential growth rate is consistent with a case doubling times of: 5 days (95% interval: 4.3, 6.2 days) found by Ferretti et al. (17) which would give a growth rate of approximately 0.14; and that of 6.4 days (5.8, 7.1 days) by Wu et al. (18) giving a growth rate of 0.11 days. We have chosen to parameterise in terms of the exponential growth rate of the epidemic rather than the doubling time of cases to account for recovery at the travel origin.",

For those assumptions, Quilty et al estimate the mean probability of SARS-CoV-2 infected travellers not being detected at either exit or entry screening as 46% and as 42% for exit-only screening. Here we consider the uncertainty in \u03b8 by bootstrap resampling 100 travellers per simulation from the model of Quilty et al. and obtain 95% confidence intervals of (33%, 53%) and (37%, 57%) respectively.

The combination of syndromic screening and traveller sensitisation may more substantially delay an outbreak while the number of infected travellers is this low (12 days, 50%: [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] .

These results are sensitive to a number of key assumptions: with increasing R 0 , less heterogeneous R 0 or less effective traveller sensitisation the estimated achievable delay quickly becomes negligible. Furthermore, once the weekly number of infected passengers increases to 10 and above, e.g. as a result of an exponential increase in cases at the origin of travel, even the combination of syndromic screening and traveller sensitisation delays is unlikely to delay an outbreak for more than a week.",

We find that syndromic screening on arrival can add to the effect of traveller sensitisation in these early stages of a pandemic. Syndromic screening can also aid to reduce the number of passengers that would eventually self-report and then require resource-intensive follow up, including contact tracing. As the rate of infected arrivals increases, contact tracing becomes increasingly more difficult and the effectiveness is likely to decrease, further shortening the achievable delays. Therefore, syndromic screening may have an additional role in helping to sustain control efforts for longer. Of note, however, is that syndromic screening at arrival only substantially adds to control efforts if syndromic screening at departure is absent or largely ineffective.",

For example, we have assumed recently reported heterogeneity in the individual R 0 , however, the reported range of uncertainty includes SARS-like and influenza-like which can drastically alter the results. Some recent estimates would suggest more SARS-like or even more overdispersed k which would imply that longer outbreak delays are possible as shown in our sensitivity analysis (30) . We also don't explicitly account for potential asymptomatic transmission. However, we implicitly do so as both the syndromic screening as well as the contact tracing work that informed our estimates accounted for a small proportion of asymptomatic transmitters who we assume similarly transmit but will not be affected by syndromic screening or sensitisation. Furthermore, the results are predicated on a syndromic screening sensitivity of 86% (6) . When reducing the sensitivity to 70%, as used in other reports (5) , delays reduce by about 20%.",

The expected delay of a local outbreak as a result of traveller targeted interventions will depend on the pathogen specific epidemiology but potential pre-and asymptomatic transmission are a key challenge to the success of such. Further, for pathogens with long incubation period, syndromic screening is likely to miss many infected passengers and a high reproduction number increases the chance that a single missed infected will trigger a local outbreak.",
