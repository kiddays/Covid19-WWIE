In additon, eosinopenia patients had lower SpO2, high AST levels and less counts of lymphocyte than non-eosinopenia patients. In our unpublished data, eosinopenia is more frequent than lymphopenia in COVID-19, implicating that eosnophils may be a better sensitive indicator than lymphocyte for evaluating the severity of COVID-19. In multivariate analysis, we found that less lymphocyte countswas independent risk factor of eosinopenia in COVID-19 patients. Apart from SARS-CoV-2, infection of MERS-CoV also had low counts of eosnophils enhancing the ability to detect patients with MERS-CoV 24 . Interestingly, effective administration of MERS-CoV vaccine could increase IL-5 and IL-13 cytokines leading to lung eosinophils elevated 25 . Coronavirus vaccines included SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV can develop lung eosinophilic immunopathology 26 . Additionally, eosinopenia is common in patients with H1N1 influenza 27 .
