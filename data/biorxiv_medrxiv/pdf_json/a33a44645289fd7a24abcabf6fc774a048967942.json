            "text": "Identifying transcriptional responses that are most consistently associated with 16 experimental coronavirus (CoV) infection can help illuminate human cellular signaling 17 pathways impacted by CoV infection. Here, we distilled over 3,000,000 data points from 18 publically archived CoV infection transcriptomic datasets into consensus regulatory 19 signatures, or consensomes, that rank genes based on their transcriptional 20 responsiveness to infection of human cells by MERS, SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 21 subtypes. We computed overlap between genes with elevated rankings in the CoV 22 consensomes against those from transcriptomic and ChIP-Seq consensomes for nearly 23 880 cellular signaling pathway nodes. Validating the CoV infection consensomes, we 24 identified robust overlap between their highly ranked genes and high confidence targets 25 of signaling pathway nodes with known roles in CoV infection. We then developed a 26 series of use cases that illustrate the utility of the CoV consensomes for hypothesis 27 generation around mechanistic aspects of the cellular response to CoV infection. We 28 make the CoV infection consensomes and their universe of underlying data points freely 29 accessible through the Signaling Pathways Project web knowledgebase. : bioRxiv preprint Josset et al., 2013; Sims et al., 2013; Yoshikawa et al., 2010). To date however the field 55 has lacked a resource that fully capitalizes on these datasets by, firstly, using them to 56 rank human genes according to their transcriptional response to CoV infection and 57 secondly, contextualizing these transcriptional responses by integrating them with 58 'omics data points relevant to host cellular signaling pathways. Here, as a service to the 59 research community to catalyze the development of novel CoV therapeutics, we 60 generated consensomes for infection of human cells by MERS, SARS1 and SARS2 61 CoVs. We then analyzed the extent to which high confidence transcriptional targets for 62 these viruses intersected with genes with elevated rankings in transcriptomic and ChIP-63 Seq consensomes for cellular signaling pathway nodes. Integration of the CoV 64 consensomes with the existing universes of SPP transcriptomic and ChIP-Seq data 65 points in a series of use cases illuminates previously uncharacterized intersections 66 between CoV infection and human cellular signaling pathways. The CoV infection 67 consensome and its underlying datasets provide researchers with a unique and freely 68 accessible framework within which to generate and pressure test hypotheses around 69 human cellular signaling pathways impacted by CoV infection.",

To do this we searched the Gene Expression Omnibus 78 (GEO) and ArrayExpress databases to identify datasets involving infection of human 79 cells by these species. From this initial collection of datasets, we next carried out a 80 three step quality control check as previously described (Ochsner et al., 2019), yielding 81 a total of 3,041,047 million data points in 111 experiments from 25 independent CoV 82 infection transcriptomic datasets (Supplementary information, Section 1). Using these 83 curated datasets, we next generated consensomes for each CoV species, as well as 84 one ranking genes across all CoV infection experiments (ALL CoV). As a reference 85 consensome for a virus whose transcriptional impact on human cells has been studied 86 in depth, we also generated a consensome for human influenza A virus (IAV) infection. 87 The Supplementary information files contain the full human ALL CoV (Section 2), MERS 88 (Section 3), SARS1 (Section 4), SARS2 (Section 5) and IAV (Section 6) infection 89 transcriptomic consensomes. To assist researchers in inferring transcriptional regulation 90 of signaling networks, the ALL CoV consensome is annotated to indicate the identity of 91 a gene as encoding a bioactive small molecule, receptor, signaling enzyme or 92 transcription factor (Supplementary information, Section 2, columns W-Z). As an initial 93 benchmark for the ALL CoV consensome, we assembled a list of 20 interferon-94 stimulated genes (ISGs), which encode many of the key canonical viral response 95 factors (Supplementary information, Section 2, column I) (Schneider et al., 2014).

These include chemokine and cytokine-activated receptors, signaling 36 enzymes and transcription factors, and the genomic targets encoding their downstream 37 effectors (Takeda et al., 2003; Stark et al., 1998; Darnell et al., 1994)]. We recently 38 described the Signaling Pathways Project (SPP; (Ochsner et al., 2019), an integrated 39 'omics knowledgebase designed to assist bench researchers in leveraging publically 40 archived transcriptomic and ChIP-Seq datasets to generate research hypotheses. A 41 unique aspect of SPP is its collection of consensus regulatory signatures, or 42 consensomes, which rank genes based on the frequency of their significant differential 43 expression across transcriptomic experiments mapped to a specific signaling pathway 44 node or node family. By surveying across multiple independent datasets, we have 45 shown that consensomes recapitulate pathway node-genomic target regulatory 46 relationships to a high confidence level (Ochsner et al., 2019). 47 Placing the transcriptional events associated with human CoV infection in context with 48 those associated with other signaling paradigms has the potential to catalyze the 49 development of novel therapeutic approaches. The CoV research community has been 50 active in generating and archiving transcriptomic datasets documenting the 51 transcriptional response of human cells to infection by the three major CoV species, 52 namely, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS) and severe acute 53 respiratory syndrome coronaviruses 1 (SARS1) and 2 (SARS2) (DeDiego et al., 2011; were assigned appropriately elevated rankings in the consensome. 98 To gain insight into transcriptional intersections between CoV infection and human 99 cellular signaling pathways, we next computed genes with elevated rankings in the CoV 100 consensomes against genes with high confidence regulatory relationships with cellular 101 signaling pathway nodes. To do this we generated five lists of genes corresponding to 102 the ALL CoV, MERS, SARS1, SARS2 and IAV transcriptomic consensome 95 th 103 percentiles. We then retrieved genes in the 95 th percentiles of human transcriptomic (n 104 = 30) consensomes and ChIP-Seq (n = 834) consensomes for a collection of cellular 105 signaling pathway nodes, and computed the extent and significance of their overlap with 106 genes in the 95 th percentiles of each of the five CoV consensomes. Significant overlap 107 between the 95 th percentiles of a node/node family consensome and a CoV 108 consensome would indicate a potential biological relationship between loss or gain of 109 function of that node and the transcriptional response to CoV infection. 110 For clarity and brevity we will refer from here on to the 95 th percentile of a ChIP-Seq 111 consensome as \"CC95\" and the 95 th percentile of a transcriptomic consensome as 112 \"TC95\". Of the 834 node CC95s evaluated, 377 had significant overlap (p < 0.05) with at 113 least one of the CoV infection TC95s; of the 30 node/node family TC95s evaluated, 25 114 had significant overlap (p< 0.05) with at least one of the CoV infection TC95s. Results of 115 these analyses are shown in Figure 2 (receptor and enzyme transcriptomic analysis), ChIP-Seq transcription factor analysis), Figure 4 (ChIP-Seq enzyme analysis) 117 and Figure 5 (ChIP-Seq co-node analysis); see also Supplementary information Section 118 7 for the complete numerical data. We next surveyed the significant overlaps to identify CoV infection, thereby validating the consensome approach in this context; 121 and (ii) evidence for previously uncharacterized transcriptional biology of CoV infection 122 that are consistent with their roles in the response to other viral infections. 123 Receptors Reflecting their well-documented roles in the response to viral infection, we 124 observed appreciable significant overlap between all TC95s and those for the toll-like 125 (TLR (Totura et al., 2015), interferon (IFNR (Hensley et al., 2004)) and tumor necrosis 126 factor (TNFR (W. Wang et al., 2007)) receptor families (Fig. 2). Interestingly, these 127 signatures were particularly highly enriched in the SARS2 TC95 -potentially reflecting a 128 particularly strong antiviral response to infection by SARS2. TC95 overlaps for receptor 129 systems with previously uncharacterized connections to CoV infection, including 130 epidermal growth factor receptors, glucocorticoid receptor and NOTCH receptor 131 signaling, are consistent with the known roles of these receptor systems in the context 132 of other viral infections (Hayward, 2004; Ito et al., 2011; Ng et al., 2013; Ostler et al., 133 2019; Zheng et al., 2014). The relatively strong enrichment for xenobiotic receptors 134 reflects work describing a role for pregnane X receptor in innate immunity (S. Wang et 135 al., 2014) and points to a potential role for members of this family in the response to 136 CoV infection.",

            "text": "2: discrimination between genes frequently differentially expressed in 219 response to CoV, but not IAV, infection220    We next wished to gain insight into signaling paradigms that were selectively 221 characteristic of CoV infection but not IAV infection. To do this we generated a set of 222 genes that were frequently differentially expressed in response to CoV infection (ALL 223 CoV TC99), but less frequently expressed in response to IAV infection (50 th percentile)Table 1). Interestingly, this group contained two genes encoding transcription factors225 with well characterized roles in the regulation of oscillatory gene expression, PER1 and 226 PER2 (Yamajuku et al., 2010). This led us to speculate that genomic targets of 227 transcriptional regulators of circadian rhythms might be enriched among high 228 confidence CoV-regulated genes, but not IAV-regulated genes. Consistent with this we 229 observed significant overlap between the CC95s of the master circadian transcription 230 factors ARNTL1/BMAL1 and CLOCK (Gaucher et al., 2018) and the CoV TC95, but not signaling and the cellular oscillatory apparatus. Another gene of note in 233 this group is INHBA, encoding activin A, overexpression of which in murine lung gives 234 rise to a phenotype resembling acute respiratory distress-like syndrome (Apostolou et 235 al., 2012), a condition commonly associated with CoV infection (Totura & Bavari, 2019). 236 Other genes in the group provide evidence for the potential mechanisms of infection 237 and propagation of CoVs. TJAP1, for example, encodes a member of a family of 238 proteins involved in regulation of tight junctions, shown to be route of porcine epidemic 239 diarrhea coronavirus entry into epithelial cells (Luo et al., 2017). In addition, GON7 is a 240 member of the KEOPS complex (Wan et al., 2017), which is involved in 241 threonylcarbamoylation of tRNAs, which represent an important host facet of the 242 retroviral life cycle (Jin & Musier-Forsyth, 2019). Interestingly, another critical gene in 243 this tRNA pathway, YRDC, is the 19 th ranked gene in the ALL CoV consensome 244 (Supplementary information Section 2). 245 246 Use case 3: evidence for antagonism between progesterone receptor and 247 interferon receptor signaling in the airway epithelium 248 Although a lack of clinical data has so far prevented a definitive evaluation of the 249 connection between pregnancy and susceptibility to SARS2 infection in COVID-19, 250 pregnancy has been previously associated with the incidence of viral infectious 251 diseases, particularly respiratory infections (Sappenfield et al., 2013; Siston et al., 252 2010). We were interested therefore to see consistent overlap between the 253 progesterone receptor (PGR) TC95 and all the viral TC95s, with the enrichment being the crosstalk implied by this overlap in the context of the airway epithelium, we 256 first identified a set of 16 genes that were in both the ALL CoV and PGR TC95s. We 257 then retrieved two SPP experiments involving treatment of A549 airway epithelial cells 258 with the PGR full antagonist RU486 (RU), alone or in combination with the GR agonist 259 dexamethasone (DEX). As shown in Figure 6 , there was nearly unanimous correlation 260 in the direction of regulation of all 16 genes in response to CoV infection and PGR loss 261 of function. These data indicate that antagonism between PGR and IFNR signaling in 262 the airway epithelium may predispose pregnant women to infection by SARS2. 263 264 Use case 4: evidence for a role for the telomerase catalytic subunit TERT in the 265 interferon response to viral infection 266 Although telomerase activation has been well characterized in the context of cell 267 immortalization by human tumor virus infection (Gewin et al., 2004; Klingelhutz et al., 268 1996; Yang et al., 2004), no connection has previously been made between CoV or IAV 269 infection and telomerase. We were therefore intrigued to observe robust overlap 270 between all viral TC95s and that of the telomerase catalytic subunit TERT. In support of 271 this finding, NFkB signaling has been shown to induce expression (Yin et al., 2000) and 272 nuclear translocation (Akiyama et al., 2003) of TERT, and direct co-regulation by 273 telomerase of NFkB-dependent transcription has been linked to chronic inflammation 274 (Ghosh et al., 2012). Inspecting the ALL CoV consensome underlying data points (data 275 not shown) we found that the TERT gene was not transcriptionally induced in response 276 to infection by any of the CoVs, indicating that the overlap between its TC95 and those CoVs might occur in response to an upstream regulatory signal. If functional 278 interactions between TERT and inflammatory nodes did indeed take place in response 279 to CoV infection, we anticipated that this would be reflected in close agreement 280 regarding the direction of differential expression of CoV infection-regulated genes in 281 response to perturbation of TERT on the one hand, and on the other, to stimulation of 282 the classic viral response IFNRs. To test this hypothesis, we took the same set of 20 283 ISGs referred to previously (Fig. 1) and compared their direction of regulation across all 284 experiments underlying the ALL CoV, TERT and IFNR consensomes. For reference, the 285 TERT consensome (Section 13) and its underlying data points (Section 14) are 286 provided in the Supplementary information. With respect to the IFNR and TERT data 287 points, we observed a nearly universal alignment in the direction of regulation of all 288 genes tested with those in the CoV infection experiments (Fig. 6), with agreement in the 289 direction of regulation across 99% of the underlying probesets. We should note that of 290 the 1859 p < 0.05 CoV infection ISG data points, we observed repression, rather than 291 induction, in response to CoV infection in 303 (~15%) , which may be attributable to the 292 impact of differences in cell type, cell cycle stage or virus incubation time across the 293 independent experiments. Our results are consistent with a model in which activation of 294 telomerase is a component of the human innate immune response to viral infection.",

Of the 834 CC95s 307 analyzed, overlap (p < 0.05) was specific to the SARS2 CC95 for only five; SNAI2/Slug, 308 SOX2, GATA6, CTBP1 and PRMT1. Strikingly, a literature search indicated that these 309 five nodes were connected by documented roles in in the promotion of EMT (Avasarala 310 et al., 2015; Herreros-Villanueva et al., 2013; Martinelli et al., 2017; Nieto, 2002; Sahu 311 et al., 2017). In addition to these nodes, whose C95 genes were exclusively enriched (p 312 < 0.05) in the SARS2 C95 genes, we identified several other EMT-linked nodes whose 313 CC95 genes were preferentially enriched (p < 0.05) in the SARS2 TC95 genes (Figs. 3-314 5), including the homeodomain transcription factor SIX2 (C.-A. Wang et al., 2014), 315 SMAD4 (Siraj et al., 2019), and the co-nodes PYGO2 (Chi et al., 2019), SKI (Tecalco-316 Cruz et al., 2018), BRD7 (T.

Interestingly, several members of the group 344 of SARS2-induced EMT genes have been associated with signature pulmonary 345 comorbidities of CoV infection, including ADAR (Diaz-Pina et al., 2018)basigin, has been linked to EMT in the context of organ fibrosis (Kato et al., 349 2011; Ruster & Wolf, 2011; C. Wang et al., 2018). Moreover, overlap between of the 350 CoV TC95s and the TERT CC95 was particularly robust in the case of SARS2, a finding 351 of potential relevance to the fact that telomerase has been implicated in EMT (Z. Liu et 352 al., 2013). Collectively, our data indicate that EMT warrants further investigation as a 353 SARS2-specific pathological mechanism. 354 Development of a CoV infection cell signaling knowledgebase 355 Having validated the ALL CoV consensome, we next wished to make it freely available 356 to the research community for re-use in the characterization of signaling events 357 associated with CoV infection. Firstly, the viral infection datasets were curated 358 accordingly to our previously described protocol (Ochsner et al., 2019) made available 359 for browsing in the SPP Dataset listing (https://www.signalingpathways.org/index.jsf). As 360 with other SPP datasets, and per FAIR data best practice, CoV infection datasets were 361 associated with detailed descriptions, assigned a digital object identifier, and linked to 362 the associated article to place the dataset in its original experimental context. Loading 363 the CoV datasets into the SPP also automatically made the underlying data points 364 discoverable by the SPP query tool Ominer (Ochsner et al., 2019). These reports 365 represent a summary of the current state of transcriptomic and ChIP-Seq knowledge on 366 the regulatory relationship of a given gene with upstream regulatory pathway nodes, or 367 in clinical and model experiments. The full value of the integration of the CoV 368 consensome with the existing SPP framework can perhaps be best appreciated in the the one click links to Ominer Regulation Reports from the individual CoV 370 datasets. These Reports provide researchers with a wealth of contextual data on 371 signaling pathways impacted by CoV infection in the context of a specific gene. Table 2 372 shows links to Regulation Reports for the top twenty ranked genes in the ALL CoV 373 consensome. The order of sections in the Reports is Receptors, Enzymes, Transcription 374 Factors, Co-nodes, Clinical and Models, the last section including data points from the 375 CoV infection model experiments that form the basis of this study.",

It also demands routine access to existing datasets 380 that is unhindered either by paywalls or by lack of the informatics training required to 381 manipulate archived datasets in their unprocessed state. Moreover, the substantial 382 logistical obstacles to BSL3 certification only emphasizes the need for fullest possible 383 access to, and re-usability of, existing CoV infection datasets to focus and refine 384 hypotheses prior to carrying out in vivo CoV infection experiments. To this end, we 385 generated a set of CoV infection consensomes that rank human genes by the 386 reproducibility of their significant differential expression in response to infection of 387 human cells by CoVs. We then computed the CoV consensomes against high 388 confidence transcriptional signatures for a broad range of cellular signaling pathway 389 nodes, affording investigators with a broad range of signaling interests an entrez into 390 the study of CoV infection of human cells. The five use cases described here represent 391 illustrative examples of the types of analyses that users are empowered to carry out in 392 the CoV infection knowledgebase. 393 To democratize access to the CoV consensome and its >3,000,000 underlying data 394 points by the broadest possible audience, we have integrated them into the SPP 395 database to create a cell signaling knowledgebase for CoV infection.

Not unexpectedly -and speaking again to validation of the consensomes -the strongest and most significant CoV TC95 overlaps were observed for CC95s for known transcription factor mediators of the transcriptional response to CoV infection, including members of the NF\u03baB (Ludwig & Planz, 2008; Poppe et al., 2017; Ruckle et al., 2012), IRF (Chiang & Liu, 2018) and STAT (Blaszczyk et al., 2016; Frieman et al., 2007; Garcia-Sastre et al., 1998) transcription factor families. Consistent with its known role in the regulation of interferon-stimulated genes (Hasan et al., 2013), we also observed appreciable overlap between the CC95 for TFEB and the ALL CoV TC95. Moreover, the strong overlap between the GTF2B/TFIIB CC95 and all viral TC95s reflects previous evidence identifying GTF2B as a target for orthomyxovirus 152 (Haas et al., 2018), herpes simplex virus (Gelev et al., 2014) and hepatitis B virus",
