            "text": "22 Ferrets undergo significant variation in body weight seasonally, affected by photoperiod, 23 and these variations make it difficult to use weight as an indicator of health status. To 24 overcome this requires a better understanding of these seasonal weight changes. We 25 provide a normative weight data set for the female ferret accounting for seasonal 26 changes, and also investigate the effect of fluid regulation on weight change. Female 27 ferrets (n=39) underwent behavioural testing from May 2017 to August 2019 and were 28 weighed daily while housed in an animal care facility with controlled light exposure. In the 29 winter (October to March), animals experienced 10 hours of light and 14 hours of dark, 30 while in summer (March to October), this contingency was reversed. Individual animals 31 varied in their body weight from approximately 700 to 1200 g. However, weights fluctuated 32 with light cycle, with animals losing weight in summer, and gaining weight in winter such 33 that they fluctuated between approximately 80% and 120% of their long term average 34 weight. Ferrets were weighed as part of their health assessment while experiencing water 35 regulation for behavioural training. Water regulation superimposed additional weight 36 changes on these seasonal fluctuations, with weight loss during the 5 day water 37 regulation period being greater in summer than winter. These data establish a normative 38 benchmark for seasonal weight variation in female ferrets that can be incorporated into : bioRxiv preprint 42 of biomedical research areas, including: neuroscience [1-6], drug development [7] and 43 respiratory diseases such as Influenza and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) 44 [8,9] including the new coronavirus strain, SARS-CoV-2 [10]. In laboratory animals 45 exposed to scientific procedures, a standard approach to monitoring health status is to 46 measure body weight. Weight loss is a key indicator of health problems, and therefore 47 understanding the factors that contribute to natural variation in body weight is critical for 48 correctly monitoring an animal's condition. Ferrets undergo significant variation in their 49 body weight seasonally; however, there is currently no normative data available to provide 50 a benchmark for the expected seasonal weight changes. Seasonal variations may mask 51 or exaggerate changes in body weight due to an experimental procedure or change in 52 health status and thus must be integrated into assessments of a ferret's health status. 53 Seasonal weight changes have been demonstrated in multiple species 54 independent of diurnality, including monkeys [11,12], raccoons [13], hamsters [14] and 55 rodents [15]. There are a range of potential factors that elicit seasonal weight changes, 56 but temperature and day length are key triggers, which are ultimately crucial for survival. 57 Ferrets are members of the mustelid family and have been domesticated from 58 European polecats, a species which was native to western Euroasia. Seasonal weight 59 changes have been observed in polecats and other closely related species such as mink. 60 These weight changes are seen as adaptations to the differing energy intake and 61 expenditure requirements of winter and summer [16,17]. In animal care facilities, daylight . 4 62 hours can be easily regulated and are often set at a 12-hour light cycle (12-hours ON, 12-63 hours OFF) or synchronised with the external environment; for example, varying from a 64 minimum 8-hour cycle in winter (8-hours ON, 16-hours OFF) to maximum 16-hour cycle 65 in summer (16-hours ON, 8-hours OFF) [18-21]. Variation in the photoperiod can change 66 factors such as eating habits, coat thickness, sleep and activity levels -all of which may 67 contribute to normal and possible abnormal weight changes. Previous research has 68 demonstrated that ferret weights increase as hours of daylight decrease, leading to 69 sinusoidal weight fluctuations with annual light cycle [22,23]. Contrastingly, in another 70 study where the sleep habits of two male ferrets were tracked, light/dark schedule was 71",

In contrast, expected weight loss in the 404 summer was roughly linear, with animals losing roughly 0.7%/week, except in weeks 405 which were preceded by access to free water in which weight loss was around 1.5%.",

Examination of the observed and predicted 273 values revealed that while the models predicted the key trends, they poorly captured the 274 extent of the variability occurring within individual animals over time. In Figure 6, four 275 example animals are shown -the first two animals show what is typical of most of our 276 animals which is that the model captures the trend but not the details, whereas the second 277 two animals show very different patterns of weight loss which, while quite different from 278 most animals is highly consistent within that individual.

In animal A, the fluctuation in weight due to water 288 regulation is underestimated, and in one year weight loss was more rapid than the model predicted, while 289 in B, the animal varies very little while on water regulation and therefore the fluctuations are over 290 estimated. For this animal the model also underestimates the gradient of weight loss through the summer.291 Most animals looked like those in A and B, however a few animals had substantially different patterns 292 which were highly consistent within each animal from year to year.

Superimposed upon these seasonal 351 fluctuations, water regulation also causes highly stereotyped changes in body weight. 352 The observed seasonal changes in weight imposed large fluctuations in body 353 weight with animals typically being roughly 15% heavier in winter, and 15% lighter in 354 summer (i.e. a variation of as much as 30% of their mean weight). This pattern of seasonal 355 weight change demonstrated by our ferrets follows previously observed changes [22]. 356 The range of mean weights that we observed across our population were in keeping with 357 previously reported data [20,29,33]. There are many possible physiological contributing 358 factors to this seasonal weight loss including coat changes [22,26], fat storage, hormone 359 levels such as melatonin [26] and activity levels which in wild animals are critical for 360 survival [34].361Water regulation imposed an additional pattern of weight changes on animals;362 weight was lost over the week in both summer and winter.

We do not have sufficient repeated data from older animals to determine how 392 ageing interacts with seasonal weight changes. Greater weight loss is observed in aged 393 ferrets (>4 years old) during, and in recovery from, illness [37]. With weight loss an 394 indicator of possible disease, accounting for the age of the animal is important for 395 contextual assessment of health status, and so further research is required to quantify 396 weight changes during ageing and precautionary close observation of weight loss in older 397 animals would be justified.",
