The majority of countries have principally relied on the former; we consider the examples of Italy, Canada and the United States. By fitting a disease transmission model to daily case report data, we infer that in each of the three countries, the current level of national shutdown is equivalent to about half the population being under quarantine. We demonstrate that in the absence of other measures, scaling back social distancing in such a way as to prevent a second wave will take prohibitively long. In contrast, South Korea, a country that has managed to control and suppress its outbreak principally through mass testing and contact tracing, and has only instated a partial shutdown. For all four countries, we estimate the level of testing which would be required to allow a complete exit from shutdown and a full lifting of social distancing measures, without a resurgence of COVID-19. We find that a \"brute-force\" approach of untargeted universal testing requires an average testing rate of once every 36 to 48 hours for every individual, depending on the country. If testing is combined with contact tracing, and/or if tests are able to identify latent infection, then an average rate of once every 4 to 5 days is sufficient.",

With 23 few exceptions, countries have taken drastic social distancing 24 measures (e.g. (7-10)) in an effort to suppress the disease, or 25 at least prevent it from overwhelming a country's critical care 26 capacity. However, these measures have had a massive effect 27 on daily lives and economies throughout the world, and are 28 clearly unsustainable. It is thus critical to devise strategies 29 which will allow the phasing out of social distancing measures 30 while preventing a resurgence of outbreaks ((10),(11)). 31 In this work, we fit a disease transmission model to daily on social distancing via universal shelter-in-place measures. 37 We demonstrate that the rate at which these measures can be 38 eased while preventing future outbreaks is prohibitively slow. 39 We compare these scenarios to that of South Korea, a coun-40 try which has successfully controlled COVID-19 principally 41 through highly aggressive testing and contact tracing, while 42 maintaining a comparatively normal operating of society. We 43 show that an analogous strategy provides a feasible path back 44 to normalcy in Italy, Canada, the US, and by extension other 45 countries. 46 The structure of the paper is as follows: In Section 2 we 47 introduce our model main ideas, notation, and assumptions. 48 We follow in Section 3 with the presentation of results for Italy, 49 Canada, the US and South Korea, wherein we infer the net 50 effect to date of social distancing (in the three former) and 51",

The currently-227 inferred level of effective quarantine, 70%, is kept in place 228 until 1 June 2020, by which time daily incidence is predicted 229 to have dropped to a level of several hundred cases per day. 230 From that point forward, we make monthly adjustments to 231 the effective quarantine level in order to maintain R ef f \u2248 1. 232 Results are shown in Figure 7 . This allows reducing the 233 quarantined population to about 60%. However, thereafter the 234 quarantined can only be released extremely slowly if R ef f is to 235 remain at 1. This is because, at a rate of several hundred cases 236 per day, only a very small fraction of the pool of susceptibles 237 is removed each day.

In this work, we have attempted 323 to quantify the level of testing which would be needed to 324 allow a country to make a near-complete return to a normal 325 functioning of its society. Among the countries considered 326 here, we estimate that a strategy of universal testing alone 327 would require an average testing frequency ranging from about 328 once every 48 hours (Italy) to once a day (the U.S.) for every 329 person. If testing is combined with contact-tracing, and/or 330 if testing is able to already detect infections in their latent 331 phase, then a testing rate ranging from once every 5 days 332 (Italy) to once every 3 days (the U.S.) would be sufficient. 333 These estimates assume a test with sensitivity at or near 100% 334 and immediate isolation once a subject tests positive. Though 335 reaching these targets would necessitate an undeniably enor-336 mous logistic effort, the prospect of an indefinitely-prolonged 337 global shutdown is more daunting still. Furthermore, South 338 Korea has demonstrated (and is continuing to do so) that such 339 an exercise is far from impossible. Assuming social distancing 340 at about a third the level of Italy, we infer an effective mean 341 isolation time well below 5 days from 1 April 2020 onward 342 in South Korea. Development and universal distribution of a 343 self-testing solution combined with further advances in mobile 344 device-based contact tracing would bring a testing-based exit 345 strategy from global quarantine even closer. Nevertheless, it 346 is vital not to rush into a relaxing of distancing measures. 347 First, testing capacity and strong sustainable supply chains 348 for delivery of tests and results must be built. Second, as 349 illustrated in Figures 10 to 13 , if a change in control strategy 350 causes R ef f to exceed 1, how quickly a second wave builds 351 depends on the number of cases at that time. South Korea 352 D R A F T has few cases, so (slightly) exceeding R ef f = 1 would result in a gradual climb of cases, whereas doing so in Canada, which 354 in the near term is predicted to have a significantly higher ",

Assuming 372 asymptomatic infection confers immunity, this would mean a 373 smaller remaining pool of susceptibles and thus a lower current 374 effective reproduction number. Estimates of R0 from time 375 series data of cases depend, as always, on the assumed latent 376 and infectious periods. As we have demonstrated, though 377 (Figure 9), if these periods are longer than the isolation time, 378 then it is the latter which principally drives the disease dy-379 namics. Thus, our findings about threshold isolation times 380 are relatively robust against the possibility of quarantine and testing and tracing policy directions will 384 have to have a very strong dependability on the public cooper-385 ation and compliance. In the first policy, prolonged quarantine 386 and slow relaxation has an unsustainable economic, as well as 387 social and psychological, toll. Populations will become anx-388 ious to resume more normal work, school and social schedules, 389 while compliance with strict measures will become harder to 390 enforce. Under the latter policy, the population is needed to 391 be relied on to comply with self-isolation if testing positive for 392 the virus, as well as self-isolation upon being exposed to an 393 infected person. Last but not least, sustainable supply chains, 394 accuracy and reliability of possible tests as well as privacy 395 issues around electronic contact tracing technology all present 396 important, though not insurmountable, hurdles countries have 397 to come to solve.
