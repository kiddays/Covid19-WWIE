In our assay, remdesivir is the only antiviral tested with strong efficacy, neither chloroquine nor hydroxychloroquine have any beneficial effect in this human cell model, and a small number of compounds not currently being pursued clinically for SARS-CoV-2 have efficacy. We observed weak but beneficial class effects of -blockers, mTOR/PI3K inhibitors and Vitamin D analogues and a mild amplification of the viral phenotype with -agonists.",

We also infected African green monkey kidney epithelial cells (Vero) as a control condition ( Supplemental Figure 1c ). To evaluate the specificity of the phenotypic profile to the impact of the virus we compared the effects of active SARS-CoV-2 to inactive ultraviolet-irradiated (UV-IR) and mock preparations of SARS-CoV-2 on cells. Images were processed using a proprietary deep learning neural network to generate high-dimensional featurizations of each image for the identification of distinct phenotypic profiles. Both HRCE and Vero cells demonstrated robust phenotypes compared to both mock and irradiated controls (Z-factors: HRCE active virus vs mock, 0.432; HRCE active virus vs irradiated, 0.438; Vero active virus vs mock, 0.803; Vero active virus vs irradiated, 0.827) ( Figure 1b ) . Notably, the phenomics assay achieved the aforementioned, highly separable assay window in HRCEs without significant changes in cell count at this time point compared to both mock and UV-IR controls. HRCEs were selected for further screening due to their disease relevance and robust disease-specific phenotype 5 .",

These data may be useful as the basis for prioritizing further work given constrained resources and serve to generate hypotheses for other researchers in this rapidly progressing field. In our case, this data will serve as the basis for ongoing efforts to identify a cocktail of additive or synergistic, orally available, rapidly manufacturable, and safe FDA-approved drugs with robust activity for further study in animals or humans as a stop-gap to a vaccine, and more broadly utilizable than remdesivir.
