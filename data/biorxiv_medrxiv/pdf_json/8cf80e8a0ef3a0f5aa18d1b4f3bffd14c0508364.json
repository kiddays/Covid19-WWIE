These cases exist other than the 712 laboratory-confirmed cases on the Diamond Princess cruise ship. 2, 3 On the other hand according to WHO the worldwide cases of COVID-19 reached to 1,051,635 with 56,985 deaths. 2 1 st case of COVID-19 reported in Japan on 15 th January, 2020 and he was returned from Wuhan, China the mainland from where disease started. 4 On February 1, a passenger who disembarked from the Diamond Princess days earlier in Hong Kong tested positive for the COVID-19 coronavirus. 3 The ship was quarantined immediately after it arrived in Japanese waters on February 3 with 3,711 passengers and crew members on board. 5 Over the next month, more than 700 people on board became infected including a nurse and for several weeks, the ship remained the site of the largest outbreak outside of China. 6 The outbreak of this disease has caused the Japanese government to take drastic measures to contain the outbreak, including the quarantine of millions of residents in Hokkaido, the Diamond Princess cruise ship and other affected cities.",

Overall, the history of the patients showed that 90% of the infected patients had a previous hospitalisation history, as shown in Figure 4 . Similarly, 60% of cases with a previous hospitalisation history had contact with COVID-19 positive cases.

While the Clauset-Newman-Moore algorithm analysis showed that most of the reported cases have contact with positive cases within the country and a music concert in Osaka has played a major role for the community spread of COVID 19. Japan has an excellent public health care system. 13 Care is affordable, so most people see a physician when they are beginning to feel ill, rather than when the conditions have worsened. So far, the low number of cases until the end of March can be directly related to the low number of test performed by Japan as they rely more on clinical diagnosis, X-ray and CT scan reports. 14 As our this study showed that mean interval time for onset of symptoms is 5 days and in other reported studies it is 14-21 days for COVID-19 so there are many chances that many asymptomatic cases were missed and lost in community. 15 While mean interval time from onset of symptoms to diagnostics in case of Japan was found 6\u00b122.6 days while in case of Korea it was 4.3\u00b14.1 days. 16 The current sudden rise in COVID 19 cases in Japan now can be link to this fact.",
