The most affected European countries are, so far, Italy and Spain. In both countries (and others), the authorities decreed a lockdown, with local specificities. The objective of this work is to evaluate the impact of the measures undertaken in Spain to deal with the pandemic. Method: We estimated the number of cases and the impact of lockdown on the reproducibility number based on the hospitalization reports. Results: The estimated number of cases shows a sharp increase until the lockdown, followed by a slowing down and then a decrease after full quarantine was implemented. Differences in the basic reproduction ratio are also very significant, dropping from de 5.89 (95% CI: 5.46-7.09) before the lockdown to 0.48 (95% CI: 0.15-1.17) afterwards. Conclusions: Handling a pandemic like Covid-19 is very complex and requires quick decision making. The large differences found in the speed of propagation of the disease show us that being able to implement interventions at the earliest stage is crucial to minimise the impact of a potential infectious threat. Our work also stresses the importance of reliable up to date epidemiological data in order to accurately assess the impact of Public Health policies on viral outbreak.",

Los pa\u00edses europeos m\u00e1s afectados son, hasta ahora, Italia y Espa\u00f1a. En ambos pa\u00edses (y en otros), las autoridades decretaron un confinamiento, con especificidades locales. El objetivo de este trabajo es evaluar el impacto de las medidas adoptadas en Espa\u00f1a para hacer frente a la pandemia. M\u00e9todo: Estimamos el n\u00famero de casos y el impacto del confinamiento en el n\u00famero b\u00e1sico de reproducci\u00f3n seg\u00fan los informes de hospitalizaci\u00f3n. Resultados: El n\u00famero estimado de casos muestra un fuerte aumento hasta el bloqueo, seguido de una desaceleraci\u00f3n y luego una disminuci\u00f3n despu\u00e9s de la implementaci\u00f3n del confinamiento total.

Since then, the disease has spread all over the world, being declared pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO) on 2020 March 11th. The rapid propagation of the virus around the world has stressed the health systems of many countries to their limit. In Europe, the most affected countries in terms of number of detected cases, hospitalizations and deaths are, to the date, Italy and Spain. This unprecedented situation for the public health systems of these countries forced decision makers to act very quickly in order to minimize the impact of the disease and to avoid collapse. In Spain, the emergency state (estado de alarma) was declared on 2020 March 14th and was hardened with mandatory home confinement except for vital sectors workers (including health professionals, food supply, etc.) on March 30th.",

One of the main challenges in evaluating the impact of these actions is that data are only partially available, as many of the cases are asymptomatic or with mild symptoms (Huang et al. 2020) , and shortage of testing kits prevent testing all patients with possible Covid-19 symptoms. Therefore, the number of cases might be severely underestimated. This issue is common in epidemiology and several methods have been recently proposed to address it (see (Fern\u00e1ndez-Fontelo et al. 2016 , 2019 ) under specific circumstances. Another issue is that, when no massive viral testing of the population is performed, new cases are only detected once symptoms appear, at a variable delay after contamination. This complicates the assessment of the impact of interventions to reduce/slow down the spread of a virus.",

It is believed that hospitalizations in the most reliable of these indicators, 1 as many cases go undetected (some patients are asymptomatic or suffer mild symptoms; saturation of health systems have led to testing only more severely affected patients in some CCAA), and some deaths are not integrated in the official count because of the lack of viral charge testing. There is indeed a large variability between the fraction of hospitalizations per reported case between CCAA: it is 31% in Galicia but 82% in Comunidad de Madrid. This difference is more likely to be due to differences in detecting and reporting cases rather than in the true proportion of infected people requiring hospitalization. It is also more difficult to assess reliably the number of cases from death reports as the latency from infection to death is long and can be very variable across individuals. 1 https://elpais.com/sociedad/2020-04-03/una-epidemia-en-la-que-todas-lascifras-son-una-incognita.html All rights reserved.

In that scenario, Spain would have been approaching herd immunity by mid-April.",

This could be due to a series of factors. First, the communities with largest proportion of cases could start developing herd immunity, hence limiting the propagation of the infection (which seems unlikely given that in the most affected CCAA, only a few percent have been infected according to our estimations). It could also be the result of local policies taken before the national lockdown in the most affected CCAA, or a better compliance of lockdown and social distancing in most affected areas. Another factor could be the migration from the most affected (especially Madrid) to less affected region before lockdown was implemented, 3 or some distortions in the reporting (underreporting) of cases in saturated health systems. 3 see https://elpais.com/espana/madrid/2020-04-08/los-madrilenos-que-huyerona-la-espana-rural-durante-el-confinamiento.html All rights reserved.

Our study has several important limitations. First, as noted previously, it is not clear how reliable is the data the modeling is based on: both epidemiological reports, and infectious estimate probability and latency of symptoms, case detection, hospitalization and death). It should be stressed that the unreliability of epidemiologic data (with changes of criterion of inclusion along time and between CCAA) induces important biases which impedes an accurate estimation of the impact of political measures on the propagation of the new coronavirus. A faster and more reliable tracking of the epidemics could be performed if cases were reported in a systematic way dated by the onset of symptoms rather than detection, as the incubation period has been well characterized. Second, the model captures the number of new cases each day as a proportion from the pool of infected people in the same area. It does not take into account how the age distribution in each area affects that each infection leads to hospitalizations or death, nor how the probability of infecting depends on the days from infection as in (Flaxman et al. 2020 ). Nor do it take into account mobility between regions, whose impact is believed to be more important at the initiation of the epidemics. It is also worth noting that in locked down environment where most contacts are compartmentalized in households, it is possible that at beginning the virus continues to spread rapidly within households, but less so between households. As immunity was not taken care here, 0 may decrease significantly more without further policies, after this first wave of within-household contamination is over.",

Here we use a latent-state approach: we estimated the evolution of the number of true cases in each CCAA based on the recorded accumulated number of detected cases, hospitalizations and deaths provided by Instituto de Salud Carlos III (https://portalcne.isciii.es/covid19/). We used estimates for the proportion of cases that are detected by the Spanish Health system, the proportion of cases that are hospitalized, and the lethality rate , as the well as the distribution of latency between infection and this three types of events ( ) (figure 1). We used the following estimates:15% of contaminated persons are hospitalized; 1% die from disease (Lauer et al. 2020; Zhou et al. 2020); 30% of cases get detected (this latter number was defined arbitrarily, since the number of detected cases is roughly twice the number of hospitalizations). Note that these percentages affect the estimated number of true cases by a scaling factor, but do not affect the estimation of reproduction parameters. We used estimates of the distribution of duration of infection-to-detection, infection-to-hospitalization based on published literature (Lauer et al. 2020; Zhou et al. 2020). Lauer and colleagues describe that the incubation period can be captured by log-normal distribution with median 5.1 days. To capture the extra time from the apparition of symptoms to case detection/hospitalization, we increased the parameter (to yield an increase in median time of 50% for case detection and 100% for hospitalization, that is = 2.03 and = 2.314, respectively) while keeping the same dispersion parameter . For infection-to-death, we used the same distribution as in (Flaxman et al. 2020), i.e. the sum of two gamma distributions for infection-to-detection and detection-to-death with overall mean 23.9 days. Thus the expected numbers of events ( , ) in a certain CCAA is given by convolving the pattern of new cases with the distribution of infection-to-event.",

However new events are sometimes reported later than on the day of occurrence (especially during weekends). We estimated that 30% of events were reported on the following day, 10 % two days later. Assigning such proportion of events to one or two days before they are reported allowed to smooth the event time series. Finally, for the case of 2 CCAA (Madrid and Castilla y La Mancha, until April 12 th for the latter), the reported number of hospitalizations was not cumulative but corresponded to the current number of hospitalized patients related to Covid-19. For Castilla y La Mancha, we found that we could recover the reported cumulative number of hospitalizations on April 12 th by assuming that the duration of hospitalization is distributed uniformly between 5 and 15 days. We used this rule to estimate the cumulative number of hospitalizations for this CCAA, and applied it similarly for Madrid.",
