There are many states like Maharashtra, Delhi, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Gujrat, Uttar Pradesh, and West Bengal, who are still at high risk. These states may see a huge jump in confirmed COVID-19 cases in the coming days if preventive measures are not implemented properly. On the positive side, Kerala has shown how to effectively \"flatten\" or even \"crush the curve\" of COVID-19 cases. We hope India can be free of COVID-19 with a strong determination as already shown by the central and respective state Governments.",

They also discussed hypothetical interventions with various intensities and provided projections over a time horizon. Both the articles have used SIR (susceptible-infected-removed) model for their analysis and prediction. As we discussed earlier, considering the great diversity in every aspect of India, along with its vast population, it would a much better idea to look at each of the states individually. The study of each of the states individually would help decide further actions to contain the spread of the disease, which can be crucial for the specific states only.",

A state where infection-rates are declining for the last few days indicates that the situation is improving. However, a certain jump in infection rates could inform us that there could be cases of COVID-19 that are under-reported. We need to search for infected-clusters as quickly as possible. Second, using the SIS model, we have considered four predicted line-graphs of active infected patients with different infection-rates. The four different infection-rates, used in the SIS model for prediction are the 25 th , 50 th , 75 th, and 80 th percentiles of the observed infection-rates. We also plot the observed active infected patients over time. A declining line-graph of observed active infected patients (red-line) can ensure that measures like lockdown and social distancing are working when all the infected cases are reported/tested. The different predicted lines, using the SIS model, may serve as reference frames to indicate whether the Government needs to enforce the social distancing more stringently. For example,",

Currently the lockdown has been extended till 3 May 2020 with some relaxation [ 24 ]. The SIS model is critically dependent on the infection-rate parameter (\u03b2). It is defined as the number of people infected per unit time from an infected person. Note that this parameter is subject to change due to the effect of lockdown and other preventive measures to ensure social distancing. When people are at home, the infection-rate is expected to be on the lower side. the Effect of Lockdown using daily infection-rate and SIS ModelKumar et al. [ 25 ]  reported the estimated number of people that a person may come in contact with within a day (24 hours) in a rural community in Haryana, India, to be 17. They defined contact as having a face-toface conversation within 3 feet, which may or may not have included physical contact. The estimate of the contact-rate parameter from their paper is 0.70. In practice, only some of all the people who come in contact with a COVID-19 infected person may be actually infected by the virus. Note that India has already taken many preventive measures to ensure social distancing. In the current scenario, the infection-rate based on the above study could be an overestimate of its present value. However, despite nationwide lockdown, banks, hospitals, groceries are still open to cater to the essential needs of people. We consider here two approaches to study the effect of lockdown and other preventive measures jointly in each state. First, we plot the daily infection-rates for each state. The daily infection-rate (DIR) for a given day is defined as",
