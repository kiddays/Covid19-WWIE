            "text": "medRxiv preprint Key Points Question: Do race and ethnic disparities exist in susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection and how can these disparities be explained? Findings: African American race and Hispanic ethnicity are associated with higher likelihood of SARS-CoV-2 infection even after adjusting for other important socio-demographic and comorbidity factors. Residence in a high-density population area partially mediated higher susceptibility among African Americans. Meaning: Minority race and ethnicity increases susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection in a large U.S. Metropolitan area. Though several factors may increase chances of infection among minorities; residence in population dense areas and therefore inability to adequately practice social distancing may explain higher infectivity. Abstract Importance: Despite emerging reports of poor COVID-19 outcomes among African Americans, data on race and ethnic susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection are limited. Objective: To determine socio-demographic factors associated with higher likelihood of SARS-CoV-2 infection. To explore mediating pathways for race disparities in the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Design: Cross sectional analysis of COVID-19 Surveillance and Outcomes Registry (CURATOR). Multivariable logistic regression models were fitted to provide likelihood estimates (adjusted Odds Ratios: aOR, 95% confidence intervals: CI) of positive SARS-CoV-2 test. Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) framework was utilized to explore three mediation pathways (low income, high population density, high comorbidity burden) for association between African American race and SARS-CoV-2 infection. Setting: A large healthcare system comprising of one central tertiary care, seven large community hospitals and an expansive ambulatory and emergency care network in the Greater Houston area.",

We hypothesized that older age, non-white race and ethnic minority status will be associated with significantly higher likelihood of SARS-CoV-2 infection, and factors such as low socio-economic status, residence in high population density areas (proxy for potential difficulties in social distancing) and higher comorbidity burden will mediate the effect of race on SARS-CoV-2 infection.",

CoV-2 data, such race and ethnic disparities have previously been described for the U.S. H1N1 influenza pandemic. 15 These data indicated that Spanish-speaking Hispanics were at a greater risk of H1N1 infection primarily attributable to lack of healthcare access. Black people were also more susceptible to complications of H1N1 infection. 15 We explored three possible mechanisms of race disparities in our data. These included lower socio-economic status, residence in higher population dense areas, and higher level of comorbidities. We demonstrate that African American race is significantly associated with all three potential disparity pathways, and in the traditional multivariable analyses, race and ethnic disparities persisted even after controlling for these pathways. However, our mediation analyses highlighted the potential influence of residence in high population density areas as a viable pathway that at least partially explains race disparity. Pathways mediating the influence of median income and comorbidity status did not demonstrate a significant effect. We utilized population density as a marker for potential inability to maintain adequate social distancing as it has been indicated that maintaining the WHO recommended safe distance between people becomes challenging with high population densities. 16 Furthermore, overall effects of population density and disease spread has been previously described in literature. 17, 18 In addition to lack of social distancing, higher population density may also be associated with several other behavioral and socio-demographic attributes that may predispose to both viral spread and increased susceptibility. For example, there are reports linking obesity, lack of physical activity, and higher mortality with residence in densely populated neighborhoods. 19, 20 As reported, our data also corroborate that older populations may be more susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection; 8 however, younger populations still have cause for concern, as nearly 1 in 4 of the infected cases in our sample were between 36-50 years. Finally, our data demonstrate that males may be approximately 30% more likely to test positive for the SARS-CoV-2 infection. Potential sex differences in infectivity to SARS-CoV-2 and intersectionality with racial and ethnic socioeconomic factors need to be explored further in future analyses. Additional policy-oriented research should prioritize study on the intersectionality of these vulnerable economic statuses and racial disparities in COVID infection indicated by the present study.",

It is highly likely that higher comorbidity burden and detrimental effects of adverse social determinants, including those that may not adequately permit safe practices of social distancing, mediate higher SARS-CoV-2 infectivity among racial and ethnic minorities.",
