In the present study, the dynamic changes of the epidemiologic parameters were taken into account at three different geographical locations: India, China, and countries outside China. The prevailing epidemic scenario in India was compared with the situation worldwide in countries outside China, and China only as depicted in Figure 1 , Figure 2 and Figure 3 respectively, in each figure (a) to (d) representing variation in daily growth rate (DGR) with infected case numbers, observed case numbers with predicted numbers, case recovery rate (CRR) with case fatality rate (CFR), and SI with R, respectively. Since the first detection of COVID- 19 An undulating pattern of DGR of COVID-19 infected cases was observed for India as well as world excluding China, but with gradual decrease in the latter for the last few days, while in China the DGR was <0.3 % since February 23, 2020 onwards, as found in the present study. Sanche et al. [12] estimated the growth rate of the early outbreak of COVID-19, in China, as 0.21-0.30 per day. The CFR, which was defined as the ratio of deaths from COVID-19 to the number of cases, provides an assessment of virulence/clinical severity. Therefore, in order to explore the early insights into the severity of ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, CFR of the disease was also estimated. Yang et al. [13] , using data-driven statistical method, estimated CFR in the early phase of COVID-19 as 0.15% in mainland China without Hubei, 1.41% in Hubei province without Wuhan city, and 5.25% in Wuhan. The COVID-19 CFR in China has been reported to be as high as 15%, due to low initial case number, which on later time decreased to 3\u00b74% [14] . As of March 17, 2020, in Italy, the CFR of COVID-19 has been recorded as 7.2%, which stands higher than the CFR (2.3%) in China, as of February 11, 2020 [15] ; interesting to note, Italy had CFR of 2.3% (as of February 28, 2020), which was identical to the CFR of China [16] . Therefore, though the transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 is high, the CFR of COVID-19 seems to be lesser compared to that of the other human coronaviruses: SARS (9\u00b75%) and MERS (34\u00b74%), but higher than that of influenza (0\u00b71%) [14] . The CFR in India and the world excluding China showed a rising trend CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International license It is made available under a is the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.

Like other countries all over the world, India is experiencing the COVID-19 pandemic since January 30, 2020, and due to its gradual escalation, different states enforced various unprecedented non-pharmaceutical measures, including school and office work closures, alongside testing, contact tracing and quarantine/case isolation, in order to contain the spread of the virus, SARS-CoV-2. Thereafter when the pandemic caused 536 people sick and 10 deaths, India introduced more stringent measures, the countrywide 21-day lockdown enforcement with effect from March 25, 2020, and thereafter, from April 15, 2020, considering the steeping nature of viral transmission in order to stem the disease, COVID-2. The huge physical distancing measure, in the form of country's complete lockdown, in India, had an astonishing effect in slowing down COVID-19 transmission, and this could be explained with the fact of basic reproduction number (R0), the time varying R, and the size of infected population with or without lockdown. The calculated R0 =1.03 herein, indicates the capacity SARS-CoV-2 to transmit effectively from one infected patient to more than one susceptible person and to cause epidemic, and thereafter up to March 24, 2020, the average Re value increased to 1.62, and thus, the transmissibility was increased (Figure 4). However, after lockdown the decrease in estimated Re to 1.37 (from March 25, 2020 to April 10, 2020) is an indication of decreased transmissibility, and Re=0.46 from April 11, 2020 (the day with 0.44% decrease in predicted infected cases of 8483 to observed infected cases of 8446, in absence and presence of lockdown, respectively, and with susceptible proportion of 0.43) to April 17, 2020 (the day with 36% decrease in predicted infected cases of 22,329 to observed infected cases of 14,352, without and with lockdown, respectively, and with susceptible proportion of 0.034), demonstrating a tremendous effect of lockdown in COVID-19 containment (Figure 4). Beyond April 17, 2020, our estimate of 24,431 COVID-19 infected cases with lockdown is 78% lower compared to the 112,042 case estimates in absence of lockdown, on April 27, 2020 (Figure 4).",
