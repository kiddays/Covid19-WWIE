However, the epidemics of two beta coronaviruses namely MERS (Middle East Respiratory Syndrome), SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) has caused over 10,000 deaths over the past two decades. [1, 2] In December 2019, scientists had found series of cases with symptoms resemble to pneumonia in Wuhan, China and identified that it was caused by a novel strain of coronavirus called SARS-CoV-2. Later, on 11 th February 2020, World Health Organization (WHO) has announced COVID-19 (Coronavirus Disease 2019) as new name of the disease. [3] The WHO has announced COIVD-19 as pandemic on 11 th March 2020. [4] As of 19 th April 2020, 185 countries/regions were affected with SARS-Cov-2 with a total of 2,329,651 confirmed cases and 160,721 deaths. [5] Of these countries, highest number of cases are seen in United States (735,086 cases), followed by Spain (194,416 cases), Italy (175,925), France (152,978), Germany (143,724) and United Kingdom (115, 314) . COVID-19 cases in India increasing gradually, and the number of cases as of 19 th April 2020 are 16,365 including 521 deaths. [6] Despite general awareness programs conducted by the state and central governments, there are many false beliefs among the general public of India due to circulation of various misconceptions in social media and internet about the spread of novel coronavirus, and prevention & treatment of COVID-19. False beliefs not only misrepresent the situation but may increase the effects of disasters by compromising the public's collective effort. [7] An advocacy group of BBC said around 46% of adults have been seeing fake news or misleading information about the COVID-19 pandemic and suggested that there is a need to stop the false posts. [8] In Iran, thinking that alcohol can kill the coronavirus, around 600 people died and 3000 were hospitalised after drinking methanol, [9] which is a type of alcohol used in marine, automotive and electricity industries as a renewable energy resource.

Despite many educational programmes initiated by the government and private organizations on prevention of COVID-19, it is noteworthy that the considerable fraction of participants were unaware of all risk factors and modes of transmission of new coronavirus. This fraction of participants could be potential vectors for spread of infection especially in a pandemic like COVID-19. Educating people on survival time of new coronavirus on various objects would help people to understand the need of disinfecting the objects. Creating awareness among people on individuals who are at risk of acquiring COVID-19 will help people to keep themselves in self-quarantine and simultaneously helps in further spread of infection. Participants were aware of major symptoms and steps to be taken if they were in contact with COVID-19 patient. From this All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission.",

Therefore, it is suggested that the governments or nongovernment organizations should have a special focus on educating these categories of population. Furthermore, it is not only the duty of government on educating the people, it is the duty of every citizen of India to educate themselves and others on facts of COVID-19 by relying on trusted sources. Conclusion This study was assessed the knowledge and beliefs of general public of India on COVID-19, and also the factors which are influencing the beliefs of participants. As per the observations in this study, the effort of government agencies of providing accurate information on preventive strategies of COVID 19 has shown a greater impact on the knowledge components about COVID-19. However, still there is need for combined efforts of governments and nongovernment organizations to educate the people to avoid the false beliefs especially among the people who are elderly, having low level of education and non-professional workers on various aspects of COVID-19.",

Almost all participants (96.96%) knew that the new coronavirus will affect lungs. All participants were aware of symptoms of COVID-19. Majority of participants were aware of modes of transmission of COVID-19 and precautions to be taken if affected with COVID-19. Social media (WhatsApp, Facebook etc), News channels, Government websites, Friends, Family, Neighbours, Healthcare Professionals (Doctors, Pharmacists, Nurses etc.) are the major information sources of these participants. The details of participants responses on knowledge about COVID-19 are presented in table 2.Majority of participants agreed to the fact that changes in weather (56.49%), hand dryers (70.34%) and taking hot water bath (59.3%) can't kill the new coronavirus. However, only 42.85% of participants knew the fact that garlic will not help in treating or preventing COVID-19. Majority of participants were aware that the new coronavirus will not spread through mosquito bites (87.22%) and eating non-vegetarian food (88.74%).

However, the credibility of information being received from social media is still debatable.Regarding beliefs of participants on COVID-19, mixed type of responses were observed in this section. Although majority of participants were aware of myths and facts on COVID-19, noticeable number of participants were believing some of these myths. More than 50% of participants were unaware or not sure if UV disinfection lamps, swallowing or gargling warm water and eating garlic helps in prevention or treating COVID-19. According to WHO UV lamps, swallowing or gargling warm or saltwater and consuming garlic will not kill the new coronavirus.[15]  Furthermore, WHO stated that use of UV lamps for sterilizing hands may cause skin irritation.Pandemics does not follow the usual pattern as we see in normal infections. There are no studies conducted stating that changes in temperature or taking hot water bath will kill the new coronavirus. However, based on the study conducted on one of the strains of coronavirus i.e SARS, the maximum survival temperature is 56 o C, which is higher than the normal body temperature (36.5 to 37 o C).[19] The new coronavirus affects the respiratory system of the healthy individual who inhale the virus contained droplets or contacted the contaminated surfaces. According to WHO there is no information or studies till date stating that the new coronavirus can be transmitted through mosquitos.[15]  Alcohol and bleach are strong and effective disinfectants. Alcohol is a highly flammable compound, it is been used to disinfect small surfaces in ventilated places. However, there is no evidence stating that drinking alcohol will kill the new coronavirus. Furthermore, excessive consumption of alcohol may result in serious health complications.",
