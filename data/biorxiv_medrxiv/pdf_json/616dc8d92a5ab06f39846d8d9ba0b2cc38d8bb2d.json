            "text": "Motivation: Infectious diseases from novel viruses are becoming a major public health concern. Fast identification of virus-host interactions can reveal mechanistic insights of infectious diseases and shed light on potential treatments and drug discoveries. Current computational prediction methods for novel viruses are based only on protein sequences. Yet, it is not clear to what extent other important features, such as the symptoms caused by the viruses, could contribute to a predictor. Disease phenotypes (i.e., symptoms) are readily accessible from clinical diagnosis and we hypothesize that they may act as a potential proxy and an additional source of information for the underlying molecular interactions between the pathogens and hosts. Results: We developed DeepViral, a deep learning method that predicts potential protein-protein interactions between human and viruses. First, human proteins and viruses were embedded in a shared space using their associated phenotypes, functions, taxonomic classification, as well as formalized background knowledge from biomedical ontologies. By extending a sequence learning model with phenotype features, our model can not only significantly improve over previous sequence-based approaches for inter-species interaction prediction, but also identify pathways of viral targets under a realistic experimental setup for novel viruses.

            "text": "Infectious diseases emerging unexpectedly from novel pathogens have been a major public health concern around the globe (Jones et al., 2008) . Pathogens disrupt host cell functions (Finlay and Cossart, 1997) and target immune pathways (Dyer et al., 2010) through complex interspecies interactions of proteins (Dyer et al., 2008) , RNA (Fajardo et al., 2015) and DNA (Weitzman et al., 2004) . The study of pathogen-host interactions (PHI) can therefore provide insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying infectious diseases and guide the discoveries of novel therapeutics or provide a basis for repurposing of available drugs. For example, a previous study of many PHIs showed that pathogens typically interact with the protein hubs (those with many interaction partners) and bottlenecks (those of central location to important pathways) in human protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks (Dyer et al., 2008) . However, due to cost and time constraints, experimentally validated pairs of interacting pathogen-host proteins are limited in number. Moreover, there exists a time delay for a validated PHI to be included in a database of PHIs, often requiring manual curation of the literature or text mining efforts (Thieu et al., 2012) . Therefore, the computational prediction of PHIs is a useful complementary approach in suggesting candidate interaction partners out of all the human proteins. Liu-Wei et al.",

While protein functions have been shown to predict intra-species (e.g., human) PPIs (Guzzi et al., 2011; Jain and Bader, 2010; Pesquita et al., 2009) and such protein specific features exist for some extensively studied pathogens, such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Huo et al., 2015) and HIV (Mukhopadhyay et al., 2014) , for most of the novel pathogens, these features are rare and expensive to obtain. As new virus species are being discovered each year, with potentially many more to come (Woolhouse et al., 2012) , a method is needed to rapidly identify candidate interactions from information that can be obtained quickly -such as the signs and symptoms of the host, which may be utilized as a proxy for the underlying molecular interactions between host and pathogen proteins.",

Another method based on protein sequences (Zhou et al., 2018) samples negatives from only the set of host proteins that are less than 80% similar (in terms of sequence similarity) from the host proteins in the positive training data. By construction, these sampling schemes make the human proteins in the negative set different from the positive set; when used not only for training a model but also for evaluating the model's performance, this sampling scheme has the potential to overestimate the actual performance for finding novel PHIs.

DL2Vec first converts the ontologies and entity associations into a graph, with the classes and entities as the nodes and the associations and ontology axioms as the edges. Then several random walks are performed, starting from the entities over to the ontology graph and thereby generating a corpus of walks in the form of sentences capturing the graph neighborhoods and thereby the ontology axioms. Following the construction of such sentences, a Word2vec skipgram model (Mikolov et al., 2013) is used to learn an embedding for each entity by learning from the corpus. The resulting embedding is a vector representation of an entity capturing its co-occurrence relations with other entities within the graph generated by DL2Vec. For an example, the embedding of a virus contains the feature information from its neighborhood on the graph, i.e., its phenotypes and its taxonomic relatives.",

DeepViral is, to the best of our knowledge, the first predictor using clinical phenotypes as an additional feature in PHI prediction and it turned out to provide a significant improvement over purely sequence based methods. Phenotype-based approaches have been successful in predicting disease-gene associations for Mendelian diseases (Hoehndorf et al., 2011) and intra-species PPIs (Alshahrani et al., 2017) , but have not yet been used for the prediction of (inter-species) PHIs in infectious diseases. Our model avoids the bottleneck of identifying the molecular functions of pathogen proteins, by instead introducing a novel and -in the context of infectious diseases -rarely explored type of feature, the phenotypes elicited by pathogens in their hosts, as a \"proxy\" for the molecular mechanisms, which in turn eventually produce the observed clinical phenotypes. By challenging DeepViral with novel viruses, we could extract specific pathways being attacked by the viruses, as indicated by the predicted interactions in the human proteome. The focus of our method on utilizing features generated based on endo-phenotypes observed in humans and mice (Schofield et al., 2016) has therefore the crucial advantage that we can identify host-pathogen interactions that may contribute to particular signs and symptoms. For example, our model consistently prioritizes the interaction between the proteins of Zika virus (NCBITaxon:64320) and DDX3X (UniProt:O00571) in humans. Infections with Zika virus have the potential to result in abnormal embryogenesis and, specifically, microcephaly (Wang et al., 2017) .

DDX3X mutations in humans have been found to result in intellectual disability, specifically in females and affecting individuals in dose-dependent manner (Blok et al., 2015) . While DDX3X has previously been linked to the infectivity of Zika virus (Do\u00f1ate-Maci\u00e1n et al., 2018), our model further suggests a role of DDX3X in the development of the embryogenesis phenotypes resulting from Zika virus infections. While improving over a previous model on Ebola and H1N1 (Zhou et al., 2018) , we argue that the performance of DeepViral on these datasets may have been over-estimated due to the negative sampling scheme based on sequence similarity that is used not only for training but also for evaluation of the model. Under a more realistic evaluation procedure that considers all host proteins as potential interaction partners for novel viruses, the achieved predictive performances are considerably lower. This calls for future efforts in the direction of PHI prediction of novel viruses, an issue today of increasing relevance to global public health. Accurate predictions of potential PHIs for novel pathogens with rapidly obtainable features would be an important aid for the understanding of infectious disease mechanisms and the repurposing of existing drugs.",

            "text": "An example of such a novel virus is the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, which as of 21st April 2020 reached more than 2.5 million infected cases and 170 thousand fatalities globally (Dong et al., 2020) in a timespan of 5 months. Based on a recently released dataset of 332 PHIs from 26 viral proteins of SARS-CoV-2 (Gordon et al., 2020), we applied DeepViral by treating it as a novel family (with no other Coronaviridae viruses in the dataset) and achieved a ROCAUC of 0.738 (0.730-0.747), which is within the observed variability in predicting for different virus families, as shown in Figure 4 . This family-wise variability suggests that the learned features to predict for PHIs may have different generalization power across families, possibly a result of varying degrees of (dis)similarity between the virus families. Nevertheless, optimizing the predictive power for a single virus, e.g., SARS-CoV-2, requires a case-by-case experimental setup. Specifically in the case of SARS-CoV-2, one can potentially relax the leave-one-family-out evaluation, as we have prior knowledge about other species in its family, e.g., SARS and MERS, such as their interactions with hosts and protein functions (Thiel et al., 2003) . This is indeed a topic for further investigation. There are several limitations that can be addressed by future efforts. One is the scarcity of training data for inter-species PPIs and this may be leveraged by transfer learning on the much larger intra-species PPI data available for humans and other model organisms. We also ignored other types of PHIs outside virus-human interactions in our current study, such as those of other hosts, e.g., plants and fishes, and other pathogens, e.g., bacteria and fungi, which have been shown to improve the prediction performance for Ebola (but not H1N1) in a previous method (Zhou et al., 2018 ) (see Table 1 ; the training sets TR3 and TR4 contain host proteins from species other than human). Additionally, predicting tissue-specific PHIs would also provide additional insights, as proteins of both human (Fagerberg et al., 2014) and viruses (Jarosinski et al., 2012) often have tissue-specific expressions and functions.",
