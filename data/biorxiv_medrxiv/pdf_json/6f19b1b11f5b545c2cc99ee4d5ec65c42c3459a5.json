China implemented a quick strategy of suppression by locking the Wuhan province down on January 23 1 , and implementing social distancing procedures nationwide, with a successful outcome 2 . Still, the virus rapidly spread across the world through our increasingly interconnected flight network, and shortly arrived in Europe. In February 2020 the number of cases started to increase rapidly in some European countries. To limit the spread of the virus, European countries introduced non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) similar to China's. These NPIs include social distancing, school closures, limiting international travel and lockdown 3 . All of these NPIs result in behavioural changes, which can be traced through mobility data from tracking the location of mobile phones.",

The mobility data utilised here have some uncertainties and lack details but are the best openly available data source for tracking a population's movement in all eleven studied countries.

A limitation of their model is the assumption that each intervention has the same impact in all countries, ignoring cultural and sociological differences. In contrast, by utilizing country specific mobility data in a Bayesian framework 10 , we estimate the impact of each change in mobility pattern on R 0 . The resulting information provides an easy, straightforward way for governments to analyze if NPIs are working and to what extent.

We note that these two pairs of countries are close both geographically and culturally 22, 23 , possibly explaining the systematic differences. The differences may also be caused by differences in reporting between the countries 24, 25 . For instance, on April 5 more than 2000 deaths were reported in France, due to sudden inclusion of potential COVID-19 attributed deaths in nursing homes occuring at earlier dates 26 .",

Here, we present a model to estimate the effects of public interventions on the spread of COVID-19 that does not assume that interventions have identical effects in different geographical and cultural settings. In contrast, our model uses observational data of mobility patterns in five environments to estimate changes in the transmission rate. Our model creates the possibility to track rapid changes in spread, right now and predict their consequences three weeks ahead in time. This enables governments to use anonymous real-time data to adjust their policies. We do foresee that such models will become incrementally more powerful as more detailed mobility data becomes available in the future.",

The 50 % and 95 % confidence intervals are displayed in darker and lighter shades respectively, with the mean as a solid line. The histograms represent the number of cases and deaths reported by the European Center for Disease Control (ECDC). Mobility data for the five modelled sectors represented in terms of relative change compared to baseline (observed in a five-week period of 2020-01-03 to 2020-02-06) is displayed on the right axes. The dates for the introduction of different NPIs are marked with vertical lines. As can be seen, the NPIs have very strong implications for the mobility patterns.
