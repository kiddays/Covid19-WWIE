CRISPR RNAs (crRNA) against PB1 and highly conserved regions of PB2 were screened in conjunction with mRNA-encoded Cas13a. Screens were designed such that only guides that decreased influenza RNA levels in a Cas13-mediated fashion, were valid. Cas13a mRNA and validated guides, delivered post-infection, simulating treatment, were tested in combination and across multiplicities of infection. Their function was also characterized over time. Similar screens were performed for guides against SARS-CoV-2, yielding multiple guides that significantly impacted cytopathic effect. Last, the approach was utilized in vivo, demonstrating the ability to degrade influenza RNA in a mouse model of infection, using polymer-formulated, nebulizer-based mRNA delivery.",

It is estimated that viral infections contribute to approximately 6.6% of global mortality 3 . This is especially concerning, given that there are approximately 90 drugs (since 1963-2016) to treat only 9 viral species 4 . In addition, there are approved vaccines for only 15 viral species. Reassortment, antigenic shift and drift, for influenza, as well as antibody dependent enhancement (ADE) for SARS and possibly, SARS-CoV-2, pose challenges to vaccine development 5 6 . These factors likely contribute to epidemics and pandemics. Human health is thus under constant threat due to emerging and reemerging viral infections 7 . Outbreaks of Zika 8 , Ebola 9 , and the current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic 10 , and the potential for future influenza pandemics 11 , warrant the development of new classes of anti-viral drugs 4 . Current drug development is focused on small molecules and neutralizing antibodies, which require high doses or frequent re-dosing to obtain functional outcomes 12, 13 . Thus, it is crucial to address the need for antivirals that are broad spectrum, flexible and effective across multiple viral species or strains.",

Synthetic mRNA expression is transient, has very little chance of integrating, and innate immune responses can be mitigated through sequence design, modified nucleotides, and purification [20] [21] [22] .

To date, most studies only evaluate targeted reduction of RNA relative to the reduction due to a NTCR. Two additional controls were added, a mRNA expressing a \"dead\" or inactive Cas13a plus targeted guide, and a GFP encoding mRNA plus targeted guide. Each control yielded valuable information regarding how the guide was performing. The dead version gives insight into whether \"binding-only\" events may affect RNA levels, while the GFP control adds additional information regarding whether the guide alone has knockdown effects. If all the controls do not affect RNA levels and knockdown is only due to the active enzyme, then enzymatic action is driving the reduction. There are cases where the Cas13a inactive version may also decrease RNA levels ( Fig. 2 b) . This is not necessarily a problem per se, but this control group helps distinguish \"binding\" related knockdown from enzymatic effects.

In this experiment, 9 different guides were screened, by first transfecting Vero E6 cells overnight with the cytoplasmic version of Cas13a and guides, and then infecting with MOI=~0.1 of SARS-CoV-2. Note, only the cytoplasmic version was used, because the virus replicates in this cell compartment 26 . Prophylactic delivery was used because this virus exhibits very rapid kinetics in Vero E6 cells, as well as the fact that they are interferon deficient. In less permissive, less cytopathic susceptible cell types, we anticipate the post-infection approach to yield similar resultsto the influenza experiments.
