The statistic of COVID-19 across the world is reported daily, providing a dynamic perspective for each country. We tested the hypothesis that the vaccination against tuberculosis with BCG correlates with better outcomes for COVID-19 patients. To this end, we combined the information on demography, economy, major chronic diseases, and immunization policies with the COVID-19 outcomes. We filtered out at a fixed date all countries that were below a predetermined value for population size and number of COVID-19 deaths per million (DPM). Altogether, 55 countries, covering 62.9% of the world population, met our criteria and were analyzed. To allow a reliable comparison between countries, each was aligned to a critical alignment threshold date (0.5 DPM). We found that the years of BCG admission are negatively correlated with DPM at varying times post alignment. Results from multivariable regression tests with 22 quantitative properties of each country and its population substantiate the dominant contribution of BCG admission years to the COVID-19 outcomes. Analyzing countries according to an age group partition across several time-points, reveals that the strongest correlation is attributed to the coverage in BCG vaccination of the young population (<25 years), to a lesser degree the middle age group (25-64 years), while BCG coverage status of the elderly (>65 years) was insignificant. More specifically, the signal is attributed to recent immunizations (last 15 years) rather than past policies. We propose that BCG immunization coverage, especially among the most recently vaccinated, may contribute to attenuation of the COVID-19 spread and severity.",

The progression of COVID-19 pandemic in each country is estimated by the daily report compiled by the World Health Organization (WHO) and publically available through the Worldometers online resource (1) . The country-specific reports provide statistical information on the number of tests performed, the COVID-19 confirmed cases, the number of deaths, and the cumulative state of patients hospitalized in serious and critical condition. Along with the spread of the pandemic, most countries imposed a policy of social distancing and other measures to mitigate COVID-19. Despite the intense effort, the knowledge on the COVID-19 SARS-CoV-2 virus is fragmented and key epidemiological parameters are still missing (2) (3) (4) (5) (6) . With over 170k reported deaths and an average number of 21.7 deaths per million (DPM, as of April 20th, 2020), the death toll remains a reliable measure for monitoring the spread and progression of the disease across countries (7) . While for some European countries such as Belgium, Spain, and Italy the DPM is >400, other infected countries (e.g., Turkey, Israel, Hungary) are closer to the world average. The large differences in COVID-19 outcomes, even among neighboring countries (e.g., Spain and Portugal) are not likely to solely reflect differences in the regulations imposed by each country at the initial phase of the epidemic (8) .",

The Bacille Calmette-Gu\u00e9rin vaccine (BCG) contains a live attenuated strain of Mycobacterium bovis, is widely used to eradicate TB and was among the most broadly used vaccination throughout the 20th century in neonatal and young children. Despite its wide use in many developing countries, about 1% of the world population is infected with TB each year. While a constant reduction in death due to TB is observed in the last decade, the annual deaths exceeds 1.5M (9) , with a substantial overlap with people that are HIV infected (10, 11) . Currently, the BCG vaccine is provided to the entire population in most countries with high TB incidence (12) . Over the last two decades, numerous countries changed their policy and restricted BCG immunization policy to nonnative born migrants from high TB burden countries (13) . In this study, we questioned whether the longrange impact of the BCG vaccination regimes and the varied fraction of the population that is covered by BCG in different countries are linked with an improved COVID-19 outcome.",

For country-specific groups (binary or categorized, such as BCG administration), we applied the ranked Wilcoxon test as a nonparametric statistical test for comparing any paired groups. For the continuous (i.e. the number of years BCG was administered, the prevalence of TB in the population, median age) data we applied linear regression, reporting the regression fit and the calculated statistical significance (p-value) for the COVID-19 outcomes. A correlation between the BCG by age groups was determined by partitioning the population of each country into three groups: (i) 24 years and younger; (ii) 25 to 64 years; (iii) 65 years and older. From the age partition and the BCG coverage within each age group, a value that measures the percentage of the population in the share of the age group with BCG is calculated (see Supplemental Materials and Methods, S1-text).",

Fig. 5 shows the correlation of total years of BCG admission within the given timeframe of the age group, according to the country-based age composition, 15 days post alignment key dates. The population in each country was partitioned to young (<24 years of age), working class (25-64 years) and old (>65 years). Across several time points, the strongest correlation for BCG coverage for the age dependent was associated with the young group (Fig.  5a) , followed by the working class group (Fig 5b) . The correlation with the young age group (testing at 20 days) is highly significant with R = -0.53, p-value 0.00048. The highly statistically significant negative trend repeats among all dates tested within the 10-25 days post alignment.

We therefore divided the countries into 3 disjoined groups representing their vaccination policies over the past 15 years: (i) countries with mandatory immunization policies over the past 15 years; (ii) countries with mandatory immunization policies for less than 7.5 years within the past 15 years; (iii) countries with no mandatory immunization policies over the past 15 years.

            "text": "The significant strong correlation between the BCG vaccination and better outcomes for COVID-19 is shown across many countries, covering the majority of the world population (62.9%). This finding is based on an unbiased view of all countries that comply with predetermined thresholds on a minimum number of DPM and population size (see Materials and Methods). We anticipate that with the progression of COVID-19 pandemic more countries that are at an early phase of the pandemic could be included. Importantly, the strong negative correlation between the BCG admission years and DPM was sustained at a range of time-points (Fig. 3) . The trend was very similar for DPM or for accounting people that were hospitalized and are in serious and critical condition (SPM). The negative correlation to COVID-19 positive cases (CPM) is weaker relative to DPM. It reflects the varying capacities of different countries to carry the molecular tests (or lung CT pathology as a test) and more importantly the policy of who is being tested greatly varies. Weaker confidence was observed for people that were recovered (RPM). We assume it reflects the early stage of the pandemic in many countries. Furthermore, the non-standardized definition for COVID-19 confirmed recovery is likely to reduce the reliability of the RPM and eventually affect statistical power. Our multivariable analysis highlights the strength of combining a broad range of country-based quantitative observation (e.g., economic measures, number of doctors per 1000 people), and population composition including habits (smoking), exposure to infectious diseases (prevalence of TB) and several major comorbidities (e.g. cancer, diabetes). Many of these individual measures are correlated and may reflect confounding factors. For instance, countries that suffer from a high level of TB (19) are also marked by high immigration, social inequalities, high drug or alcohol abuse, and HIV infection (11) . Most importantly, the multivariable analysis validated the importance and statistical significance of BCG immunization years given the other variables, attributing better outcomes to them. As expected the median age was also extremely significant, with higher values strongly contributing to the worse COVID-19 outcome. The detailed information on the number of BCG admission years is used as an additional source of information that is unavailable when a binary definition of BCG immunization is considered. Detailed information on the exact years from first admission, the health policy in each country, and the actual immunization coverage (provided by the WHO) allowed a thorough inspection of the BCG vaccination by the population structure (Fig. 5) . We explicitly tested what component of the BCG immunization is most critical out of the COVID-19 outcomes. By partitioning the population to young, middle and elderly age groups, we confirmed that the strongest signal towards COVID-19 outcome is associated with the young (<24 years), then the middle age (25-64 years) while the elderly (>65 years) that are at highest risk for COVID-19 mortality do not correlate with BCG higher coverage. The implication of this observation for COVID-19 epidemiology is evident. It is likely that in countries where the young population (<24 years) is vaccinated maximal protection is provided. Universally, the DPM among young people is very low (0.04% for <17 years (14) ), their main contribution is expressed in sustaining the chain of infection. Higher coverage of young that leads to a lower death toll in the elderly population is most probably due to a lower rate of infection that is caused by the young group, leading to an overall lower death toll. The lack of correlation between BCG coverage of >65 years and COVID-19 outcomes is in accord with the expected negligible impact of the elderly population on the transmission within the community.",

Despite the broad usage of BCG for almost a century, the long-term effect of BCG on the immune system remains enigmatic. BCG was reported to have a protective function on various pathogens and was argued to act as a general systemic immunological stimulator. The indirect effects of BCG on diabetes, multiple sclerosis, and all-cause mortality of children in developing countries were reported (21) . We argue based on the age-partition analysis that the recent immunization in many of these countries rather than a long-term heterologous effect dominates. The strong statistical significance value for BCG being effective for the recently immunized population (0-15 years, Fig 4d) supports the hypothesis for a better outcome of COVID-19 is governs by recent BCG immunization (22) , the alternative view suggesting a lifetime activation of the system that awaits additional evidence. We conclude that the strong negative correlation with BCG administration years, the impact of a recent vaccination, and the validated role of the young population in the spread of COVID-19 are fundamental observations for revisiting global and national BCG immunization policy. While, at present, the WHO does not recommend BCG vaccination for prevention of COVID-19, several clinical trials with BCG are undertaken (23, 24) .",
