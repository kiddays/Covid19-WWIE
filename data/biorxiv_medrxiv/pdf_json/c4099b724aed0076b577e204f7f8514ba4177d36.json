A novel coronavirus, SARS-Cov-2, is the causative agent of severe pneumonia and rapidly spread through many nations, crashing health systems. In Brazil, the emergence of local epidemics in major metropolitan areas is a concern. In a huge and heterogeneous country, with regional disparities and climate diversity, several factors can modulate the dynamics of COVID-19. What should be the scenario for an inner Brazil and what can we do to control infection transmission in each one of these locations? In this paper, a mathematical model was developed to simulate disease transmission among individuals in several scenarios, differing by the intensity and type of control measures. Mitigation strategies rely on social distancing of all individuals, and detection and isolation of infected ones. The model shows that control effort varies among cities. The social distancing is the most efficient method to control disease transmission but improving detection and isolation of infected individuals can help loosening this mitigation strategy.",

The consequences of relaxing restrictions is a theme of debate now, and in Brazil it is happening before the peak of epidemic has occurred, while the number of cases still growing over the country.

Lages, however, belongs to the brazilian south region, where, in April, the predominance is cold and dry days. Several other abiotic factors can modulate disease transmission but the influence of it on R 0 is not established yet 14 . The range of R 0 is in agreement of what has been observed in Brazil and others countries for COVID-19.

Botucatu and Chapec\u00f3 have the same mean temperature, but as Botucatu is drier than the other, it is in a higher rank compared to Chapec\u00f3. At the other pole, the least infected cities have higher temperature and humidity: Mossor\u00f3, Caracara\u00ed, Patos, Parintins and Marab\u00e1. The result basically reproduces the rank of R 0 value of each city. The expression of R 0 was obtained from studies of COVID-19 transmission on China that suggest this relationship 13 . However, as know from many other respiratory diseases like influenza, climate variables are important factors that drive the spatio-temporal behaviour of the disease transmission, but are not the only ones. Also, the contribution of each factor still be a topic of research and it looks that they do not have the same impact when considering areas of temperate or tropical weather 14 . A general consensus is that they explain about 30% of disease incidence. When studying capitals cities of states of Brazil, we see that Fortaleza-CE and Manaus-AM are some of the most affected cities by COVID-19, respectively 3482 and 2160 confirmed cases, despite being hot and wet metropolitan areas. Studies crossing health status of population with socioeconomic dimension such as education, poverty and deprivation of resources and service put the states of Amaz\u00f4nia and Cear\u00e1 with bad index value, from -1 (the worst value of index) to 1 (the best value of the index), the municipalities that compose these two states have \u22120.77 \u00b1 0.12 and \u22120.63 \u00b1 0.09, respectively 16 .

So, we drawn scenarios with different strategies and interventions. We can clearly see that for each city, we have an optimal control measure, depending on the target. Hypothetically, lets consider that a reduction of 60% on the number of the cases is needed to control the epidemics in all the cities represented in Figure 4 . Patos would need a 50% reduction on the social contact, while Caracara\u00ed would need almost 60%.

This is the first paper describing mathematical models for small and medium cities of inner Brazil.
