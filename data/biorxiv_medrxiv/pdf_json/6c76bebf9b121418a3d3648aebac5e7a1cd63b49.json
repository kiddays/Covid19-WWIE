It is an infectious disease which is caused by newly discovered coronavirus. Our study demonstrates with a nonlinear model of this devastating COVID-19 which narrates transmission from human-to-human in the society. Pontryagin's Maximum principle has also been applied in order to obtain optimal control strategies where the maintenance of social distancing is the major control. The target of this study is to find out the most fruitful control measures of averting coronavirus infection and eventually, curtailed of the COVID-19 transmission among people. The model is investigated analytically by using most familiar necessary conditions of Pontryagin's maximum principle. Furthermore, numerical simulations have been performed to illustrate the analytical results. The analysis reveals that implementation of educational campaign, social distancing and developing human immune system are the major factors which can be able to plunge the scenario of becoming infected.",

            "text": "The recent outbreak of COVID-19 (coronavirus disease) has newly emerged at the end of 2019 in Wuhan (capital of Hubei province, China), which has now become a global pandemic. In 2003, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) Coronavirus first identified whereas first infected humans were detected in the Guangdong province of Southern China in 2002. Almost 26 countries affected by this SARS-CoV causing above 8000 cases in 2003 [24] . The newly emerged COVID-19 caused by coronavirus is genetically identical to SARS-CoV 2002. Hence, the scientists have named this virus as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS CoV-2). It is thought that SARS-CoV is an animal virus from an animal reservoir, probably bats that spread to other animal like civet cats. COVID-19 is a human-to-human transmittable disease. It seems to have occurred mainly during the second week of illness. The symptoms of this disease include fever, malaise, myalgia, cough, shortness of breath, diarrhoea, headache and shivering. There is no specific symptom for the diagnosis of SARS. Though fever is the most frequent symptom but in adult and immunosuppressed patients it is most often absent on initial stage.",

Among which about 76,408 people got recovered whereas almost 3,318 people died from this devastating disease [11] . But the wonderful matter is that the currently infected populations have been decreased because of the implementation of proper measures and consciousness among people in China. Besides, on 13 March, World Health Organization declared Europe as the most epicenter of COVID-19 the pandemic disease. Among European countries, Italy has the most cases outside of China followed by Spain, Germany, France, Switzerland, Netherlands, Austria, and Belgium. But now the scenario has completely been changed. At present United States has become the top spot in the case of COVID-19 related incidence and death in the world.",

[1] developed a SEIR model for infectious diseases and also employed optimal control strategy introducing state constraints on the model. In this continuation, Biswas et al. [9] proposed a nonlinear model to show the optimal immunotherapeutic treatment for HIV. See also Biswas [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] where he showed mastery knowledge in investigating and analyzing the mechanisms of the most devastating diseases in which mathematical modeling and optimal control technique acted as the key tool. Several well documented models of COVID-19 have been presented as well. Kucharski et al. [17] studied a mathematical model on early dynamics of transmission and control of COVID-19. Zhuang et al. [31] estimated the COVID 19 cases by the imported cases and air travel data from Iran to other Middle East countries. Zhang et al. [30] presented a data-driven analysis on the estimation on the reproductive number of COVID-19 and the probable outbreak size on the Diamond Princess cruise ship. A modeling study on domestic and international spread of COVID-19 has been analyzed by in detail Wu et al. [25] . Lin et al. [21] proposed a conceptual model for the COVID-19 outbreak in Wuhan with the consideration of individual behavioral reaction and governmental actions. Zhang et al. [29] developed a new psychological crisis intervention model by utilizing internet technology. Khan and Atangana [18] modeled the dynamics of novel coronavirus with fractional derivative. They applied the Atangana-Baleanu derivative because of their kernel being nonlocal and nonsingular and also for their crossover behavior. An accurate early forecasting model from small dataset regarding nCOVID-19 has been analyzed by Fong et al. [15] . Readers can also follow (Zhao et al. [27] ; Zhao et al. [28] ; Sookaromdee and Wiwanitkit [23] ; Chen et al. [14] ; Chen and Yu [13] ; Xu et al. [26] ; Khatun and Biswas [19, 20] and references within) for more detailed information about novel coronavirus (COVID-19) as well as very recent implementation of modeling and optimal control techniques.",

As part of this coordinated approach, we present a mathematical model of novel coronavirus to show the transmission which can be controlled effectively by maintaining social distancing as well as treatment. In this study, we analyze the mathematical modeling of COVID-19 and also apply optimal control theory introducing three controls to prevent the transmission of this severe infectious disease. Finally we perform numerical simulations to interpret the outcomes and also to show the effectiveness of the controls in preventing and/or curing the infection. The main aim of this work is to minimize the infection by applying the controls and also the associated cost of the implementation of the three controls measures.",

Besides, other parts in Europe the cases have been becoming soared nowadays. As for example, currently United Kingdom has 29,474 incidences, followed by Switzerland at 17,781, Belgium at 15,348, Netherlands at 13,614, and Austria at 10,842. But it is noticeable that the death rate in USA is lower than Italy. The COVID 19 related death rate is very high in Italy (at 13,155) followed by Spain at 10,003, France at 4,032 and the COVID 19 related recovery rate is raised in China (at about 76,408) followed by Spain at 26,743, Italy at 16,847. The detailed about coronavirus related cases, deaths from the disease and recovered rate are presented in Figure 1 [10] . The novel coronavirus-2 disease (COVID 19) is mysterious because it transmits only through eyes, nose and mouth of the human being and directly targets our lunge. Initially, COVID 19 emerged in China and from there the devastating disease spread out almost 206 countries in the world. Present scenario of COVID 19 related incidence and death rate are shown in Figure 2 [11] . The deadly coronavirus has also broken out in Bangladesh along with other countries in the world. The first coronavirus cases in Bangladesh have been noticed on 8 March 2020 and since then it has been spread out across the country. Now this disease has become an epidemic in Bangladesh. At the beginning of infection in Bangladesh only three persons were affected by this novel coronavirus but the infection has risen considerably. On 16 March, there were about five persons infected from COVID 19 but it had increased on 23 March by nine persons. By this time, about 6 patients have died from this fatal disease COVID 19. However, the biggest problem here is that the new incidence rate is increasing day by day. The present status of COVID 19 cases from March 8 to April 3 are exhibited in Figure 3 [12] .

Furthermore, we perform the simulation of model (3) with control variables (such as educational campaign, social distancing and treatment). In this case, the results for each compartment are presented in Figures  6-9 . Graphical outcomes are executed using the initial values: (3) with control, we simulate the optimal systems when all the three control variables (such as educational campaign, social distancing and treatment control) for coronavirus-2 disease (COVID 19) are employed. This time, we first run the program for the quarantined individuals for both cases (i.e. with and without control). Hence, the simulated outcome is illustrated in Figure 6 . Basically, we adopt this in order to see the comparison of the different individuals (quarantined, infected, isolated and recovered individuals) for with and without control in the same window.

Figure 5 shows that the number of quarantined and infected individuals increases for first two days but probably in day three, it slightly reduces. From day five, the number of quarantined and infected individuals starts to grow whereas the number of isolated and recovered individuals soars from the initial state. However, it is noticeable that the number of susceptible individuals rises up for the first two days but for the next two days it decreases abruptly. Then it remains steady. This means that as the quarantined and infected individuals increase, the more individuals become isolated to get medical treatment as well as maintenance of social distancing, the more individuals get recovered. Figure 6 illustrates the influences of educational campaign and social distancing control on the quarantined individuals for 60 days timeline. Here, it has been noticed that both the three control measures significantly control the number of quarantined individuals. The effects of the three controls are obvious in the figure. The number of quarantined individuals rises up when no control is employed but with the application of controls though it shows a slight decrease in days 1-3 and 9-10, it sharply plunges for the other time interval.",

Figure 7 shows the influences of educational campaign, social distancing and treatment control on the infected individuals for 60 days timeline. From the figure, it has been observed that the number of infected individuals increases in the absence of control but when all three controls are employed, it shows a decreasing effect for the first eleven days and then gradually goes up. The reason behind the rise may be that the influence of educational campaign and treatment are not enough effective on infected individuals as no specific treatment for COVID-19 exists. Figure 8 demonstrates the effects of three control measures such as educational campaign, social distancing and treatment control on the number of isolated individuals for 60 days timeline. In this case, it has been seen that the three control measures remarkably influences the isolated individuals. The isolated individual goes up with time without controls whereas it initially increases but gradually goes down for the first ten days and then it soars for the rest timeline with the application of the three controls.

Figure 9 depicts the effects of three control measures such as educational campaign, social distancing and treatment control on the number of recovered individuals for 60 days timeline. In this case, it is noticeable that the three control measures have significant influence on the recovered individuals. In the absence of control the number of recovered individuals is nearly zero for first ten days, then it shows a slight increase up to twenty days and finally it goes up. But this increase is lower than the expectation and also it is too small compared to the number of infected and isolated individuals. Hence to get the desired result, three controls have been employed and the recovered individuals swiftly booms for the implementation of educational campaign and social distancing as a prevention and treatment as cure of the disease COVID 19.",

It is assumed that if the present trend of COVID-19 outbreak continues, then obviously humanity could face its most devastating pandemic. As there is no proper treatment with drugs or vaccines until to date, social distancing and educational campaign are the only ways to prevent and control people from being affected. Such a control strategy via mathematical modeling is discussed in the present study. The model is formulated considering three control variables by using the most well-known Pontryagin's Maximum Principle. Numerical simulations have been performed to illustrate the analytic results. After investigation, it is observed that social distancing and educational campaign as prevention and treatment as cure are much more effective for the reduction of quarantined, infected and isolated individuals and at the same time the recovered individuals show a remarkable ascendancy. Since no antiviral medication (vaccination / natural health products) is authorized to treat or protect against COVID-19, implementation of educational campaign, social distancing and developing human immune system may be the best ways for preventing the disease before it goes out of control. Therefore, it is high time we took effective and strict measures to combat against this most devastating disease. analyzed the model analytically and wrote some literature of the study. Author AKP wrote the programming codes and performed some part of the computational analysis. Authors MAI and SAS contributed to literature searches and calculated the real data to estimate the parameters, UG verified the parameters and checked the literature. All authors have read and agreed to the publish the final version of the manuscript.",
