As the mean time from onset to death was 23.7 days, there was a very low potential benefit of tracheotomy prior to this time. 44 Early evidence from Wuhan shows that the time from hospital admission to death was log normally distributed with mean 11 days and median 5 days. However, this data not reach statically significance (p = 0.56). 45 Givi et al. suggests delaying most tracheostomy procedures beyond 14 days, first of all given the high infectious risks during the procedure, arguing that early phases of COVID-19 infection may be related to a higher viral load. Secondly, given that after 14 days the likelihood of recovery is higher, and the ventilator weaning has become the primary goal of care. 9 A recent systematic review suggested that early tracheostomy, performed in the first 7 days after orotracheal intubation, is associated with a reduction of mechanical ventilation duration, mortality rate and length of stay in ICU irrespective of reason for admission. 46 By contrast, a previous randomized clinical trial, did not show an improved mortality rate or reduced length of ICU stay in patients on mechanical ventilation that underwent early tracheostomy. 47 Furthermore, a meta-analysis of .

The lower channel is equipped with a distal cuff positioned just above the carina that may allow a safe mechanical ventilation by keeping stable gas-exchange and limiting the spread of aerosol during the procedure. 51,52 However, authors recommend considering either open tracheostomy or percutaneous tracheostomy at the discretion of the faculty performing the procedure, and according to departmental experience.",
