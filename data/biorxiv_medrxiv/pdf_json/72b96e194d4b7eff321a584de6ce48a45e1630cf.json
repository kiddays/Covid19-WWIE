Among them are also enzymes altering the 21 host-ubiquitination system including bacterial ligases and deubiquitinases. In this study, based on 22 homology-detection screening on 305 Legionella effector proteins, we identified two Legionella 23 OTU-like deubiquitinases (LOT; LotB (Lpg1621/Ceg23) and LotC (Lpg2529), LotA 24 (Lpg2248/Lem21) is already known). A crystal structure of LotC catalytic core (LotC14-310) was 25 determined at 2.4 \u212b and compared with other OTU deubiquitinases, including LotB. Unlike the 26 classical OTU-family, the structures of Legionella OTU-family (LotB and LotC) shows an 27 extended helical lobe between the Cys-loop and the variable loop, which define a novel class of 28 OTU-deubiquitinase. Despite structural differences in their helical lobes, both LotB and LotC 29 interact with ubiquitin. LotB has an additional ubiquitin binding site (S1') enabling specific 30 cleavage of Lys63-linked poly-ubiquitin chains. By contrast, LotC only contains the S1 site and 31 cleaves different species of ubiquitin chains. MS analysis of catalytically inactive LotB and LotC 32 identified different categories of host-substrates for these two related DUBs. Together, our results 33 provide new structural insights of bacterial OTU deubiquitinases and indicate distinct roles of 34 bacterial deubiquitinases in host-pathogen interactions. 35",

To define the minimal OTU domain for 163 biochemical and structural studies, we designed several constructs and tested their activity against 164 the di-Ub panel (Fig. 3a, b) . While LotC retained its activity with the predicted OTU domain (7-165 310), LotB lost its activity after deletion of 50 amino acids (300-350) located at the C-terminus 166 beyond the predicted OTU domain (11-283). Based on the LotB structure (PDB:6KS5, (Ma et al., 167 2020)), we assumed that this extra helical region might be required for the additional ubiquitin 168 binding site (S1') to accept the distal ubiquitin moiety from K63 Ub2 (Fig. 3c) . To understand the 169 detailed mechanism of linkage specificity of LotB and LotC at the molecular level, we determined 170 the crystal structure of the catalytic domain of LotC (LotC14-310) at 2.4 \u212b (Fig. 3d features in the S1 ubiquitin-binding site (Fig. 3c , d and Table 1 ). Whereas the overall fold of the 174 catalytic core of LotB and LotC resembles that of other OTU-deubiquitinases, both showed clear 175 differences in the helical arm region, which has been shown to interact with ubiquitin and it serves 176 as an S1 binding site (Mevissen et al., 2013) .

Ubiquitin 218 (UBA52) is strongly enriched with both catalytically inactive LotB and LotC (Fig. 5a, c) . MS 219 analysis revealed that LotB mainly interacts with membrane protein complexes (COPB1, ATP5B, 220 ATP5H, COX5A, SEC61B). We also found interactions with some ER-resident proteins (Calnexin 221 (CANX), DDOST, STT3A). By contrast, most of the enriched proteins from the inactive LotC 222 pull-down were non-membrane-bound organelle-and ribosome-related proteins (RPS8, RPLP2, 223 RPS27, RPLP1, RPL13) (Fig. 5a, c) . To further understand this, we sought to find the cellular 224 localization of both DUBs (Fig. 5b, d) . Consistent with the recent publication, LotB specifically 225 co-localized with the ER marker protein Calnexin, but not with other organelle markers (TOMM20 226 and GM130 for Mitochondria and Golgi, respectively, Fig. 5b) , and the OTU domain itself failed 227 to localize on the ER (Supplementary Fig. 4a ). By contrast, we could not find a specific cellular 228 localization of LotC (Fig. 5d) . Next, to gain more insights into the functional roles of LotB and 229",

Together, these findings establish important guidance on how to screen for more DUBs in 254 other pathogenic bacteria or viruses, how to characterize their physiological roles during infection. 255 We also showed that the two Legionella OTUs have different ubiquitin-binding modes 256 that enable them to cleave specific ubiquitin chains. With ubiquitin activity-based probes (Prg-, 257 VME-probes), we showed that LotB contains an extra ubiquitin-binding site (S1') and is specific 258 to K63-linked ubiquitin chains, wherease LotC cleaves different types of ubiquitin chains. 259",

            "text": "-mediated cellular process is the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS), where misfolded 43 proteins get ubiquitinated and degraded by the proteasome, and recycled (Dikic, 2017). For the 44 larger cellular wastes, such as cellular components (ER, mitochondria etc.), protein aggregates or 45 intracellular bacteria, ubiquitination works together with the autophagy machinery, which includes 46 sequestration of ubiquitinated components and their transfer into the lysosome for degradation 47 (Pohl and Dikic, 2019). To maintain homeostasis in the cell, ubiquitination events are tightly 48 regulated by a reverse process called deubiquitination, where ubiquitin molecules from target 49 substrates are specifically cleaved and recycled by deubiquitinating enzymes (deubiquitinases; 50 DUBs) (Clague et al., 2019). 51 To date, about 100 different deubiquitinases (DUBs) have been identified from human. 52 They are categorized into seven different classes, based on their structure and mechanism of 53 actions including USP, JAMM (MPN), OTU, MJD (Josepin), UCH and the recently discovered 54 MINDY and ZUFSP (Abdul Rehman et al., 2016; Clague et al., 2019; Haahr et al., 2018; 55 Hermanns et al., 2018; Hewings et al., 2018; Kwasna et al., 2018). Six of them belong to the 56 cysteine protease family (USP, OTU, MJD(Josepin), UCH, MINDY and ZUFSP), while JAMM 57 Identification of two novel OTU-like deubiquitinases from Legionella effector proteins 109 To identify putative deubiquitinases amongst Legionella effector proteins, we analyzed effector 110 proteins from L. pneumophlia (Lpg genes). Based on the type IV Icm/Dot complex secretion signal 111 (> 2.0), 305 effector proteins were selected (Burstein et al., 2016). Using pairwise sequence-112 structure comparison based on hidden Markov models (HMMs, HHpred suite) (Zimmermann et 113 al., 2018), revealed four previously uncharacterized proteins as putative deubiquitinases. These 114 proteins all contain catalytic domains of known deubiquitinases(Fig. 1a). Lpg1621(Ceg23) and 115Lpg2529 are found as members of OTU-family, whereas Lpg2411 and Lpg2907 belong to the 116 UCH and CE-clan, respectively(Fig. 1b, Table 1). An in vitro di-ubiquitin cleavage assay with di-117Ub panel (eight different linkage-specific Ub2 chains(El Oualid et al., 2010)) showed that the OTU-118 like DUBs (Lpg1621 and Lpg2529) are capable of cleaving Ub2 chains with different specificity, 119 while other candidates (Lpg2411 and Lpg2907) did not show catalytic activity (Supplementary 120 Fig. 1a). The OTU family deubiquitinases have been shown to have linkage specificity against 121 certain polyubiquitin chains (Mevissen et al., 2016, 2013). To address whether Lpg1621 and 122 Lpg2529 follow this fundamental rule, we performed a time-course in vitro DUB assay with di-123 Ub panel (Fig. 1c-f). Consistent with the recent evidence, Lpg1621 exclusively processed the K63-124 linked Ub2 (Ma et al., 2020), while Lpg2529 showed activity against K6-, K11-, K33-, K48-and 125 Prg and ubiquitin-Prg after 30 minutes of reaction, while LotC was modified only with ubiquitin. 155",

To do this, we co-transfected the cells with one of the Lot-DUBs and 231 previously known Legionella E3 ligases (SidC or SdcA) (Hsu et al., 2014; Wasilko et al., 2018). 232 We chose these two ligases because their cellular substrates are poorly studied. TMT-labelled 233 samples from cells expressing either SidC or SdcA alone, or together with a catalytically inactive 234 mutant of LotB or LotC, were prepared (four combinations; SidC-LotB, SidC-LotC, SdcA-LotC 235 or SdcA-LotC, Fig. 5e, f, Supplementary Fig. 5a-d). Interestingly, we identified a distinct sub-236 class of substrates. Overall, a smaller number of proteins were enriched with LotB compared to 237 LotC. We reasoned that LotB specifically interacts with proteins modified with K63-linked 238 ubiquitin chains, while LotC interacts with different types of ubiquitin chains. Intriguingly, we 239 found a significant number of ribosome-structural proteins in LotC:SdcA combination, which were 240 not enriched in SidC background.

We have also shown that LotB and LotC are specific to certain 251 ubiquitin chains and have a distinct cellular localization.

OTUD4 has been shown to deubiquitinate K63-linked chains of 274 myeoloid differentiation primary response 88 (MYD88) and to downregulate NF-kB-dependent 275 inflammation. While the recent study on LotB showed that there is no detectable inhibition of NF-276 kB reporter expression(Ma et al., 2020), further studies are awaited to show the cross-talk between 277 LotB and host ubiquitination system. 278 Legionella pneumophila has been shown to possess multiple genes altering the host 279 ubiquitination system. However, little is known about functional cross-talk between ubiquitin 280 ligases and deubiquitinases. To understand the combinatorial effects of Legionella ubiquitin 281 ligases and deubiquitinases, we analyzed the interactome of LotB/LotC with host proteins in the 282 presence or absence of Legionella ligases (SidC and SdcA). We could see clear differences in the 283 number of enriched proteins in different combinations. Interestingly, we saw the clear difference 284 in the number of enriched proteins. A significant number of ribosomal proteins were enriched with 285 LotC in the background of SdcA, but not from SidC background, which has 71 % sequence 286 similarity to SdcA. This finding suggests distinct physiological roles of SdcA and SidC, and a 287 putative relationship between LotC and SdcA on regulating translation processes. Since LotC 288 processes different types of ubiquitin chains, and is mainly localized to the cytosol, a catalytically 289 dead version of LotC can be used as a standard tool for the identification of specific substrates of 290 other known Legionella ligases. It would be interesting to understand how all these used in this study were expressed and purified as previously described (Bhogaraju et 297 al., 2016; Qiu et al., 2016). Lpg1621 (LotB), Lpg2529 (LotC), Lpg2411 and Lpg2907 were cloned 298 into either pParallelGST2 or pParallelHis2 vector (Sheffield et al., 1999).

The systems were built using the CHARMM-GUI webserver (Wu et al., 375 2014). The systems were hydrated with 150 mM NaCl electrolyte. The all-atom CHARMM36m 376 force field was used for proteins, lipids and ions, and TIP3P was used for water molecules (Best 377 et al., 2012). The MD trajectories were analyzed with Visual Molecular Dynamics (VMD) 378 (Humphrey et al., 1996). The MD simulations were performed using GROMACS 2019 (Abraham 379 et al., 2015). The starting system was minimized for 5,000 steps with the steepest descent energy 380 minimization and equilibrated for 6.5 ns of MD simulation first in the NVT ensemble (1.5 ns) and 381 then in the NPT (5 ns) ensemble, in which all non-hydrogen atoms of the protein were restrained 382 to the fixed reference positions with progressively reduced force constants, starting at 1000 383 2 . Afterwards, the production runs were carried out in the NPT ensemble for 600 ns 384 for each setup. To keep the C-terminusof ubiquitin in the catalytic site, 7-\u00c5 wall restraints were 385 placed on the distance between C\u03b1 of G76UB and Cys29/His270 in LotB and between C\u03b1 of G76UB 386 and Cys16/His296 in LotC. Periodic boundary conditions were used. Particle mesh Ewald (Darden 387 et al., 1993) with cubic interpolation and 0.12 nm grid spacing for Fast Fourier Transform was 388 used to treat long-range electrostatic interactions. The time step was 2 fs. The LINCS algorithm 389 (Hess et al., 1997) was used to fix all bond lengths. Constant temperature (310 K) was set with a 390 Nos\u00e9-Hoover thermostat (Hoover, 1985), with a coupling constant of 1.0 ps. An isotropic 391 Parrinello-Rahman barostat (Parrinello and Rahman, 1981) with a coupling constant of 5.0 ps was 392 used to maintain a pressure of 1 bar. 393 394 Identification of novel substrates of LotB and LotC 395 For interactome analysis, HEK 293 cells were transfected with FLAG-LotB WT/C29A or FLAG-396 LotC WT/C24A. To identify the substrates modified by Legionella derived E3 ligases, GFP-SidC 397 or GFP-SdcA were co-transfected with FLAG-LotB WT/C29A or FLAF-LotC WT/C24A. 398 Cells were lysed in ice cold lysis buffer (50mM Tris-Cl, p.H 7.5; 150mM NaCl; 1% Triton x-100) 399 and equal amount of lysates were incubated with FLAG-M2 beads in IP buffer (Lysis buffer 400 without detergent). After incubation, IPs were washed with wash buffer (50mM Tris-Cl, pH7.5; 401 400mM NaCl; 0.5mM EDTA) and the interacting proteins were eluted with 8M urea solution. 402 After the reduction and alkylation with TCEP and Chloroacetamide, the samples were digested 403 with 0.5ug Trypsin (Promega) at 37 o C overnight after diluting the urea < 2M. Digests were 404 acidified using trifluoroaceticacid (TFA) to a pH of 2-3, and the peptides were enriched using C18 405 stage tips (Rappsilber et al., 2003). To get quantitative information, peptides were either labelled 406 with TMT 10 plex reagent (Thermo fisher) or analyzed label-free. The peptides were separated on 407 an in-house made C18 column (20 cm length, 75 \u03bcm inner diameter, 1.9 \u03bcm particle size) by an 408 easy n-LC 1200 (ThermoFisher) and directly injected in a QExactive-HF or in case of TMT 409 samples into a Fusion Lumos mass-spectrometer (ThermoFisher) and analyzed in data-dependent 410 mode. Data analysis was done using Maxquant 1.65 (Cox and Mann, 2008). Fragment spectra 411 were searched against Homo sapiens SwissProt database (TaxID:9606, version 2018). Label-free 412 quantification was done with MaxLFQ (Cox et al., 2014) method with activated match between 413 runs. TMT-labelled samples were analysed by using TMT 10 Plex option within the software. 414 were transfected with FLAG-LotB or FLAG-LotC by GeneJuice transfection reagent 419 (Merck) for 24 h and fixed by 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 min. After fixation, cells were 420 permeabilized and blocked by 0.1% saponin and 1% BSA in PBS for 1 h at room temperature. 421 Cells were incubated with anti-Flag antibody (Sigma and Cell Signaling), with either anti-calnexin 422 antibody (Abcam), anti-TOMM20 antibody (Abcam), or anti-GM130 (BD Transduction 423 Laboratories) at 4 \u2103 overnight. Alexa Fluor 488 and Alexa Fluor 546 (Invitrogen) secondary 424 antibody were incubated for 1 h at room temperature. Images were acquired by the Zeiss LSM780 425 microscope system with 63\u00d7 1.4 NA oil immersion objective and further analyzed by Yuxin-Mao for providing SidC and SdcA clones and Stefan Knapp for the advice in 431 structure determination and sharing synchrotron time.

Based on this observation, we wondered whether LotA, another Legionella OTU-182 deubiquitinase(Kubori et al., 2018), also contains a longer insertion in the same region.Based on 183 the catalytic cysteine and histidine residues of the two OTU domains on LotA (Hermanns and 184 Hofmann, 2019), we analyzed the sequence and found that both OTU domains of LotA also contain 185 the longer insertion between the Cys loop and the variable loop (179 and 178 amino acids, 186 respectively; Fig. 3e). Together, our results identify Lot-DUBs as a novel class of the OTU-family 187 with longer insertions in the helical lobe region (Supplementary Fig.3a). 188 Novel structural fold of S1-ubiquitin binding sites on Legionella OTUs 190 Both LotB and LotC have extended helices, specifically near the S1 ubiquitin binding site and we 191 wondered how these regions interact with ubiquitin. To address this, we performed ubiquitin 192 docking into both LotB and LotC, followed by molecular dynamics (MD) simulations for 600 ns 193 (Fig. 4a-d). The final models showed that ubiquitin indeed makes contacts with the additional 194 helical regions of both LotB and LotC. In LotB, Phe143 and Met144 make hydrophobic 195 interactions with ubiquitin (Phe45 and Ala46). In addition to these interactions, we also found 196 another hydrophobic patch in LotB (Ile238, Val247, Ala248, Ile264, Ala266) interacting with 197 ubiquitin (Leu71, Leu73). For LotC, we identified several hydrophobic interactions of the 198 extended helical region (Tyr119, Tyr149) with ubiquitin (Ile44). During the simulation, C-199 terminus of ubiquitin (Arg72, Arg74) formed transient electrostatic interactions with LotC 200was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder. All rights reserved.

To validate the interactions observed in the simulations, we introduced several 201 mutations to the binding interface of both LotB and LotC, and performed a ubiquitin-cleavage 202 assay(Fig.4e, f). Consistent with a recent study(Ma et  al., 2020), mutations of both F143 and M144 203 decreased the catalytic activity of LotB. Interestingly, mutations of the newly identified 204 hydrophobic patch (I238, A266) also decreased the catalytic activity. For LotC, the mutations in 205 the hydrophobic patch (Y119, Y149) also affected the catalytic activity of LotC. Remarkably, a 206 single mutation on E153 completely abolished the catalytic activity, which indicates that the 207 electrostatic interactions are important for the correct docking of the ubiquitin C-terminus to the 208 catalytic pocket of LotC. This observation also explains the result observed in ubiquitin-like 209 protein ABP assays with LotC (Fig. 2g). The NEDD8, which has alanine instead of Arg72 in 210 ubiquitin, showed no modification towards LotC (Supplementary Fig. 2c). Together, our results 211 reveal how the extra helical lobes of the Lot-DUBs interact with ubiquitin and how they differ 212 within the Legionella OTU family. 213 Physiological roles of LotB and LotC 215",
