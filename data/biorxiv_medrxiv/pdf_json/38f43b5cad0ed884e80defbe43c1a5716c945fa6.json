We used an original patient isolate of SARS-CoV-2 (BetaCoV/Belgium/GHB-03021/2020) that was passaged on HuH7 and Vero-E6 cells ( Fig. S1 and Fig. S2A ). For full characterization and to exclude possible contaminants, we performed deep sequencing on the inoculum that was used to infect the animals (Fig. S2A) . No adventitious agents could be detected (data not shown). However, two in-frame deletions in the N-terminal domain and the furin-cleavage site of Spike (S) glycoprotein (9aa and 5aa, respectively) had occurred between cell culture passage P4 and P6 [8] [9] [10] , likely as adaptation to growth in Vero-E6 cells in vitro (Fig. S2B ).",

Hamsters were sacrificed on day 4 p.i. with passage 4 SARS-CoV-2 and lungs were stained with H&E and scored for signs of lung damage (apoptotic bodies, necrotizing bronchiolitis, edema, pneumonia and inflammation). Scores are calculated as percentage of the total maximal score. (G) Levels of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-9 levels in lung homogenates of SARS-CoV-2 infected hamsters, relative to non-infected controls of the same strain. Values for infected animals (n=7 each) compiled from two independent experiments using either P4 (n=3, circles) and P6 (n=4, squares) SARS-CoV-2. Statistical significance was calculated between infected and noninfected animals within each group. The data shown are mean \u00b1 SEM. Statistical significance between groups was calculated by the nonparametric Mann-Whitney U-test (ns P > 0.05, * P < 0.05, ** P < 0.01, **** P < 0.0001).",

Likewise, HCS treatment modulated, at least to some extent, the observed gene expression patterns (Fig. 1F and Fig. S5, Cluster 2) as shown by decreasing Akt1 (p=0.034) or increasing DDX58 (RIG-I, p=0.028) and cGAS (MB21D1, p=0.094) mRNA levels. In summary, our data are in line with restriction of SARS-CoV-2 infection by the interferon system in mice, and that the inflammatory response correlates with an increased virus replication. However, due to the limited virus replication, mice were considered as a poor model to study COVID-19pathogenesis, or to assess the efficacy of vaccines and treatments.In contrast, Syrian hamsters have been reported to be highly susceptible to SARS-CoV-1 18 and SARS-CoV-219 and might thus provide a small animal model to study SARS-CoV-induced pathogenicity and the involvement of the immune response in aggravating lung disease. We compared virus replication levels and lung pathology in WT hamsters and hamsters with ablated Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription 2 (STAT2 -/lacking type I and III IFN signaling) 20,21 and IL28R expression (IL28R-a -/lacking IFN type III signaling) (Fig. 2A). In contrast to mice, intranasal inoculation of SARS-CoV-2 in WT hamsters resulted in high viral RNA loads (Fig. 2B and Fig. S6) and infectious titers(Fig. 2C)in the lungs. Also, a marked lung pathology [median cumulative score (MCS) 9 out of maximal score of 18; IQR=8.5-10.5 (P4 virus)] characterized by a multifocal necrotizing bronchiolitis, massive leukocyte infiltration and edema (Fig. 2DandFig. S7A and S7B). This resembles histopathological findings in humans suffering from severe bronchopneumonia22 .",

Inversely, the observed lung pathology was much attenuated in STAT2 -/hamsters [MCS=3; IQR=1.5-3 (P4 virus)] with a limited infiltration of polymorphonuclear leukocytes the detection of few apoptotic bodies in the bronchus walls (Fig. 2D and Fig. S7B).On the contrary, IL28R-a -/hamsters showed clear signs of bronchopneumonia and peribronchiolar inflammation, yet of an intermediate score [MCS=7; IQR=6.5-7 (P4 virus)](Fig. 2D and Fig. S7B).",

In the upper airways, no differences were observed between WT and STAT2 -/hamsters, whereas IL28R-a -/hamsters presented with an obvious dilation of bronchi (Fig. 3A and 3C). Further quantitative analysis34 revealed an increase of the non-aerated lung volume in SARS-CoV-2-infected WT and IL28R-a -/hamsters, yet again not in STAT2 -/hamsters(Fig. 3D, Fig. S9B). Hence apart from lung consolidations and airway dilation as the main observed pathology, marked differences in other micro-CT-derived markers of specific lung pathology, such as hyperinflation, emphysema, or atelectasis34,35 could not be observed, except in one animal that presented with hyperinflation (Fig. S9CandFig. S10A-C).

Transgenic mice expressing hACE2, the bona fide receptor of SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 36 , have been suggested as COVID-19 model. We here demonstrate that also WT mice are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection, yet resulting in very limited viral replication and inflammatory responses. Ablation of type I interferon signaling in Ifnar -/mice results in the same small incremental 10-fold increase in viral replication as was reported for SARS-CoV-2 in hACE2 transgenic mice 36,37 . Most likely, neither mouse model will fully recapitulate pathogenesis of COVID-19, nor allow the study of clinical SARS-CoV-2 isolates. By contrast, SARS-CoV-2 infection and associated pathology in hamsters seems to resemble what has been reported for SARS-CoV-1 in the same model. An early peak of active virus replication was noted in the lungs with viremia and extra-pulmonary spread. This was accompanied by a strong acute inflammatory response 18 (as visualized by histopathology), the levels of which were correlated with those of MMP-9, a clinically relevant biomarker. Furthermore, micro-CT as established in this study may become a key instrument to non-invasively and quantitatively monitor SARS-CoV-2 lung disease. This will allow to conveniently monitor the effect of therapeutic strategies and test the preclinical efficacy of vaccine candidates. By using unique knock-out hamster lines, we demonstrated that STAT2 plays a critical role in mediating antiviral responses and restricting systemic dissemination of SARS-CoV-2. This is in line with the effect of STAT1 in a mouse model of SARS-CoV-1 infection 38 . However and much in contrast to what is generally observed for viral infections in Stat2 -/mice 39 or STAT2 -/hamsters 21,40,41 , the severe pathology induced by SARS-CoV-2 in WT hamsters is not observed in the absence of STAT2. Indeed, pneumonia as assessed by sensitive micro-CT was absent in STAT2 -/hamsters. Considering the negative regulation of IL-6 and other mediators of inflammation by STAT2 39,42 , our hamster model may help to understand the immune pathogenesis of Acute Lung Injury (ALI) caused by highly-pathogenic coronaviruses 18,23,43 as well as other respiratory viruses 4 .",
