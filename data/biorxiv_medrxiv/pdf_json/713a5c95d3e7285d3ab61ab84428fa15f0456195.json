With immediate availability and established safety profiles, approved antiviral drugs were targeted with the desire to find effective anti-SARS-CoV-2 drugs in the shortest time possible [5] . However, none of the most promising antiviral drugs for COVID-19 has been proved effective yet. Most published findings for the antiviral treatment of COVID-19 were based on the individual case reports or cellular antiviral results [6, 7] . Despite the lack of convincing evidence, Lopinavir/Ritonavir was quickly selected and recommended as an antiviral drug for COVID-19 in China since January. So far, only limited observations of Lopinavir/Ritonavir for coronavirus in SARS patients were reported [8] . Results from a recently completed trial of Lopinavir/Ritonavir in patients with severe COVID-19 generated disappointed outcomes and showed no significant antiviral effects [9] . Without effective antiviral drugs for COVID-19, health care workers have no alternative choices but mainly rely on the supportive and symptomatic treatments to manage COVID-19 patients. The rapid spread and daily increase of large death numbers in over 100countries perhaps represent one of the biggest medical and humanity challenges, it is even more critical than two months ago to find antiviral drugs with clinical evidence for COVID-19 patients [10, 11] .",

Detailed operation procedures were identical to the above description, except that the step orders were changed to allow the observation of the preventive effects of Novaferon. Briefly, blank Vero E6 cells were incubated with series concentrations of Novaferon for 2 hours, and the supernatants containing Novaferon were then removed. The pre-treated Vero E6 cells were exposed to SARS-CoV-2 by incubation with C-Tan-nCov Wuhan strain 01 (100PFU) for 2 hours, and the supernatants containing SARS-CoV-2 were then removed. Fresh medium was added, and the cells were incubated for 48 hours. 100 \u03bc L of supernatants were taken from each well, and the total viral RNA in the supernatants was measured using the same methods described above. The Ct number obtained from Vero E6 cells without pre-treatment of Novaferon was considered as 100%, and the decreased Ct numbers obtained from the pre-treated Vero E6 cells with various concentrations of Novaferon were used to calculate the inhibition percentages. The preventive effects of Novaferon were then determined by observing the viral RNA reduction inthe cells pre-treated with Novaferon. The EC 50 of Novaferon for the observed preventive effects was decided accordingly.",

For the secondary endpoint, time to SARS-CoV-2 clearance, median time for each group was estimated with the use of the Kaplan-Meier method and treatment differences were tested using log-rank test. All tests were two-sided, with a p value of less than 0.05 considered to indicate statistical significance. Analysis was conducted using SAS V9.2.",

A clinically-isolated strain of SARS-CoV-2 (C-Tan-nCov Wuhan strain 01) was propagated in Vero E6 cells before the experiments, and the plaque assay was used to quantify the titre (plaque forming unit, PFU) of the SARS-CoV-2. Blank Vero E6 cells in 96-well plates with a density of 1 x 10 4 per well were incubated with C-Tan-nCov Wuhan strain 01 (100PFU) for 2 hours to induce the infection of the cultured cells by SARS-CoV-2. After viruscontaining supernatants were removed and cells rinsed, medium with various concentrations of Novaferon(0, 0.001, 0.01, 0.1, 1,10, or 100ng/ml)was added and the cells were then incubated for 24 hours to allow the viral replication. After 24 hours, 100 \u03bc L of supernatants from each well were collected, and the total viral RNA was extracted (Full-automatic nucleic acid Extraction System from TIANLONG) and measured. Takara Bio's One Step Prime Script Real-time PCR (RT-PCR) Kit (Perfect Real Time) was used to detect the copies of the virus RNA. The Quantitative real-time PCR cycle threshold (Ct) was obtained, and the inhibition rates of virus replication by each Novaferon concentration were calculated.

The 3-day reduction of time to SARS-CoV-2 clearance in patients with Novaferon treatment further supported the antiviral effects of Novaferon.
