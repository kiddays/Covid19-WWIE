A comprehensive understanding of the direct physiologic effects of social stress on viral pathophysiology is needed. To determine the effect of social stress on HIV pathogenesis during acute viral infection without sociobehavioral confounders inherent in human cohorts, we compared commonly 25 measured parameters of HIV progression between singly and socially housed SIVinfected pigtailed macaques (Macaca nemestrina). Singly housed macaques demonstrated lower CD4/CD8 ratios, greater CD4 T cell declines and greater T cell activation compared to socially housed macaques during acute SIV infection. Singly housed macaques furthermore had higher viral loads in the plasma and cerebrospinal 30 fluid throughout acute infection. These data demonstrate that social stress directly impacts the pathogenesis of acute lentiviral infection and imply that social stress has a direct effect on the pathogenesis of HIV and potentially other viral infections.",

While data is currently unavailable for analysis in the COVID- 19 pandemic, other viral pandemics, such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), may 45 provide insight. HIV infection remains widespread and, while people with HIV (PWH) treated with antiretroviral therapy (ART) today live relatively normal lives compared to untreated individuals, outcomes for PWH vary greatly and depend upon a number of factors, including social stress. PWH are at higher risk for social stress due to stigma associated with infection and marginalization of people from demographics that are 50 considered at higher risk of infection (5) . Not surprisingly, PWH report decreased physical and mental well-being compared to the general population (6) , and worse mental and physical quality of life than individuals with other chronic illnesses (7).",

This effect is observed while all aspects of infection and care remained consistent between these groups (Table S1 ), effectively removing the sociobehavioral confounders that affect 135 access to care and adherence to treatment inherent in PWH. Thus, this study demonstrates that there is a direct pathophysiologic effect of social stress on pathogenesis of lentiviral infection and that social stress may have implications for pathogenesis of other viral infections, including SARS-CoV-2. This analysis has implications beyond primary infection for PWH. The CD4/CD8 140 ratio was lower and CD4 decline greater in singly housed compared to socially housed animals. Lower CD4/CD8 ratio is a predictor of non-AIDS related morbidity and mortality (10) and age-associated disease in PWH (12), while low CD4 counts are a direct prognostic indicator of disease progression throughout infection (13) . Our observation of these negative prognostic indicators in the context of social stress provides additional 145 evidence that social stress directly contributes to negative outcomes. Additionally, latent reservoirs are established during acute infection, remain the major barrier to cure, and are especially difficult to eliminate from sanctuary sites such as the brain (14, 15) . Our findings of higher viral loads in the plasma and CSF in the context of social stress have long-term implications for PWH. These higher viral loads may ultimately originate from 150 the increased CD4 activation that we observed in the singly housed animals, as activated CD4 T cells simultaneously serve as permissive cells for the virus to infect and produce more virus if infected, thus potentiating viral spread and reservoir seeding (16).",

Such changes to the immune system driven by social stress have the potential to introduce a confounder into infectious disease studies. Certain psychosocial variables such as social stability lead to an increased risk of mortality from SIV infection (37) . Our data complements the existing 210 literature by demonstrating differences in the immune response and viral loads in singly compared to socially housed SIV-infected macaques. Though we cannot directly demonstrate improvements in translation and reproducibility through this work, the magnitude of the decline in CD4 T cell counts that we observed in socially housed macaques during acute infection (two-fold) is more analogous to that seen in humans 215 during primary HIV infection (38) than the three-fold change observed in singly housed macaques. Further, the decrease in variability of the data generated by our socially housed macaques has implications for study reproducibility. Social housing of macaques is therefore an important refinement that may improve the translational value and reproducibility of data obtained from working with macaque models of HIV infection, 220 and caution must be taken when comparing the data from studies completed in singly and socially housed macaques.

We demonstrated that housing macaques individually directly affects CD4/CD8 ratios, CD4 T cell decline, T cell activation and SIV viral load during acute infection. Social stress thus directly influences disease progression in the SIV-infected macaque model of HIV and social stress is likely to have direct pathophysiologic impact on health outcomes of PWH and potentially on the pathogenesis of other viral 75 infections.",

In uninfected people, chronic stress dysregulates immune function (17), leading to a 160 suppression in antibody production (18), a suppression in leukocyte proliferation(19), and a reduction in virus-specific T cell and NK cell activity (20). Social isolation is associated with under-expression of proinflammatory genes, including those involved in innate antiviral resistance through type I interferon responses(25,31), and could directly affect immune response and viral control. Compounding these effects, PWH 165 have increased levels of plasma cortisol compared to uninfected controls, and inflammatory cytokine interleukin-1 (IL-1) and HIV gp120 are implicated in mediating this increased level of cortisol by increasing levels of corticotropin-releasing hormone.Clinical studies demonstrate that glucocorticoid receptors of PWH have decreased affinity for cortisol, resulting in glucocorticoid insufficiency despite increased circulating 170 cortisol. Viral suppression with ART does not fully attenuate the dysfunction in the physiologic stress response in PWH, illustrating the complexity of the interaction between HIV and the stress response (reviewed in (21). Interestingly, social support mitigates the immunosuppressive impact of glucocorticoid release in uninfected individuals (22). However, the findings from studies on the effect of social support on 175",

Macaque models are instrumental in achieving scientific advancement for treatment of PWH and continue to be at the forefront of discovery in HIV and in other viral pathogenesis research (9, 25-32). However, an animal model's value is only as great as the translational value of its data, and how we 195 keep animals in research settings can impact translational value and the reproducibility of generated data (33). Specifically, excessive physiologic stress as a result of housing conditions such as single housing has the potential to reduce the translational value of animal models. Single housing of mouse and rat models of epilepsy led to an increase in corticosterone and adrenocorticotropic hormone levels, a decrease in brain-",

            "text": ", we demonstrate that social stress in the form of single housing of macaques has a direct negative impact on the pathogenesis of acute SIV infection, leading to lower CD4/CD8 ratios, more pronounced decline in circulating CD4 T cells, 225 increase in T cell activation, and elevated peripheral and CNS viral loads. These data indicate that social support for PWH can have a direct positive impact on disease progression beyond the positive psychobehavioral effects and practical benefits, and provides evidence supporting a direct pathophysiologic effect of this social support on outcomes for PWH. Further research is needed into the implications of social isolation 230 on the pathogenesis of other viral infections. In particular, the findings of our study have high relevance for the potential impact of social isolation practices widely advocated during the current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. These data should furthermore be considered as evidence for the direct effect that social housing has on this vital animalmodel of HIV infection, as refinements such as social housing have the potential to 235 improve the reproducibility and translational value of biomedical research conducted with animal models.
