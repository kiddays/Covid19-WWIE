In 3 out of 11 patients, the pulmonary abnormalities started with GGO, progressed to crazy paving pattern with superimposed inter-and intralobular septal thickening, in 9 out of 11 patients, the GGO with crazy paving pattern evolved to consolidation with linear densities or reticulation. The predominant findings in different phases for each patient was presented in Table 2 . Of the 11 patients, 10 (90.91%) had GGO with crazy paving sign, which was more frequent in the first 15 days while 8 (72.7) had consolidations or linear densities, which was more frequent in the second half of the month.

We observed an evolution pattern of predominant findings with GGO to GGO with superimposed inter-and intralobular septal thickening in 3 patients (crazy paving pattern), then to consolidation with linear densities, or to reticulation in 9 patients ( Figure. 3). Lung cysts, traction bronchiectasis could be seen from day 7 from onset of symptoms and reticulation, subpleural curvilinear lines were more common from day 20 (Figure 4 and Figure.5 ). In addition to the peripheral lung distribution of the pulmonary opacities, which was similar to a recently published study [14] , in our cohort anterior-posterior density gradient and relative sparing of the non-dependent lung were also seen in the first 15 days (Figure 4 ). It has been reported that the anterior-posterior density gradient is typical in the early phase of ARDS, due to the posterior compressive atelectasis caused by the weight of the overlying parenchyma [15, 16] . The lung cysts were reported to be features of the later stages of ARDS, which may be caused by prolonged ventilation or secondary to pneumonia. Unlike those patients in previous imaging studies [14, 17] , more than half of the patients in our study had pleural effusion. Compared to the lung involvement score in another study using the same qualitative scale of COVID-19 [18] with the average score range 2 to 7, the severity of lung involvement in our study was high with an average score of 9.7 in the first phase, 18 in the second phase plateauing in the next two phases, with a slight decrease in the average score to 16.9 in the late phase indicating a little bit of resolution. It is evident that the severe lung injury started early and persisted in extent and severity beyond 20 days from the onset of symptoms.",

In our study, pulmonary embolism was documented in 11 (46%) of 24 patients with higher Ddimer and suspected of PE, which is much higher than expected frequency for this patient population. Two out of 11 patients had lower-limb ultrasonography performed and no lower extremity deep vein thrombosis was found. Acute infection was reported to be a strong trigger for venous thromboembolism independent of concomitant immobilization [20] , and there was higher risk estimates for infection preceding pulmonary embolism (PE) than deep vein thrombosis, and respiratory tract infection had a greater impact on venous thromboembolism than non-respiratory infections [21] . In our study, all the patient developed pulmonary embolism after severe COVID-19 pneumonia without major risk factors for PE including underlying cardiopulmonary diseases, oncologic disease history, past deep vein thrombosis, or prolonged immobility more than 3 days, which may further confirm the role of infection as an independent trigger for thromboembolism. It was also reported that vascular hyaline thrombi was found in alveolar interstitium based on the limited autopsy cases of COVID-19 in China [22] . The pulmonary emboli in our case series were most commonly observed in segmental and subsegmental pulmonary arteries, and there were four patients with PE in subsegmental arteries only. In the segmental and subsegmental pulmonary arteries, the emboli were scattered and sometimes presented as minor filling defects ( Figure. 6 ), which may be caused by the microthrombi .

In the critically ill patients, 67% of patients developed ARDS, which was the most common complication. And in critically ill patients with ARDS, 61.5% died within 28 days [24] . All patients in this study developed ARDS, suggesting a correlation between ARDS and PE. This may be explained by the proposed mechanism of thromboinflammation causing ARDS, which is inflammation that activates platelets and causes damage to the endothelium, resulting in fibrin deposition and thrombus formation [25] . In a mouse models of ARDS, infection with the influenza virus increases platelet aggregation, pulmonary microvascular thrombosis, endothelial damage and the hyper-inflammatory cytokine responses [26, 27, 28] . Dysregulation of these same physiologic responses have been associated with pulmonary embolism (PE) [29] , and prior studies have described PE in the setting of influenza infection [2, 3] .",

However, the population from which these patients were selected represents approximately 1.5% of all COVID-19 patients reported worldwide. A larger data set could be achieved with a multicenter study or in the future as more patients present. A second limitation is that the CT scans in different time phases were not equally represented. For example, there were fewer CT scans performed in the first 10 days after onset of symptoms compared other time periods. A third limitation is that only 4 out of 11 patients were RT PCR test positive. Although a positive RT-PCR test is not required for diagnosis based on current guidelines in Hubei province, the test is considered highly specific, increasing confidence in the diagnosis. COVID-19 virus load is higher in early days after infection [30] , and the limited number of the RT-PCR kits available delayed testing for many the patients, causing the test to be performed when it is less accurate. Patient with negative RT-PCR would be retested in 3 days, but 3 of the patients died before this was possible, also suggesting they presented at a later stage of infection. RT-PCR is not required for diagnosis and this is supported by multiple studies. For example, on study showed that 60% to 93% of patients with an initial positive chest CT consistent with COVID-19 had negative RT-PCR results [31]. In another case series, the sensitivity of CT for COVID-19 diagnosis was 98% compared to RT-PCR sensitivity of 71% within 3 days from onset of symptoms [32]. Although 7 of the patients in this study had negative RT-PCR results, they were still probable COVID-19 according to WHO's interim guidance and clinically confirmed COVID-19 according to the Chinese Guideline of Diagnosis and Treatment for COVID-19, which was only applicable in Hubei Province due to the insufficient sensitivity of RT-PCR testing in the epidemic center [10] .",

All patients in our study developed ARDS, suggesting PE may occur with increased frequency in the ARDS subgroup. This high incidence of PE in COVID-19 patients has not been reported previously. The evolution of pulmonary imaging findings shares some common characteristics with non-severe COVID-19 patients, but are also unique in that there is more extensive lung injury, and a longer time for the abnormalities to resolve. Given that all patients with PE developed ARDS, there should be a lower threshold for suspecting PE in COVID-19 patients with ARDS. This may facilitate better detection of PE and reduce mortality and morbidity in COVID-19 patients.",
