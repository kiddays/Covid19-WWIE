We modelled per-patient delay of three months and six months and periods of disruption of one year and two years. Using healthcare resource costing, we contextualise attributable lives saved and life years gained from cancer surgery to equivalent volumes of COVID-19 hospitalisations. Findings: Per year, 94,912 resections for major cancers result in 80,406 long-term survivors and 1,717,051 life years gained. Per-patient delay of six months would cause attributable death of 10,555 of these individuals with loss of 205,024 life years. For cancer surgery, average life years gained (LYGs) per patient are 18\u00b71 under standard conditions and 15\u00b79 with a delay of six months (a loss of 2\u00b73 LYG per patient). Taking into account units of healthcare resource (HCRU), surgery results on average per patient in 2\u00b725 resource-adjusted life years gained (RALYGs) under standard conditions and 1\u00b798 RALYGs following delay of six months. For 94,912 hospital COVID-19 admissions, there are 474,505 LYGs requiring of 1,097,937 HCRUs. Hospitalisation of community-acquired COVID-19 patients yields on average per patient 5\u00b70 LYG and 0\u00b743 RALYGs. Interpretation: Delay of six months in surgery for incident cancers would mitigate 43% of life years gained by hospitalisation of an equivalent volume of admissions for community acquired COVID-19. This rises to 62% when considering resource-adjusted life-years gained.",

Specifically, we have examined the impact on cancer outcomes of different periods of delay of cancer surgery with disruption extending over variable time periods, comparing resource-weighted outcomes to hospital management of COVID-19 patients. We provide the research, policy community and public with: (i) baseline parameters (surgical case volume, 5-year survival, surgical intervention, resource requirement, pattern of adjuvant chemotherapy) to assist further modelling of cancer services; (ii) an evidence-based model of per-day cancer progression for different tumour types; (iii) initial estimates of attributable deaths and lost actuarial life years for each age-specific, stage-specific group of cancer patients, by per-patient delay and period of disruption; (iv) initial estimates of attributable deaths and lost actuarial life years summed at population-level; (v) using .

By accounting for COVID-related post-surgical mortality and changes in SACT, we adjusted five-year survival figures for each cancer for surgical patients under standard care to estimate current 5-year survival. To model outcomes of surgery post-delay, we apply to standard 5-year survival, the transition HR for the specified number of days of delay, again including COVID-related post-surgical mortality and changes in SACT.

Predicated on this assertion, we considered gain in actuarial life years gained adjusting for resource, resource adjusted life years (RALYGs). Perhaps not surprisingly, most benefit is afforded in younger age groups for operations that are shorter with no associated ICU requirement. For example, trans urethral resection of stage 1 bladder cancers affords on average 23\u00b74 RALYG per patient age 30-39, whereas cystectomy for stage 2 bladder cancer is only associated with 1\u00b72 RALYGs in that age group (Supplementary Table 3 ).

However, presuming as incorrect the assumption that COVID-related disruption to services will be fully resolved within 12 weeks, nearly all non-emergency cancer cases will by this schema be in the urgent category. Some professional groups have issued more specific tumour-type guidance. Given an accrued backlog of cases and ongoing tight competition for resources, it is inevitable that decisions regarding surgical prioritisation will be required for a number of years, with capacity varying geographically and temporally. Recognising its limitations regarding assumptions and parameters, we propose a model that provides a rational approach by which to evaluate across patients of different ages, tumour types and stages, the benefit and resource implications of their cancer surgery.

Evaluation is also important for the alternative management approaches being adopted, such as radiotherapy with curative intent where surgery is gold-standard or a priori hormonal treatment for prostate and ER-positive breast cancers. For any strategies involving deliberate delay to surgery, models for re-staging and dynamic re-prioritisation are essential.

These estimates are inherently conservative as they do not take into account the impact on life expectancy of the excess comorbidities associated with many hospitalised COVID-19 cases.

We present data for per-patient delays of 3 and six months, and periods of disruption of 1 year and 2 years, but provide a flexible model by which the reader can explore other scenarios (Supplementary Materials). We explore the impact on available life years by modelling 5-year survival to approximate long-term survival and resumption of actuarial life expectancy. To contextualise the impact of delay to cancer surgery against current strains on resource, we compare equivalent admission volumes for cancer surgery and COVID-19 care, examining life years gained against resource required.

While we have made use of observational data, our approach simplifies the complexity of cancer progression and is solely survival-focused. For healthcare planning, a more elaborate model capturing stage-shifting may offer additional utility. The benefit of SACT is simplistic as the dosing, benefits and immunosuppressive consequences vary by chemotherapy regimen. Mortality from nosocomial COVID-19 infection during surgical admission or attendance for chemotherapy is based on a uniform per-day risk of infection: these may vary between institutions. Our model of COVID-19 admissions is limited by availability of detailed individual-level UK data, in particular for non-CCU hospital admissions, thus necessitating reliance on data from China and Italy. While our resourcing analysis deliberately focuses on the requirement for the direct medical and nursing staff who most limit healthcare provision, we acknowledge it does not capture other 'costs' incurred in hospital care, primary care and social care.",
