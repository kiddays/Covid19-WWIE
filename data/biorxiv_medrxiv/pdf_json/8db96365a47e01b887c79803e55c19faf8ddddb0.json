We estimate that the peak of the first wave of the epidemic in Algeria will be reached with herd immunity of 15.93% as of November 2020, however, at least 56% of people with protective immunity would be needed to be sufficient to avoid a second wave. The used method to carry out the evaluation has given us a good overview, but, R0 is not the only factor to consider when estimating the burden of the epidemic, to do that, the number of daily admissions to intensive care units and hospitalizations remain good indicators.",

To avoid this, the preventive strategy can adopt a situation-updated plan, so that, the implementation of total containment can move to other cities or throughout the country in the coming weeks depending of epidemic's displacement.",

Furthermore, R0 is not the only factor to consider when estimating the burden of the epidemic and it is not necessarily the best indicator of the magnitude of the COVID-19 epidemic as it depends as mentioned above on the rate of symptomatic and asymptomatic cases and on testing capabilities. The most reliable parameters to assess the epidemic evolution remain first, the number of daily admissions to intensive care units, and secondly the emergency room admissions, and thirdly the number of hospitalizations. The observation of the daily number of deaths by COVID-19 is also good indicator if we take into account other bias such as age structure, quality of health service delivery and medical history of cases over time and places.",
