The NEWS2 is a summary score of six physiological parameters or 'vital signs' (respiratory rate, oxygen saturation, systolic blood pressure, heart rate, level of consciousness, temperature and supplemental oxygen dependency), used to identify patients at risk of early clinical deterioration in the UK NHS hospitals 6, 7 . The physiological parameters assessed in the NEWS2 score -particularly patient temperature, oxygen saturations and the supplemental oxygen dependency -have been associated with COVID-19 outcomes 1 ; however, little is known about their predictive value for the severity of COVID-19 disease. Additionally, a number of COVID-19-specific risk indices are being developed [8] [9] [10] as well as unvalidated online calculators 11 but generalisability is not yet known 10 . A Chinese study has suggested a modified version of NEWS2 with addition of age only 12 but without any data on performance. With near universal usage of NEWS2 in UK NHS Trusts since March 2019 13 , minor adaptation to NEWS2 would be relatively easy to implement.",

Parameters exhibiting skewed distributions were transformed before modelling with logarithmic or square-root transformations. All parameters were scaled (mean = 0, standard deviation = 1) to improve interpretability. Outlying high values for some blood parameters were retained after individual examination by clinicians who ascertained their plausibility. We used the maximal available sample when testing each parameter. Given the number of tests conducted, P -values were adjusted using the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure to keep the False discovery rate at 5% 28 .

The optimal degree of regularization was determined by identifying a tuning parameter \u03bb using cross-validation 30 . LASSO regression provides a sparse, interpretable model, which allows us to predict individual risk scores (i.e. probability of severe outcome). Starting from an initial model with NEWS2 total score only, sets of features were added in order of (i) age and sex, (ii) blood and physiological parameters; (iii) comorbid conditions. A final model was estimated using NEWS2 total score alongside the top five most influential features from previous models. To estimate the predictive performance of our model on new unseen cases of the same underlying population, we performed internal nested cross-validation (10 folds and 20 repeats for the inner loop; 10 folds and 100 repeats for the outer loop). Overall discrimination was assessed based on the area under the curve (AUC). All continuous features were scaled (mean = 0, standard deviation = 1). Missing feature information was imputed (after scaling) using k-Nearest Neighbours imputation (k=5).Scaling and kNN imputation were incorporated within the model development and selection process to avoid data leakage which would otherwise result in optimistic performance measures 31 .",

Internally validated predictive performance based on the area under the ROC curve (AUC) is presented in Table 3 for different feature sets. NEWS2 shows poor discrimination with an AUC of 0.628. Adding age and sex to a baseline model of NEWS2 total score only increased the AUC by 0.025 to 0.653 (+/-2SD range: 0.639, 0.667). Further adding in all other blood and physiological parameters (except NEWS2) increased the AUC further by 0.089, to 0.742 (+/-2SD: 0.726, 0.758). Additionally including comorbidities in this model did not improve performance. A final model was estimated including NEWS2 and the top five most important features taken from Model 4. This simpler model resulted in a slightly larger AUC of 0.751 (+/-2SD range: 0.737, 0.764) which may indicate some overfitting due to the pre-selection of variables from previous analyses. Results were consistent when repeating these models in the subset of patients with information available on ethnicity (Supplementary Table 5 ). Figure 1 summarises feature importances from the LASSO logistic regression models. When adding blood and physiological parameters to NEWS2 ('NEWS2 + DBP'), 8 features were retained, in order of effect sizes: NEWS2 total score, CRP, neutrophils, estimated GFR, albumin, age, Troponin T, and oxygen saturation. Notably, when additionally considering comorbid conditions ('NEWS2 + DBPC'), the retained features were similar, and no comorbid conditions were retained. This suggests that most of the variance is already captured by the top 5 parameters.",

We found that the NEWS2 score shows overall poor discrimination with high specificity but poor sensitivity for severe outcomes in COVID-19 infection (transfer to ICU or death). However, its value for risk stratification (especially sensitivity) can be significantly improved by adding age and a small number of additional blood parameters (CRP, neutrophils, estimated GFR and albumin). A number of blood measures previously linked with more severe outcomes -such as lymphocyte and ALT 14 , or transformations of inflammatory markers such as CRP/lymphocyte or neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio -did not provide additional value to the model over and above the existing features despite being more common in those individuals with more severe outcomes. Moreover, cardiac disease and myocardial injury has been described to be commonly seen in the severe COVID-19 cases in China 1,21 . In our model, blood Troponin-T, a marker of myocardial injury, had additional salient signal but was only measured in a subset of our cohort at admission, so it was not included in our final model. This would have to be explored further in larger datasets. A systematic review of 10 prediction models for mortality in COVID-19 infection 10 found broad similarities with the features retained in our models, particularly regarding CRP and neutrophil levels. However, existing prediction models suffer several methodological weaknesses including over-fitting, selection bias, and reliance on cross-sectional data without accounting for censoring. Additionally, almost all existing studies have relied on ethnically homogenous Chinese cohorts and thus may be unrepresentative of other global populations.",

However, some limitations should be acknowledged. First, there are likely to be other parameters not measured in this study that could improve the risk stratification model substantially (e.g. radiological features, other comorbidities or comorbidity load). This could be addressed by future work to introduce additional data modalities, but these were not considered in the present study to avoid limiting the real-world implementation of the risk stratification model; a complex model with many parameters will be harder to implement in clinical practice. Second, we used a 14-day time window from the symptom onset date as this provides a balance between medium-term prognostication and actionable risk stratification at the usual period of deterioration. Longer timeframes may be useful for prognostication but are harder to generalise due to the greater number of factors affecting outcomes, including institutional, regional or national policies. Since NEWS2 score is optimised for very near-term deterioration at 24 hours 7 , a 14-day window was used as a compromise. Third, while the hold-out sample used for temporal external validation was similar in terms of demographics, blood and physiological parameters, the rate of more severe outcomes differed significantly. Perhaps due to changes in hospital procedures over time, this again suggests the need to validate these models in other hospitals or regions. Finally, while the model was derived from two hospital sites providing a mixed population, this study highlights that initial prediction models still have poor sensitivity and recalibration would be required before implementation as a risk model in clinical practice. Validation across datasets from a wider geographical region will be necessary to ensure generalisability.",

The additional parameters are widely collected on patients at hospital admission, and with near universal usage of NEWS2 in NHS Trusts since March 2019 13 , a minor adaptation to NEWS2 is substantially easier to implement in a variety of health settings than a bespoke risk score.",

            "text": "). The catchment area of King's College Hospital NHS Foundation Trust includes the most severely affected part of the UK during the current pandemic. All patients included in the study had symptoms consistent with COVID-19 disease (e.g. cough, fever, dyspnoea, myalgia, delirium). We excluded subjects who were seen in the emergency department but not admitted. For purposes of temporal external validation, detailed below, patients were split into training and temporal external validation samples, with those tested positive before 31 st March 2020 assigned to training, and those tested positive on/after 31 st March 2020 assigned to validation.The data (demographics, emergency department letters, discharge summaries, clinical notes, lab results, vital signs) were retrieved and analyzed in near real-time from the structured and unstructured components of the electronic health record (EHR) using a variety of natural language processing (NLP) informatics tools belonging to the CogStack ecosystem22 , namely MedCAT 23 and MedCATTrainer 24 . The CogStack NLP pipeline captures negation, synonyms, and acronyms for medical SNOMED-CT concepts as well as surrounding linguistic context using deep learning and long short-term memory networks. MedCAT produces unsupervised annotations for all SNOMED-CT concepts under parent terms Clinical Finding, Disorder, Organism, and Event with disambiguation, pre-trained on MIMIC-III25 . The annotated SNOMED-CT terms are summarised inSupplementary Table 1.Starting from our previous model26 , further supervised training improved detection of annotations and meta-annotations such as experiencer (is the concept annotated experienced by the patient or other), negation (is the concept annotated negated or not) and temporality (is the concept annotated in the past or present) with MedCATTrainer. Meta-annotations for hypothetical, historical and experiencer were merged into \"Irrelevant\" allowing us to exclude any mentions of a concept that do not directly relate to the patient currently. Performance of the MedCAT NLP pipeline for disorders mentioned in the text was evaluated on 4343 annotations in 146 clinical documents by a clinician (JT). F1 scores, precision, and recall are presented in SupplementaryTable 2.",
