We sampled and tested rodents (851) and other mammals, and found Betacoronavirus RNA in 12 rodents. The sequences belong to two separate genetic clusters, and relate closely to known rodent coronaviruses detected in the region, and distantly to human coronaviruses OC43 and HKU1. Considering close human-wildlife contact with many species in and beyond the region, a better understanding of virus diversity is urgently needed for the mitigation of future risks.",

The suspected index case contracted the virus at a local seafood and wildlife market in the city, yet the exact species of animal that hosted the virus remains unknown. Phylogenetic analysis of the SARS-CoV-2 genome indicates a strong likelihood that the reservoir species is a bat, as in the case of the related Betacoronaviruses SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV [2] . An involvement of another intermediate host between bats and humans in the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 virus remains unknown. Wildlife and bushmeat markets are common across Southeast Asia, and represent a significant risk for the transfer of zoonotic pathogens between wildlife and humans. Indeed, 75% of all emerging infectious diseases in the past decades have their origin in wildlife, including highly pathogenic influenza viruses (H5N1), Ebolaviruses, Henipaviruses, Hantaviruses among others [3] .",

The value chain involves a series of intermediaries that transit animals from small villages to progressively larger populated areas. At the market, animals are sold to locals or to Lao people visiting from other areas of the country, and often to foreign visitors from neighbouring Thailand, China, and Vietnam [8, 9] . Even though the sales of these animals are illegal, Laos attracts many wildlife trade tourists simply because wildlife products are more available. Throughout this value chain, people are exposed to blood, viscera, feces, and saliva of rodents, and can be further exposed to these materials during the butchering process, where butchers can accidentally cut themselves with knives, allowing for efficient transmission of viruses from rodents to humans [9] . Considering the significant interactions of wildlife and especially rodents with humans in Laos, we were interested in investigating the presence of CoVs in these animals, which can be primary or intermediate as forward primers, while the reverse primer was again CoV-RVS3 [11] . Both versions amplify 387nt between the primer binding sites. CoV RNA positive samples were subjected to Cytochrome b PCR to verify the host species. The primers CytB_F (GAG GMC AAA TAT CAT TCT GAG G) and CytB_R (TAG GGC VAG GAC TCC TCC TAG T) were used to amplify a primerflanked 435nt fragment of the highly conserved mitochondrial gene [12] .",

The 1.4% prevalence of CoV RNA in rodents was much lower than what had been detected in bats in Laos, however such has been observed repeatedly, re-emphasizing the role of bats as a primary CoV source [5, 15, [16] [17] [18] .

We employed swab sampling to minimize harm to live animals, and to avoid any damage to rodents possessed by hunters or market vendors during sampling. Organ collection was rarely feasible, even from dead rodents in market settings, since size and mass of the animal are used to determine the selling price.

The rodent coronaviruses do fall into the same cluster as human coronaviruses OC43 and HKU1 though, which are believed to be derived from a direct or indirect spill-over of rodent viruses to humans [21] . However, we still do not know enough about the molecular mechanisms and drivers of zoonotic events to determine risk or lack of risk with certainty. We conclude that Laos' wildlife does harbor diverse CoVs, and that a potential for interspecies transmission of viruses and novel diseases exists. Human contact with wildlife like bats and rodents is common throughout the country, with many rural households consuming bushmeat as a main source of protein and utilizing it as a trade commodity, this risk potential is particularly relevant. Therefore, behavioral risk reduction, vigilance, ongoing surveillance and research are important to help ",

With permission of market operators and vendors, samples were also collected from freshly killed animals for sale in markets. Oral and rectal swab specimens were collected in duplicate into individual 1.5 mL screw-top cryotubes containing either 500 \u00b5l of Trizol\u00ae (Invitrogen), or of Universal Viral Transport Medium (BD) respectively. Samples were then directly liquid nitrogen dry shippers and upon arrival at the laboratory transferred into a -80\u00b0C freezer. Staff wore N95 masks, nitrile gloves, dedicated clothing, washable shoes or shoe covers, and protective eyewear during both live and dead animal sampling.RNA was extracted using the Zymo Direct-zol RNA kit and stored at -80\u00baC until analysis. RNAwas converted into cDNA using a Maxima H Minus First Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit (Thermo Scientific) and was stored at -20\u00b0C until analysis. Two conventional nested broad range PCR assays, both targeting conserved regions in the RNA-Dependent RNA Polymerase gene (RdRp) were used to test the samples for CoV cDNA. The first PCR amplifies a product of approximately 286nt between the primer binding sites. The first round (CoV-FWD1: CGT TGG IAC WAA YBT VCC WYT ICA RBT RGG and CoV-RVS1: GGT CAT KAT AGC RTC AVM ASW WGC NAC ATG) and second round (CoV-FWD2: GGC WCC WCC HGG NGA RCA ATT and CoV-RVS2: GGW AWC CCC AYT GYT GWA YRT C) primers of this PCR were specifically designed for the detection of a broad range of CoVs [10]. The second PCR was used in two modified versions, one of them specifically targeting a broad range of CoVs in bats the second one broadly targeting CoVs of other hosts. In both cases, the first round of the semi nested PCR utilized the primers CoV-FWD3 (GGT TGG GAY TAY CCH AAR TGT GA) and CoV-RVS3 (CCA TCA TCA SWY RAA TCA TCA TA) for the first round. In the second round either CoV-FWD4/Bat (GAY TAY CCH AAR TGT GAY AGA GC) or CoV-FWD4/Other (GAY TAY CCH AAR TGT GAU MGW GC) were used",

Only a single sequence was included for isolates with nucleotide identities of more than 95%. Multiple sequence alignments were made in Geneious (version 11.1.3, MUSCLE Alignment), and regions supported by less than 50% of the sequences were excluded.Bayesian phylogeny of the polymerase gene fragment was inferred using MrBayes (version 3.2) with the following parameters: Datatype=DNA, Nucmodel=4by4, Nst=1, Coavion=No, # States=4, Rates=Equal, 2 runs, 4 chains of 1,000,000 generations. The sequence of a whale Gammacoronavirus served as outgroup to root the trees, and trees were sampled after every 1,000 steps during the process to monitor phylogenetic convergence[13]. The average standard deviation of split frequencies was below 0.0074 for the Watanabe PCR based analysis and below 0.0054 for the Quan PCR based analysis (MrBayes recommended final average <0.01). The first 10% of the trees were discarded and the remaining ones combined using TreeAnnotator (version 2.5.1; http://beast.bio.ed.ac.uk) and displayed with FIGTREE (1.4.4; http://tree.bio.ed.ac.uk/)[14].During the sampling phases of the project (2010-2013 and 2016-2018) 851 rodents, 124 carnivores, 44 primates, 8 tree shrews and one colugo (Galeopterus variegatus) were sampled and tested for the presence of CoV RNA (Figure 1). Rodents belonged to the families Sciuridae (475), Muridae (370), Diatomyidae (5), and Hystricidae (1); carnivores belonged to the families Viverridae (121), Mustelidae (2), and Felidae (1); primates belonged to the families Cercopithecidae (23), Lorisidae (18), and Hylobatidae (2), while one remained unidentified, and all tree shrews were of the Tupaiidae family (8) (Supplement 1).",
