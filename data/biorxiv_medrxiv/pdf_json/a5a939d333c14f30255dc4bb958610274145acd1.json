Iran has been among the first few countries that has been affected severely, after China, which forced the government to put some restriction and enforce social distancing in majority of the country. In less than 2 months, Iran has more than 80,000 confirmed cases, and more than 5,000 death. Based on the official statistics from Iran's government, the number of daily cases has started to go down recently, but many people believe if the lockdown is lifted without proper social distancing enforcement, there is a possibility for a second wave of COVID-19 cases. In this work, we analyze at the data for the number cases in Iran in the past few weeks, and train a predictive model to estimate the possible future trends for the number of cases in Iran, depending on the government policy in the coming weeks and months. Our analysis may help political leaders and health officials to take proper action toward handling COVID-19 in the coming months.",

This early prediction using mathematical models and combining with a small amount of existing data would effectively help the governments and public health officials to put in place appropriate prevention and control strategies. For answering this issue many mathematical models are already used for prediction ILI pandemics. Two approaches are generally considered in the literature on forecasting ILI pandemics. The first is focused on short-term estimation, and the others try to predict a long-term estimation. Based on some prominent studies in this filed [8, 9] , deep learning methods conquered other classical models in short-term estimation of pandemics. In special case of COVID-19, given the novelty of the subject, most studies have already focused on short-term prediction; however, to the best of our knowledge, no work is already published on prediction of occurrence of COVID-19 using deep learning models. Limited number of works have already used deep learning in diagnosis of COVID-19 using medical images [10] .",

The COVID-19 Data (by John Hopkins university) contains daily number of confirmed/ death / recovered people. The Basic information contains the information about date/country/province of the cases. The More details on how the data is used, is as follows. We collected the COVID-19 data from John Hopkins University [19] and [20] . The dataset contains cumulative number of confirmed, death and recovered COVID-19 cases in various locations across the world for different dates. Basic information (Date, Country, Province) were also provided by John Hopkins University. We also added more detailed information for each country; this includes Region, Population, Area, etc. Detailed information for each country is according to information in [21] . Different combinations of the involved data are evaluated on proposed models and \"the most effective combination\" and \"optimal lag parameter\" are selected based of effectiveness in data modeling (section 5). In this work, we propose to show the performance of different deep learning (DL) and machine learning (ML) models for COVID-19 data prediction for above mentioned dataset. To have a successful prediction using deep learning based models, it is essential to have a large-scale dataset. However, since COVID-19 is a recent disease in the world, the available of data is limited and training a deep learning model from scratch on this dataset becomes very challenging. Therefore, with respect to intrinsic similarities of COVID-19 to pandemics like SARS , we also use a public dataset: [22] from November 2002 to July 2003 on SARS data. We first train the model with largescale data for SARS; the weights of the trained model are then used as pre-trained network and transfer learning is then utilized by training the weights of the last fully connected layers using COVID-19 dataset.",

Iran, Italy, Spain, and USA are selected due to the report of high number of confirmed and death cases. Germany and Switzerland are also coming from different trend with high number of confirmed cases and controlled number of death. Finally, Korea and Japan are also included for demonstrating the countries with high degree of control on the epidemic. Table 2 shows a summary of the performance on nine selected countries with different models and diverse combination of input features. With respect to results of Table 2 , we found a new set of parameters including basic and detailed feature plus lag (previous occurrences). Furthermore, the results suggest that M-LSTM is the best performing network for identifying the true magnitude of the pandemic with a MAPE value of 0.81% for nine selected countries. This network, as elaborated in section 4, uses lag information from confirmed, death, and recovered cases to predict each next occurrence. This result shows that considering the mutual effect of these three occurrences can provide a better modeling and ignoring such dependence, leads to less performance. Table 2 also shows that lowest performance is obtained with RF. Figure 8 compares the ability of best and worst performing models in correct prediction of the test values. All rights reserved.

Being aware of real time behavior of epidemics is vital for efficient logistics in the outbreak response.

Using this model we aimed to identify 1) the intensity of the epidemic peak, 2) the timing of the peak, and 3) the total number of cases expected over the duration of the epidemic of COVID-19 in Iran. Determining these outcomes could improve the allocation of resources for risk communication, primary prevention, secondary prevention and preparedness plans (e.g., planning medical staffs, preparing triage units, etc.). In this model we have used the best combination of inputs including lag, basic and detailed information features. In order to have a realistic prediction, three parameters of number of infected cases, number of deaths and number of recovered cases were used together to better shape the epidemic curve. Our simulation model is trained based on publicly available data from all countries of the world and also official reports of the Iranian Ministry of Health and Medical Education from 22 January, 2020 till 2 April 2020.",

The basic assumption of the models is stability of the environment measurements but as we do not live in controlled conditions, every decision would change the epidemic track. The effect of governmental decisions and public occasions is illustrated in figure 10 . Considering that it takes around 5-6 days (the median of incubation period) for the results of interventions to show up on new case numbers, the difference between blue and green line in between March 11th and 25th is the result of decisions on school and university closure and cancellation of cultural and religious events. Also the difference between red and green line between March 23rd and April 2nd is because of New Year holiday and travels. It means that by focusing on social distancing there would be a steady decline in new cases after April 2nd as shown by green line but changes in public health policies may change the epidemic track and postpone the end point as well.",
