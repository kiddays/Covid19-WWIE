These models are tools for designing and evaluating the effectiveness of control strategies (20) . The mathematical models used in this paper is based on an Exponential Logistic Growth and Susceptible Infectious Recovered (SIR) model, which is a standard compartmental model in epidemiology (21) (22) (23) (24) (25) . Previously, this model was used to make daily predictions and to estimate the approximate final size of the coronavirus epidemic (22, 26, 27) . The model is based on the previous data from the population of interest. Thus, our prediction is based on the data of reported infected and death cases for each country (26, 28, 29) . Indeed, the purpose of this study was to analysis the preventative measures implemented by Saudi Arabia and the UK and how these measures affect the reported and predicted cases of COVID-19.",

The model is datadriven, thus, the predictions were based on the variation in the data (26, 28, 29) . The method is not suitable if the epidemic is still in the early stage. Also, results are not significant if the regression statistic does not meet minimum criteria, say \" if R 2 > 0.8, p-value < 0.05\" (26, 28, 29) . The algorithm is available online on the MathWorks website and runs on MATLAB program software (29) . It was created by Milan Batista to track the spread of Coronavirus (COVID-19) (26, 28) .

More specifically, when the real number of cases is slightly larger than the number predicted by our model or it exceeded the predicted end-stage systematically. Another drawback is that the phase of the epidemic is not described by the SIR model; thus the model cannot be extrapolated unless the same arbitrary format is used (26, 28, 34) . Generally, the prediction model for new cases for both Saudi Arabia and the UK was not robust enough as it only explained 25% in Saudi Arabia, and 21% in the UK. Both models were generated for 31 days from the beginning to 1 st of April 2020. The model did not account for confounders such as age and gender fractions, governmental measures, and cities locked down. However, it assumes a uniform mixing of the population, where recovery is equally likely among the infected population (48) . The pattern of recovery and mortality rates in Saudi Arabia as well as in UK were not estimated due to incomplete data. Importantly, comparing infected cases in Saudi Arabia to the UK demonstrated a dramatic increase in UK. Similarly, the number of deaths in Saudi Arabia are less than the number of deaths in the UK. That may be due to the UK's higher population and population density compared to Saudi. However, the death per 1000 individual in Saudi is still significantly lower when controlled for population size (UK = 4.6x10 -4 ; Saudi = 3.5x10 -2 ). Thus, this difference might be related to the different governmental approaches taken at the time.",

Early before the first case was reported on the 2 nd March 2020, Saudi Arabia demonstrated high preparedness by undertaking exceptional precautionary measures.The Saudi government promoted a policy of \"We are all responsible\" to the public, encouraging and enforcing compliance with the guidelines provided by the authorities to counter the spread of COVID-19(6,12, 13).On the part of Saudi Arabia, pre-emptive measures were put in place, which prioritize the safety of the citizen with a full understanding of the social, religious and financial implications. Twodays after the declaration by WHO of a global emergency, Saudi Arabia suspended all travels to and from Guangzhou, China. This was swiftly followed by an array of measures including the suspension of travels for citizens and residents of China, temporary suspension of the holy hajj and Umrah pilgrimage, and closure of borders shared with other Gulf countries. It is important to note that these measures were implemented before the first case was reported on the 2 nd of March 2020. Conversely, between the time of declaration of COVID-19 as a global emergency by WHO (30 of January) and after the first UK cases (31 of January) no action was taken in the UK.
