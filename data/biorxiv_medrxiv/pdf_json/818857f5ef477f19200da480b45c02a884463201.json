            "text": "The novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 is the causative agent of the acute respiratory disease COVID-19 which has become a global concern due to its rapid spread. Meanwhile, increased demand in testing has led to shortage of reagents, supplies, and compromised the performance of diagnostic laboratories in many countries. Both the world health organization (WHO) and the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommend multi-step RT-PCR assays using multiple primer and probe pairs, which might complicate interpretation of the test results especially for borderline cases. In this study, we describe an alternative RT-PCR approach for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA that can be used for the probe-based detection of clinical isolates in the diagnostics as well as in research labs using a low cost SYBR green method. For the evaluation, we used samples from patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and performed RT-PCR assays along with successive dilutions of RNA standards to determine the limit of detection. We identified an M-gene binding primer and probe pair highly suitable for quantitative detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA for diagnostic and research purposes.",

In order to confirm and further characterize these non-specific products in negative samples, we carried out additional PCR-based analyses. To this end, RNA from pharyngeal swab samples ( Table 1 ) was isolated and subjected to WHO recommended qRT-PCR analysis using E (Figure 1a) and RdRP (Figure 1b) gene specific primers ( Table 2) . As positive controls we used RNA extracted from pharyngeal swabs of one asymptomatic, one mildly symptomatic passenger returning from Wuhan after initial quarantine (Figure 1, Table 1 ), (Hoehl et al., 2020) . Both viral samples were passaged on Caco2 cells as described previously (Bojkova et al., 2020) and the resulting virus containing supernatants (FFM1 and 2) were used for subsequent analysis. Since the RdRP-gene PCR is more specific than the E-gene PCR but is also described as less sensitive (Konrad et al., 2020) , we aimed to develop a novel approach using specifically designed primer and probe pairs. For optimal primer design consensus sequences were aligned to the reference SARS-CoV-2 genome sequence and analyzed for primers binding in E, N, Orf1, M, and S regions (Supplementary Figure 1 ) that would allow SARS-CoV-2 but not SARS-CoV amplification.",

Using the same dilution series of plasmid samples, the M gene based method allowed earlier detection (Figure 2c ). To determine the analytical sensitivity of the M-gene based approach, we additionally used in vitro-transcribed RNA standards and tested four replicates to determine the limit of detection (Figure 2d -f). We were able to detect a single RNA copy per reaction by M-Gene qRT-PCR. SYBR-green based melting curve analysis revealed a melting point at 80\u00b0C for all samples (Supplementary Figure 2) .

In commercially available kits, primers and probes, as well as the buffers and enzyme quantities and properties have been matched to one another to reduce unspecific amplification (Konrad et al., 2020) .

WHO recommended RdRP primer pairs were used for confirmation. As negative controls we included 8 negative samples(Figure 1, Supplementary Table 1). As described above, unspecific E-gene amplicons were detected in a test kit specific manner possibly due to the reagents used(Konrad et   al., 2020). Therefore, we additionally compared the performances of two research kits (New EnglandBiolabs) and one in vitro diagnostic (IVD) certified test kit (Roche Viral Multiplex RNA Kit) using Mgene and RdRP-gene primers. Overall, we observed lower Cq values with all three kits for M-gene when compared to RdRP-gene PCR (Figure 4). Using the Luna OneStep Probe kit (Luna Universal Probe One-Step RT-qPCR Kit, NEB) M-gene PCR was significantly more sensitive among all tested kits with a difference of approx. 10 Cq values Luna Universal Probe One-Step RT-qPCR Kit in comparison to the RdRP specific primer pairs. With the SYBR green based kit (Luna Universal One-Step RT-qPCR Kit) and Roche IVT kit (LightCycler\u00ae Multiplex RNA Virus Master) we observed four and one Cq value differences respectively, verifying that detection of M gene is superior to RdRPgene PCR. To further evaluate whether the newly developed method is also suitable for detecting intracellular virus RNA, we infected Vero and Caco2 cells with SARS-CoV-2 strain FFM1. Using Mgene PCR we were able to detect very low copy numbers of viral RNA in infected Vero cells, while",

In vitro transcription was carried out using the HiScribeT7 High Yield kit (NEB) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Absorbance-based measurement of the RNA yield was performed using the Genesys 10S UV-Vis Spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific).Illumina NGS Sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 isolatesCaco2 cells were infected with different viral strains (FFM1-FFM7) at an MOI 0.01. Cell culture supernatant was harvested 48 h after infection, precleared at 2000xg for 10 min at room temperature.Virus particle containing supernatant (20 ml) was overlaid on 25% sucrose in PBS and centrifuged at 26,000 rpm for 3 h at 4C using SW28 rotor (Beckman Coulter). Pellets were dissolved in PBS overnight at 4C and 1/3 of used for RNA was extraction using Macherey Nagel Virus RNA isolationkit without carrier RNA according to the manufacturer's recommendations. The libraries were prepared and sequenced by GenXPro GmbH, Frankfurt a. M., Germany. Briefly, quality was controlled on a LabChip GXII platform and RNA-seq libraries were prepared using the NEBNext Ultra II Directional RNA-Seq kit according to the manufacturers recommendations. Sequencing was performed on an Illumina NextSeq 500 platform using 75 cycles. Read mapping was performed using NC_045512 as a reference sequence.
