These data 45 emphasize the potential of RDV as a promising countermeasure against the ongoing COVID-19 46 pandemic. 47 replication for each cell type, and infectious viral titer and viral genome copy number in the supernatant 109 were quantified by plaque assay and RT-qPCR, respectively. RDV and GS-441524 potently inhibited 110 SARS-CoV-2 replication in a dose-dependent manner in both cell types ( Fig. 2; Table 1 ). In Calu3 cells, 111 both compounds displayed dose-dependent inhibition of viral replication as determined by plaque assay 112 ( Fig. 2B) and RT-qPCR (Fig. 2C) . RDV inhibited SARS-CoV-2 with an EC50 = 0.28 \u03bcM and EC90 = 2.48 113 \u03bcM. The parent compound GS-441524 was less potent: EC50 = 0.62 \u03bcM, EC90 = 1.34 \u03bcM ( Fig. 2D ; Table  114 1). EC50 values determined by quantification of viral genome copies were roughly two-fold higher than 115 those obtained by quantification of infectious virus ( Fig. 2E; Table 1 ).

Relative 119 potency based on genome copies was similar to that assessed by quantification of infectious viral titer in 120 Vero E6 cells ( Fig. 2H; Table 1 ).

In RDV treated HAE, we observed a dose-dependent 126 reduction in infectious virus production, with >100-fold inhibition at the highest tested concentration 127 (Fig. 3A) . Importantly, RDV demonstrate potent antiviral activity with EC50 values of 0.0010 and 0.009 128 \u00b5M in two independent experiments (Fig. 3B) . We previously reported that RDV is not cytotoxic at doses 129 at or below 10 \u00b5M in this culture system, supporting the conclusion that the observed antiviral effect was 130 virus-specific (Sheahan et al., 2017) . Together, these data demonstrate that RDV is potently antiviral 131 against SARS-CoV-2 in primary human lung cultures with a selectivity index of >1000. in different cell culture models. Both RDV and GS-441524 undergo intracellular conversion to the active 137 metabolite RDV-TP involving several metabolic steps (Fig. S4 ) and the efficiency of each step might 138 differ between cell types.

Drug potency in Vero E6 was similar whether quantified by infectious virus or 228 genome copy number. In Calu3 cells, the potency determined by RT-qPCR was about two-fold lower 229 than when quantified by plaque assay.

Broad-spectrum antiviral drugs, antibodies, and vaccines are needed to combat the 188 current pandemic and those that will emerge in the future. RDV shows potent activity against an array of 189 genetically diverse CoVs as well as against unrelated emerging viruses like Ebola (Agostini et al., 2018; 190 Brown et al., 2019; Sheahan et al., 2017, 2020a; Warren et al., 2016). In this study, we demonstrate that 191 RDV and its parent nucleoside GS-441524 are active against SARS-CoV-2 in a physiologically relevant 192 cell line and that RDV exerts substantially higher antiviral activity in primary human airway cultures. 193 Potency was directly related to the intracellular concentration of pharmacologically active triphosphate 194 metabolite, which was markedly higher in primary HAE cultures compared to human lung cells (Calu3 195 2B4) and monkey kidney cells (Vero E6). Our data are consistent with recent studies demonstrating 196 important contributions of natural variation in host and tissue specific gene expression patterns and 197 microbiome specific contributions to drug metabolism, stability, and bioavailability in different tissues 198 (Eriksson, 2013; Koczor et al., 2012). Modeling of RDV onto the SARS-CoV-2 RdRp revealed that the 199 positioning of the RDV into the active site closely resembled that of cognate natural substrate ATP, 200 consistent with efficient incorporation into RNA during replication of the viral genome. RDV decreased 201 viral loads and improved lung function in mice infected with SARS1/SARS2-RdRp chimeric virus when 202 treated at 1 dpi. This is the first rigorous demonstration of potent inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 in 203 continuous and primary human lung cultures and first study suggesting efficacy of RDV against SARS-204",

In contrast to GS-441524, RDV contains a protective group which 220 facilitates cellular uptake of the nucleoside analog and addition of the first phosphate group, which 221 accelerates conversion to the active triphosphate (Mehellou et al., 2018). Consistent with previous reports 222 (Agostini et al., 2018), RDV showed enhanced inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 over GS-441524 in Calu3 2B4 223 cells. In contrast, RDV was two-fold less potent than GS-441524 in Vero E6 cells.

Together, 241 these results emphasize the need for careful selection and use of multiple cell types and methods to study 242 potency and efficacy of nucleoside analogs and other antiviral compounds. 243 The target of RDV antiviral activity is the viral RdRp. To mirror the pharmacokinetic exposures observed 244 in humans, RDV studies in mice must be performed in Ces1c-/-animals (Sheahan et al., 2017). In 245 addition, SARS-CoV-2 does not readily infect WT mice due to incompatibilities between virus spike and 246 the murine ortholog of ACE2, which serves as the SARS-CoV-2 entry receptor (Wan et al., 2020). The 247 breeding a doubly transgenic (hACE2, Ces1c-/-) mice for use in RDV efficacy studies is ongoing. To 248 rapidly assess the therapeutic efficacy of RDV against SARS-CoV-2, we constructed recombinant SARS-249 CoV-1 chimeric virus encoding the SARS-CoV-2 RdRp (SARS1/SARS2-RdRp). Virus entry, tropism, 250 and pathogenesis of this chimeric virus are driven by parental mouse-adapted SARS-CoV-1 virus. Similar 251 to our previous studies with SARS-CoV-1 (Sheahan et al., 2017), we now show that therapeutic 252 administration of RDV one dpi can both reduce viral load and improve pulmonary function in mice. The 253 kinetics of SARS-CoV-1 replication and disease are notably compressed in mice as compared to humans 254 where virus titer peaks 10-15 days after onset of symptoms (Hung et al., 2004; Peiris et al., 2004). By 255 comparison, initial reports suggest that SARS-CoV-2 replication peaks around 5-6 days after symptom 256 onset, just prior to onset of dyspnea (Pan et al., 2020; Zhou et al., 2020a). A recent preprint described the 257 therapeutic efficacy of RDV against SARS-CoV-2 in rhesus macaques, where RDV treatment reduced 258 respiratory pathology and viral loads in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (Williamson et al., 2020). Prior to 259 the emergence of pandemic SARS-CoV-2, RDV was evaluated in phase 1 clinical trials as well as phase 2 260 randomized controlled trial trials to treat acute Ebola virus disease in the Democratic Republic of Congo 261 (DRC), and human safety data are available (Mulangu et al., 2019). Thus, our preclinical development of 262 RDV positioned RDV for immediate compassionate use of RDV for severely ill COVID-19 patients. 263 While early results are promising (Grein et al., 2020), Phase III randomized controlled trials for the 264 treatment of patients with COVID-19 are ongoing globally and will ultimately determine efficacy, safety, 265 and optimal dosing of RDV in patients with different stages of COVID-19. 266 Despite worldwide drug discovery efforts and over 300 active clinical evaluations of potential treatments, 267 no effective countermeasure currently exists to combat COVID-19 (Sanders et al., 2020) or likely future 268",

In 276 addition, attention should be given to combining DAAs with anti-inflammatory drugs to potentially 277 extend the treatment window during which DAAs can improve outcomes. With SARS-CoV-1-, SARS-278 CoV-2-, and MERS-like CoVs continuing to circulate in bat species, more outbreaks of novel CoVs are 279 expected (Menachery et al., 2015b, 2016). Identification and evaluation of broadly efficacious, robust 280 anti-CoV therapies are thus urgently needed in the present and future. 281 282 ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS 283 This project was funded in part by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National 284 Institutes of Health, Department of Health and Human Service awards: 1U19AI142759 (Antiviral Drug 285 Discovery and Development Center awarded to M.R.D. and R.S.B); 5R01AI132178 awarded to T.P.S. 286 and R.S.B.; and 5R01AI108197 awarded to M.R.D. and R.S.B.

A model of the elongating SARS-CoV-2 polymerase complex was generated based on a 423 homology model which used the cryo-EM structure of apo SARS-CoV-1 as a template (PDB: 6NUR, 424 (Kirchdoerfer and Ward, 2019) as described previously(Gordon et al., 2020b). RNA primer and template, 425 a substrate ATP and two catalytic Mg ++ ions were oriented in the structure based on alignment to a ternary 426x-ray structure of HCV NS5B (PDB: 4WTD,(Appleby et al., 2015). The structure was then optimized 427 with a series of constrained minimizations. To this structure we aligned the new cryo-EM structure of the 428 SARS-CoV-2 replication complex. As the SARS-CoV-2 structure does not significantly differ from the 429 SARS-CoV-1 structure, rather than a complete replacement of the model, we incorporated only those 430 residues that had not been resolved in the previous structure (residues 31-116). Additional optimization, 431 particularly of the RNA in the exit channel, was done following the previously outlined procedures. After432 optimization of the ATP structure, RDV-TP was modeled into the active site and minimized. Models of 433 the V557L and F480L mutants and the other coronavirus models reported here were generated based on 434 this final model.
