With regards to the treatment of COVID-19, no specific approaches so far are available[2]. The use of corticosteroids remains controversial. During the outbreaks of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV and middle east respiratory syndrome (MERS)-CoV, corticosteroids were widely used[3]. Similarly, physicians tend to use corticosteroids in critically ill patients with COVID-19 in addition to other therapeutics[4]. However, someone had been sceptical about its curative effect, especially in higher dosages, which carry long-term side effects. According to current World Health Organization (WHO) guidance[5], Russell[2] recommend that corticosteroids should not be used in SARS-CoV-2-induced lung injury or shock unless indicated for another reason.",

After excluding ineligible patients, 115 patients were included in the study(Figure 1).There were 60 noncritical and 55 critical cases among 115 enrolled COVID-19 patients. The median age of all patients was 59 years (IQR, 40-67), and 58 (50.4%) were men. Of the 115 patients, 42 (36.5%) had 1 or more comorbidities. The most common symptoms at initial stage of illness were fever (111[96.5%]), fatigue (72 [62.6%]) and dry cough (63 [54.8%]). Less common symptoms were nausea or vomiting and headache. Compared with noncritical cases, critical cases were significantly older (median age, 65 years [IQR, 56-69] vs 46 years [IQR, 33-62] ; P <0.001) and were more likely to have underlying comorbidities.

In multivariate analysis, corticosteroid treatment was associated with a 2.155-fold increase in risk of adverse outcome, although not statistically significant.
