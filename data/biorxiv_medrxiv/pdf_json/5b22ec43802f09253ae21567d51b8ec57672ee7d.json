Since the COVID-19 outbreak, the number of confirmed cases of the virus reached 82052 on the Chinese mainland as of the mid-April, and 3339 cases died [1] . Among them, the cumulative confirmed cases in Hubei Province and Wuhan accounted for 74.3% and 43.2% of the total cases in China, respectively, which is the top priority of epidemic prevention and control [2] . Wang et al [3] reported 138 novel coronavirus pneumonia hospitalized patients' clinical characteristics in Wuhan, China. Patients' common symptoms included of fever, fatigue and dry cough. Lymphopenia, prolonged prothrombin time and elevated lactated hydrogenase were occurred in most of hospitalized patients with COVID-19. With the COVID-19 spread rapidly throughout China, Guan et al [4] extracted data from 1099 patients in 30 provinces of mainland China reported that novel coronavirus pneumonia patients often presented without fever, and many did not have abnormal radiologic findings. The understanding of novel coronavirus pneumonia is a gradual exploration process. As so for, prevention and control protocol for Novel Coronavirus Pneumonia issued by General Office of National Health Commission have been updated to the version 7.",

COVID-19 is categorized as beta genus coronavirus, same as the two other strains-human severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-Cov) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-Cov) [3] . Antiviral agents recommended in prevention and control protocol for Novel Coronavirus Pneumonia (version 7) was mainly summarized by the antiviral therapy of MERS-Cov and SARS-Cov [6] . Lopinavir-ritonavir is an HIV protease inhibitors and its registered therapeutics is for the treatment of HIV infection. Lopinavir is screened from FDA-approved compound library that can inhibit MERS-CoV replication in the low-micromolar range. Moreover, lopinavir can also inhibit the replication of SARS coronavirus and human coronavirus 229E [7] . Arbidol is a RNA synthesis inhibitor which is used for the prophylaxis and treatment of Influenza A and B, SARS, Hepatitis B and C, Herpies, Dengue Fever, and RSV. Abidol have been identified effective with anti-coronavirus activity in vitro [8] . Therefore, the efficacy and safety of antiviral drugs in COVID-19 need to be further confirmed by the clinical trials. Meanwhile, there is little information of clinical antiviral therapy on the lopinavir-ritonavir alone or combined with arbidol in the COVID-19 patients. In the present study, we retrospective studied medical records of 73 hospitalized patients with COVID-19 and evaluated the antivirus efficacy of lopinavir/ritonavir alone or combined with arbidol.",

The level of lymphocyte count decreased in both two groups that next to the lower normal limit, the minimum was at 3-5 days after admitted to hospital. Both of the two groups were in low level of lymphocyte at 0-15 days after hospitalization with no significant difference. On the contrary, the level of monocyte was next to the upper normal limit.

Second, there were only 73 COVID-19 cases in this study. According to the study data of lopinavir-ritonavir in the treatment of severe COVID-19 cases [11] , we concluded that the sample size need 300 subjects to evaluate the efficacy of lopinavir-ritonavir combined with abidor was better or worse than that of the single drug treatment of lopinavir-ritonavir. Third, the age and gender of two groups were not balanced because of the small sample. However, there was no significant difference between groups after stratification of gender and age. In the future, increasing the number of research samples can improve the test efficiency and enhance the credibility of research results. Finally, the results of this study suggested that the overall treatment effect of COVID-19 was well. It was difficult to judge the antiviral effect using cure rate and virus turning negative rate as the primary endpoints. Therefore, it may be more feasible in clinical practice to find a more suitable COVID-19 population or primary endpoints for evaluating the therapeutic effect of antiviral drugs, such as evaluating whether it can reduce mortality in severely ill population.",

However, in the modified intention to-treat analysis, which excluded patients with early death and transferred to the ICU, the median hospitalization time of lopinavir-ritonavir combined with abidol group was shorten than lopinavir-ritonavir group (1.25 days vs. 14 days). Of note, the overall mortality of lopinavir-ritonavir combined with abidol group and lopinavir-ritonavir group were 2.6% and 2.9% in this study. It was significantly lower than the 11% to 22.1% mortality reported in previous studies of hospitalized patients with COVID-19 [9] [10] [11] . The main reason was that there were fewer severe cases enrolled in this study. The ratio of heavy COVID-19 in lopinavir-ritonavir combined with abidol group and lopinavir-ritonavir group were 29.2% and 38.2%, resecptively.According to the results, we did not find that two antiviral drugs lopinavir-ritonavir combined with abidol treatment improved clinical symptoms and accelerated virological inhibition compared with single antiviral drug lopinavir-ritonavir treatment. In contrast, the time virus turning negative and the duration time of fever and cough in lopinavir-ritonavir combined with abidol group were longer than lopinavir-ritonavir treatment group. Two consecutive nucleic acid tests were negative, and clinical symptom improvement is the discharge standard of COVID-19 patients. However, the clinical symptoms of some COVID-19 patients had improved,the results of multiple nucleic acid tests were positive and the longest viral shedding was 36 days. It was consistence with the previous study [12] . A recent report showed that the results of nucleic acid re-test of convalescent patients with COVID-19 were positive. Lan et al [13] found that the results of pharyngeal swab nucleic acid test were positive in the follow-up of 4 cured COVID-19 medical staff.",
