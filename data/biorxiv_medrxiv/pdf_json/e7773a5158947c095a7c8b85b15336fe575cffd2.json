For 68 instance, the recent outbreak of Ebola in Africa, which killed over 5,000 people, was most 69 likely spread from bats and primates to humans 1 . The current outbreak of coronavirus disease 70 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the coronavirus severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 71 (SARS-CoV-2) 2 is not the only example of coronaviruses that have recently passed from 72 animals to humans. Coronaviruses are a family of RNA viruses that typically cause respiratory 73 tract infections in humans, yet they are frequently in the reservoir of wild animals with no 74 disease 3 . For example, the common cold is often (10-15%) caused by a coronavirus (e.g. HCoV-75 229E and HCoV-OC43) 4 . However, coronaviruses can also lead to severe and life-threatening 76 diseases. In the early 2000s a coronavirus called SARS-CoV, believed to be passed from bats 77 to humans in South East Asia, caused more than 700 deaths from around 8,000 confirmed 78 cases worldwide 5 . Since 2012, another zoonotic coronavirus believed to have passed from 79 camels to humans in the Middle East was designated as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome 80 (MERS) 6 . To date, there have been over 2,500 confirmed cases of MERS with over 800 deaths. 81",

So far, little is known except for the viral binding via angiotensin 93 converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and subsequent priming by type 2 transmembrane serine 94 protease 2 (TMPRSS2) protease, which are shared mechanisms with SARS and MERS 9, 10 . To 95 test experimental treatments, animal models close to humans are necessary due to sequence 96 5 variation of ACE2 and changes in the proportions of cell subtypes in organs between species. 97 For these reasons, it is essential to have a species close to human to study . In this 98 regard, monkey experiments have shown that infection with SARS-CoV-2 produces clinical 99 manifestations similar to COVID-19 patients 11 .

Additionally, significant 222 TMPRSS2 was observed in both parotid and pancreatic acinar cells, thyroid follicular cells, 223 cholangiocytes and in several lung clusters (Fig. 2b, 2d, Extended Data Fig. 3) . We then 224 9 determined which cells co-expressed both genes (ACE2 + /TMPRSS2 + ). Notably, the largest 225 overlap between ACE2 and TMPRSS2 was observed in the ciliated and club cell clusters of the 226 lung and to a lesser extent the proximal tubule cells of the kidney (Fig. 2c, 2e) . A smaller 227 overlap was also observed in cholangiocytes and in pancreatic islet cells (Fig. 2c, 2e) . 228 Therefore, our data show that ACE2 and TMPRSS2 are expressed in a variety of cell 229 types, mainly epithelial cells, within the nine monkey organs/tissues (Supplementary Table  230 2a). The observed heterogeneity of ACE2 in these cell subtypes also suggests that variations Given the heterogeneous nature of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 expression within monkey tissues, we 237 decided to investigate similarities and differences between human and monkey. For this 238 purpose, we retrieved publicly available data from single-cell studies in human (see methods). 239 TMPRSS2 distribution was similar in cell subtypes of lung, kidney and liver between human 240 and monkey ( Fig. 3d-3f) . However, strikingly, ACE2 showed distinct patterns among cell 241 subtypes in all three organs between the two species ( Fig. 3d-3f) . The biggest differences 242 were observed in ciliated cells of the lung, which had the highest expression of ACE2 in 243 monkey, and pulmonary alveolar type 2 cells, which had the highest expression of ACE2 in 244 human. The function of ciliated cells is to move substances (e.g. cell debris and toxic material) 245 across the surface of the respiratory tract and are commonly targeted by respiratory viruses, 246 whereas pulmonary alveolar type 2 cells have regenerative properties, are crucial for alveolar 247 homeostasis and produce surfactant 24, 25 . In the kidney of both monkey and human, the 248 highest ACE2 expression was in proximal tubule cells (Fig. 3e) , which are responsible for 249 electrolyte and nutrient reabsorption. However, renal endothelial cells had higher expression 250 in monkey compared to human. In liver, cholangiocytes had similarly high ACE2 expression in 251 monkey and human, but hepatocytes showed higher expression and more positive cells in the 252 human (Fig. 3f) . Considering the heterogenous expression of ACE2 within the proximal tubule 253 cells in monkey, we revisited the previously analyzed data and were able to sub cluster this 254 population of cells into two (S1 and S3) based on the expression of SLC5A2 and SLC7A13 26 255 (Extended Data Fig. 4, Supplementary Table 2b ).

Correlated genes were considered as those displaying a coefficient higher 269 than 0.6 with an adjusted P value < 0.001. Using these criteria, we observed several genes 270 with marked correlation, including genes that belong to metabolic and developmental 271 pathways and genes involved in the cellular response to xenobiotic stimuli ( Fig. 4a, b) . The 272 highest correlation was observed for transmembrane protein 27 (TMEM27, cor = 0.84), a 273 protein involved in trafficking amino acid transporters to the apical brush border of kidney 274 proximal tubules 29 . This is unsurprising considering that TMEM27 is an important paralog of 275 ACE2, and high expression was restricted to kidney cells. DnaJ heat shock protein family 276 (Hsp40) member C12 (DNAJC12, cor = 0.78), a gene with a role in immune response 277 processes 30 , had a distribution like TMEM27. Importantly, we also observed high correlation 278 with Indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase 2 (IDO2, cor = 0.77), a gene with abundant expression in 279 kidney and liver cells that was also expressed in the lung and other organs. IDO2 functions 280 during the early phases of immune responses and promotes inflammatory autoimmunity 31, 281 32 . ANPEP, which encodes for alanyl aminopeptidase N, was also co-expressed with ACE2 in 282 kidney, liver and to a lesser extent in lung too (cor = 0.64), like IDO2 (Fig. 4c, d) . Interestingly, 283",

To understand whether epigenetic mechanisms underlie the heterogeneity of ACE2 294 expression in the kidney, as representative for other organs, we employed DNBelab C4 295 technology to perform high-throughput single-cell ATAC-seq (Fig. 5a) . After filtering, 6,353 296 nuclei were used for downstream analysis (Extended Data Fig. 5a , b, Supplementary Table  297 4). We integrated these data with the kidney transcriptomic data described in Fig. 1 and 298 proceeded to perform Louvain clustering to map all the different cell types within the dataset 299 ( Fig. 5b) . Consistent with the transcriptomic data, our epigenomic mapping identified thick 300 ascending limb cells and proximal tubule cells as the largest kidney clusters (Extended Data 301 ACE2 locus, with the highest signal detected in proximal tubule cells S1 and S3, which are also 305 the highest ACE2-expressing cells (Fig. 5d) . Our approach failed to detect significant signal 306 enrichment in the ACE2 locus in endothelial cells, possibly related to the low level of 307 expression (Fig. 5d) . Within the cells of the kidney we observed the highest percentage of 308 ACE2 + cells in the proximal tubule S3, with a lower percentage in the proximal tubule S1 and 309 endothelial cells (Fig. 5e) . Motif analysis within the open chromatin regions in ACE2 + cells 310 demonstrated that these regions were preferentially enriched in STAT1 and 3 and IRF1 311 binding sites (Fig. 5f) . These findings suggested that tissue protective cytokines including IL5, 312 IL6, EGF and interferons are acting on these proximal tubule cells S3 to induce ACE2. We 313 focused on IL6 because a recent clinical trial has been started that uses anti-IL6 receptor (IL6R) 314 antibodies in the treatment of COVID-19 315 (http://www.chictr.org.cn/showprojen.aspx?proj=49409). IL6 is a potent regulator of 316 immune responses and can be produced by a variety of interstitial cells including fibroblasts, 317 endothelial cells and more importantly tissue macrophages 36 . Interestingly, we also noticed 318 that distribution of IL6R correlated well with ACE2 in proximal tubule cells (Fig. 5g, Extended  319 Data Fig. 5d) . In human kidney a similar co-expression pattern was detected (Fig. 5h) . 320 . CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International license (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder.

In this study, we have generated a single-cell transcriptomic atlas of nine organs (liver, 337 kidney, lung, pancreas, neocortex, aorta, parotic gland, thyroid and peripheral blood) from 338 cynomolgus monkey. We used this dataset not only to provide fundamental information 339 about the cellular composition of the different tissues tested but also as a platform to dissect 340 the overall expression distribution of the SARS-CoV-2 entry receptor, ACE2, and its serine 341 protease coactivator TMPRSS2 9, 10 . Interestingly, ACE2 was expressed in multiple epithelial 342 tissues besides the lung, especially the kidney and liver. Other organs of epithelial origin such 343 as the gut have also been implicated in the pathogenesis of the disease 38 . A consequence of 344 this is that the SARS2-CoV-2 virus could infect these organs too, which would explain some of 345 the reported clinical manifestations of COVID-19 2 . By comparing our dataset with publicly 346 available human single-cell RNA-seq data, we have also uncovered significant differences in 347 cell subtypes expressing ACE2 between human and monkey. We showed different expression 348 patterns for ACE2 in the lung, where the highest levels were detected in ciliated cells in 349 monkey and pulmonary alveolar type 2 cells in human. Similarly, we observed marked 350 differences in liver, in which monkey hepatocytes displayed higher ACE2 and a larger number 351 of positive cells compared to the human.

We 358 observed high expression of IDO2 and ANPEP in kidney, liver and lung. Expression of these 359 genes can be further induced by viral infection and they have been reported to be immune 360 modulators and/or mediate viral entry 31, 33 . These observations are relevant as they highlight 361 new potential therapeutic vulnerabilities in the current emergency. In this respect, a number 362 of inhibitors of ANPEP are currently being tested in several disease contexts and could serve 363 to prevent the immune cell exhaustion often observed in many severe COVID-19 cases 39 . 364 Similarly, mesenchymal stem/stroma cells (MSC) have immunomodulatory functions that are 365 partly related to IDO2 production 31 . It is tempting, thus, to speculate that cell therapies based 366 on MSC delivery could ameliorate COVID-19 by normalizing immune function and preventing 367 cytokine storms 40 . 368 Intriguingly, in our data, we see heterogenous expression of ACE2 within the individual 369 cell subtypes in six out of the nine monkey organs that we analyzed, which is also the case in 370 the three human organs analyzed. In this regard, we noticed two different cell populations in 371 the kidney proximal tubule, one with higher ACE2 expression than the other. We performed 372 single-cell ATAC-seq of this organ to understand whether this phenomenon has an epigenetic 373 basis. Analysis of open chromatin regions within the ACE2 locus revealed the enrichment of 374 STAT1, STAT3 and IRF1 binding sites. These transcription factors have important immune 375 functions and are direct targets of tissue protective and innate immune responses such as 376 Interleukin-6 signaling pathway and interferons. Analysis of IL6R distribution showed broad 377 expression within different the ACE2 + organs in monkey and human. This suggests a link 378 between paracrine IL6 (e.g. secreted by stromal cells including tissue resident macrophages) 379 and enhanced ACE2 expression across different organs. Higher and more widespread ACE2 380 expression could promote increased viral entry. This observation could be very relevant given 381 recent reports describing clinical trials with Tocilizumab, a monoclonal antibody used for IL6R 382 blockade in patients with rheumatoid arthritis 41 , for the treatment of COVID-19 383(http://www.chictr.org.cn/showprojen.aspx?proj=49409).

The monkey was anesthetized with ketamine 405 hydrochloride (10 mg/kg) and barbiturate (40 mg/kg) administration before being euthanized 406 by exsanguination. Tissues were isolated and placed on the ice-cold board for dissection. 407Whole organs including lung, kidney, pancreas, liver, brain, thyroid, parotid gland, and aorta 408 were cut into 5-10 pieces, respectively (50-200 mg/piece). Samples were then quickly frozen 409 in liquid nitrogen and stored until nuclear extraction was performed.PBMC  were isolated 410 from heparinized venous blood using a Lymphoprep TM medium (STEMCELL Technologies, 411 #07851) according to standard density gradient centrifugation methods. PBMC were 412 resuspended in 90% FBS, 10% DMSO (Sigma Aldrich, #D2650) freezing media and frozen using 413 a Nalgene\u00ae Mr. Frosty\u00ae Cryo 1\u00b0C Freezing Container (Thermo Fisher Scientific, #5100-0001) 414 in a -80\u00b0C freezer for 24 hours before being transferred to liquid nitrogen for long-term 415 storage. 416 417 Single-nucleus/cell suspension preparation. 418 We isolated nuclei as previously described 45 . Briefly, tissues were thawed, minced and added 419 to lysis buffer. Lysates were filtered and resuspended in cell resuspension buffer. Frozen 420 PBMC vials were rapidly thawed in a 37\u00b0C water bath for ~2 minutes, then quenched with 10 421 ml 37\u00b0C pre-warmed 1X phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, Thermo Fisher Scientific, 422 #10010031) supplemented with 10% FBS. PBMCs were centrifuged at 500 R.C.F. for 5 minutes 423 at room temperature. The supernatant was removed, and the cell pellet was resuspended in 424 3 ml 37\u00b0C pre-warmed 1X PBS containing 0.04% bovine serum albumin (BSA, Sangon Biotech, 425A600903), passed through a 40 \u03bcm cell strainer (Falcon, #352340) and then centrifuged at 426 500 R.C.F. for 5 minutes at room temperature. Nuclei or cells were resuspended with cell 427 resuspension buffer at a concentration of 1,000 cells/\u03bcl for single-cell library preparation. 428 (Liu et al. 2019). In brief, single-nucleus/cell suspensions were used for 432 droplet generation, emulsion breakage, beads collection, reverse transcription, and cDNA 433 amplification to generate barcoded libraries. Indexed single-cell RNA-seq libraries were 434 constructed according to the manufacturer's protocol. The sequencing libraries were 435 quantified by Qubit\u2122 ssDNA Assay Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, #Q10212). Single-cell ATAC-436 seq libraries were prepared using DNBelab C Series Single-Cell ATAC Library Prep Set (MGI, 437 #1000021878). DNA nanoballs (DNBs) were loaded into the patterned Nano arrays and 438 sequenced on the ultra-high-throughput DIPSEQ T1 sequencer using the following read 439 length: 30 bp for read 1, inclusive of 10 bp cell barcode 1, 10 bp cell barcode 2 and 10 bp 440 unique molecular identifier (UMI), 100 bp of transcript sequence for read 2, and 10 bp for 441 sample index. 442 443 Single-cell RNA-seq data processing. 444 Raw sequencing reads from DIPSEQ-T1 were filtered and demultiplexed using PISA (version 445 0.2) (https://github.com/shiquan/PISA). Reads were aligned to Macaca_fascicularis_5.0 446 genome using STAR (version 2.7.4a) 46 and sorted by sambamba (version 0.7.0) 47 . Cell versus 447 gene UMI count matrix was generated with PISA. 448 449 Cell clustering and identification of cell types. 450 Clustering analysis of the complete cynomolgus monkey tissue dataset was performed using 451 Scanpy (version 1.4) 48 in a Python environment. Parameters used in each function were 452 manually curated to portray the optimal clustering of cells. In preprocessing, cells or nuclei 453 were filtered based on the criteria of expressing a minimum of 200 genes and a gene which 454 is expressed by a minimum of 3 cells or nuclei. Filtered data were ln (counts per million 455 (CPM)/100 + 1) transformed. 3000 highly variable genes were selected according to their 456 average expression and dispersion. The number of UMI and the percentage of mitochondrial 457 gene content were regressed out and each gene was scaled by default options. Dimension 458 reduction starts with principal component analysis (PCA), and the number of principal 459 components used for UMAP depends on the importance of embeddings. The Louvain method 460 dataset was portrayed using the Seurat package (version 3.1.1) 49 in R environment 464 by default parameters for filtering, data normalization, dimensionality reduction, clustering, 465 and gene differential expression analysis. Finally, we annotated each cell type by extensive 466 literature reading and searching for the specific gene expression pattern. 467 468 Gene correlation and Gene Ontology (GO) term enrichment analysis. 469 The correlation between ACE2 and other genes was drawn using Pearson correlation 470 coefficient (PCC) with gene expression value merged from cells of the same cell types with 471 the R package psych (version 1.9.12.31). To infer the biological function of highly correlated 472 genes (cor > 0.6 and adjusted P value < 0.001), we performed gene set enrichment analysis 473 using Metascape (https://metascape.org/gp/index.html). 474 475 Differential gene expression analysis. 476 Differential expression analysis between proximal tubule S1 and proximal tubule S3 was 477 performed using the FindMarkers function of the Seurat package (version 3.1.1). 478 479 Single-cell ATAC-seq data processing. 480 Raw sequencing reads from DIPSEQ-T1 were filtered and demultiplexed using PISA (version 481 0.2) (https://github.com/shiquan/PISA). Peak calling was performed using MACS2 (version 482 2.1.2) 50 with options -f BAM -B -q 0.01 -nomodel. The cell versus peak reads count matrix was 483 generated by custom script. To create a gene activity matrix, we extracted gene coordinates 484 for cynomolgus monkey from NCBI, and extended them to \u00b12 kb region around TSS. The gene 485 activity score matrix was calculated by custom script. 486 487 Single-cell ATAC-seq cell clustering and cell type identification. 488 Cells with low fragments (<1,000) and TSS proportion (<0.1) were removed. Then, filtered 489 data were imported into R and the dimensionality was reduced by latent semantic indexing. 490 Anchors between single-cell ATAC-seq and single-cell RNA-seq datasets were identified and 491 used to transfer cell type labels identified from the single-cell RNA-seq data. We embedded 492 factor motif enrichment analysis. 496 To predict the motif footprint in peaks within the ACE2 promoter, we extracted genome 497 sequences in the peak region with Seqkit (version 0.7.0) 51 . The sequences were imported into 498 R and were matched with all Homo sapiens motifs form JASPAR2018 using matchMotifs 499 function in motifmatchr packages version 1.8.0 with default parameter. 500 501 Human single-cell RNA-seq datasets. 502 All human single-cell RNA-seq data matrix were obtained from publicly available dataset as 503 described: (1) Kidney data from Stewart et al. was download from 504 https://www.kidneycellatlas.org/ 52 ; (2) Lung data from Madissoon et al. was download from 505 https://www.tissuestabilitycellatlas.org/ 53 ; (3) Liver data from Aizarani et al. used for processing the single-cell RNA-seq and single-cell ATAC-seq will be 510 available at https://github.com/brucepan10/NHP-COVID-19. 511 512 Data availability 513 All raw data have been deposited to CNGB Nucleotide Sequence Archive (accession code: 514 CNP0000986; https://db.cngb.org/cnsa/project/CNP0000986/public/Xiaoyun Huang and Miaomiao Jiang of the Zhiyu Center for Systems Biology, Zhiyu 520 Inc., Shenzhen for their support.
