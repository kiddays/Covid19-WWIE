Based on the transmission mechanisms and physicochemical properties of betacoronaviruses, we construct a fine-grained transmission dynamics model (ICRD) to forecast the crucial information of public concern, therein using dynamical coefficients to quantify the impact of the implement time and intensity of containment policies on the spread of epidemic. We find that the comprehensive investigation policy for susceptible population and the quarantine for suspected cases eminently contribute to reduce casualties during the phase of the dramatic increase of diagnosed cases. Statistic evidences strongly suggest that society should take such forceful public health interventions to cut the infection channels in the initial stage until the pandemic is interrupted.",

In practical, the boundaries of these four transmissions are ambiguous and the number of asymptomatic infections and secondary infections caused by them is difficult to count. Therefore, we generally assume that the non-isolated infected individuals are the main propagating sources on social networks. We divide the statues of the population into 5 categories: (H)ealthy, (I)nfected, (C)onfirmed, (R)ecovered and (D)ead (Fig. 1 ). More granular, the infected group I consists of the confirmed C and unconfirmed I \u2212 C and therein the confirmed individuals C are either isolated \u03b2C (\u03b2 is the isolation rate) or non-isolated (1\u2212\u03b2)C.

Hence \u2202 t I quantifies the aggregate incremental cases of infection (Eq. (1)) after removing the recovered and dead population. Limiting to the objective medical testing ability of laboratories, only a fraction of \u03b7 suspected cases could receive diagnosis within the unit statistical time (\u03b7 is the algebraic mapping of investigation policy), so the increment of confirmed cases \u2202 t C equals to the difference between the newly positive diagnosed cases \u03b7(I \u2212 C) and dead or recovered cases (\u03c3 + \u03ba)C.

The constant coefficients in Eq. (1-4) assume that the containment efforts or the physical and chemical characteristics of the coronavirus remain permanent in long-term transmission, and undoubtedly it is counterintuitive. In fact, the governments tend to adopt more compulsive policies as the dramatic increase of death cases, residents choose isolate themselves spontaneously with more publicity on negative news, and the testing and diagnosis techniques would be visibly improved after the deeply studying of the virus's properties. Hence the measures and intensity of the society to fight the pandemic change in different phases. For instance, initially, due to the lack of awareness of the virus, people are reluctant to maintain social distancing with others (R 0 and \u03b1 are relatively large), so the virus has explosive infectivity at this stage. Subsequently, with the exponential increase of infected cases, the government would announce voluntary or compulsive isolation policies to reduce \u03b1 until it remains low (Fig. 2a) . Furthermore, many susceptible patients cannot be diagnosed because of the limited medical resource in the preliminary stage. However, the promotion of the testing techniques and the enhancement of the investigation policies (\u03b7 rises) would strongly reverse this situation in the successive stages. Therefore, we introduce the dynamic coefficients to simulate the transformation of propagation: determine the boundaries of \u03b1 (or \u03b7) that catch intensity scope of the isolation (investigation) policies and b (or v) is a critic to evaluate the response time of these policies, both regulating 6 All rights reserved.

We suggest that the governments or communities should adopt the containments such as comprehensive investigating and tracking the temperature and traces information about the residents, immediately isolating the suspected and diagnosed infected individuals to prevent the spread of COVID-19 on social networks. Although such near-compulsory national policies may cause severe economic recession or ethical problems, we must realize that society is a community of life composed of all human beings, and we profoundly influence each other whereupon we should collaborate to fight this vital pandemic together. Given that there are no target therapeutics or vaccine currently, each of us should cooperate with these policies in a responsible manner, isolate ourselves from others, form an island, and ultimately prevent the spread of the virus.

The infected patients would die or produce antibodies without treatment but undoubtedly the herd immunity would take a long time to achieve and uncountable individuals would lose their lives in this process. Therefore, the diagnosed patients should be isolated from social networks to cut the transmission links (yellow edges). Furthermore, the red edges are more dangerous for the exposed persons and the comprehensive investigation policy for all people and the nucleic acid testing strategy for symptomatic patients should be taken to remove their connections with others.

The average number of secondary infections an infected would induce over the period from infected to isolated T (transmission is terminated) is defined as the basic reproduction number R 0 . The infectiousness intensity in a unit period is \u03b1 = R 0 /T and the new increase of infected individuals thereby are \u03b1(I \u2212 \u03b2C). Apparently, \u03b1 is inversely proportional to social distancing, determining the increment of infected cases each day and tuning \u03b1 could capture the effect of national isolation policies subtly. Nevertheless, one person would be repeatedly secondarily infected with high probability when the infection density in the community reaches a critical level and above statistic value significantly greater than the true value. We then present a harmonic function (1 \u2212 (I/N ) \u2212\u03b3 ) to tackle the redundancy counting dilemma, in which N represents the community population and \u03b3 denotes the harmonic coefficient. \u03b1(1\u2212(I/N ) \u2212\u03b3 ) shows the infectivity of an individual would degrade as the group density of infection increases.

Inversely, postponing the quarantine policies for 4 (or 7) days would induce another 15,900 (or 53,753) people to be infected and increase the death toll to 5,454 (or 6,783). The advancement or delay of the investigation policies would also cause similar results, but their intensity is softer than the isolation policies. For instance, the comprehensive investigation order issued 7 or 12 days earlier would protect 9,567 or 15, 709people from infection, respectively. Meanwhile, benefiting from the quarantine of suspected persons, medical pressure would be relieved and then 661 or 940 sufferers would be rescued from death. Nevertheless, if such policies were delayed for 17 days, more than a quarter of contacts would be infected or die considering that the increasing of suspected nodes on social networks incredibly shorten their connections with the healthy nodes. Accordingly, the above evidences definitely exhibit that this pandemic is extremely sensitive to the public health interventions, particularly in the initial stage, which can forcefully cut off the possible transmission routes of COVID-19.

(A) tuning the parameter b of \u03b1 can subtly regulate the implement time of isolation policy. We choose \u03b1 = 0.4 as the critical value for isolation which this policy is fully implemented. The practical isolation policy curve b = 0.10 (Feb. 17th) is selected as the baseline to compare results caused by advancing or postponing of this policy. The boundaries of \u03b1 \u2208 [1.8, 0.2] are determined by the basic reproduction number R 0 and the duration from infected to infected. (B) tuning the parameter v of \u03b7 can reflect the rate of community investigation for the infected but undiagnosed patients. We choose \u03b7 = 0.5 as the threshold of daily investigation rate and v = 0.05 (Feb. 24th) as the baseline to compare the impact of the implement time of investigation policy to the pandemic trend. The boundaries of \u03b7 \u2208 [0.2, 0.7] are determined by the case capacity of the hospitals.",
