The results indicate that the IFR of COVID-19 may be an order of magnitude smaller than the current consensus, with the corollary that the virus is more prevalent than currently believed. These results emerge from a simple model and ought to be treated with caution. They emphasise the value of rapid community-scale antibody testing when this becomes available.",

In [1] the COVID-19 Response Team at the MRC Centre for Global Infectious Disease Analysis at Imperial College propose a semi-mechanistic Bayesian hierarchical model to attempt to infer the impact of the various non-pharmaceutical interventions (self-isolation, social distancing, ban of public events, school closure and complete lockdown) from the time series of daily deaths in 11 European countries, later extended to 14 countries [2] . The timing of these interventions in the different countries is known, and this allows their impacts to be separated in the data. The model is a stochastic implementation of the classic SIR (susceptible-infected-removed) model structure in which individuals transition between these states over time. The results from the model of [1] can be viewed online at https://mrc-ide.github.io/covid19estimates/#/. We are grateful to the Imperial College COVID-19 Response Team for the exemplary accessibility and clarity of their work, including making their code available on GitHub at https://github.com/ ImperialCollegeLondon/covid19model. The model assumes that each intervention reduces the basic reproductive number R 0 for the virus by a constant factor to R t , starting on the day t that the intervention is imposed. This factor is assumed to be the same in all countries; only the date of the intervention differs between countries. This assumption allows the pooling of the data from all countries to extract the maximum amount of information. We will refer to this model as the 'Flaxman model' below.",

In Subfigures 2i and 2ii we compare the daily infection rate, daily death rate and daily reproductive number (R t ) estimates for the UK consistent with versions of the Flaxman model equipped with priors (1) and (2), respectively. The smaller IFR * m values, made accessible by the relaxed prior (2) but informed by the European data via the model, lead to correspondingly larger estimates for the number of daily infections over March and April. The death rates and the implied effects of interventions on R 0 to produce R t , however, are affected to a much smaller degree. We note that the additional uncertainty introduced by prior (2) also leads to considerable additional uncertainty for these infection estimates. Table 1 shows the (95%) credible intervals of possible fractions of the population in each country that have been infected, for our estimated IFR and for the fixed IFR of [1] . Its most salient feature is that, despite the apparently narrow posterior distribution of \u00b5 in Figure 1 , the range is large: in the UK, anywhere between 2.3% and 71% may already have been infected -that is, between 1.6 million and 48 million people.
