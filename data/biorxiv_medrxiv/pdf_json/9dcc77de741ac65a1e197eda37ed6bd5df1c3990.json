Negative 122 agreement was 100% (95% CI 83.4 -100%) and 92.0% (95% CI 72.4 -98.6%) for ID Now and 123 Xpert, respectively. Both ID Now and Xpert showed 100% positive agreement for medium and 124 high viral concentrations, defined as C t value <30. However, for C t values >30, positive 125 agreement for ID Now was 34.3% (95% CI 19.7 -52.2%), whereas it was 97.1% (95% CI 83.4 -126 99.8%) for Xpert. Notably, one sample detected by Xpert was a presumptive positive based on 127",
