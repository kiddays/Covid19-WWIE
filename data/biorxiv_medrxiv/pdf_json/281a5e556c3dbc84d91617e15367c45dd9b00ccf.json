We find that the number of cases in April 22 varies between 506 and 2 026 infected cases. We also focus on the reproductive number in Palestine based on population dynamics with two SEIR models. Dataset is from 5 March to 22 April 2020. With a transmission rate equal to 4.55 10 \u22126 , on May 22, the simulations predict 11 014 total infected cases in the optimistic scenario and 113 171 in the worst one. The crest of the pandemic is from 22 to 27 May 2020. The reproductive number R 0 is equal to 1.54 for a fixed fraction of 0.6 of symptomatic cases that are reported and for a removal rate of 7. Palestinian COVID-19 mortality number is equal to 6 per million. It is small compared to countries neighboring Palestine. The infected number is equal to 88.4 per million, which is less than most of its neighbors. The basic reproduction number is still greater than 1. Changes to the transmission rate (over time) would be advisable, to fall R 0 below the critical threshold.",

To answer these questions, we developed mathematical models that recover from data of reported cases and the number of unreported cases for the COVID-19 epidemic in Palestine. 1 We use a set of reported data to model the epidemic in Palestine: data of Table 4 is shared by the Palestinian Ministry of Health. It represents the epidemic transmission in Palestine. The first case was detected on March 5, 2020 . Four deaths are reported on 22 April 2020 with more than 466 total number of infected cases. The three phases of COVID-19 epidemics can be decomposed as a linear phase, an exponential growth, and a decreasing stage. The linear growth in the number of reported cases (from 5 March to 31 March) is where the number of daily reported cases is almost constant day after day. The second phase of the epidemic corresponds to an exponential increasing phase, it starts on April 1st, 2020. The third phase of the epidemic corresponds to a time-dependent exponentially decreasing transmission rate, due to major public interventions and social distancing measures [5] .",

The second group of countries is Israel, Turkey, Iran, and Saudi Arabia (334.1 for Saudi Arabia and 1610 for Israel per million people). The number of death cases also gives two blocks: one with Israel, Turkey, Iran (21, 27, 63 per million people). And a second one with the rest of the 7 other countries (0.6 per million for Palestine, 0.7 per million for Jordan and 3 per million for Lebanon). Figure 13 shows a good management of the epidemic by Palestine, especially on the number of deaths, compared to countries neighboring Palestine. In the case of Palestine, the peak of the epidemic occurred approximately May 22. Accordingly to the SEIR model with asymptomatic and symptomatic compartments, the total number of cases reaches a maximum of approximately 11 014 cases near the turning point May 22. The worst scenario predicts 113 171 infected cases (with a classic SEIR approach). The crest of the pandemic is from 22 to 27May 2020. The reproductive number R 0 is equal to 1.54 for a fixed fraction of f = 0.6 of symptomatic cases that are reported and for a removal rate of \u03bd = 7. The epidemic can be contained in Palestine, provided that quality of care and social distancing measures are in place.
