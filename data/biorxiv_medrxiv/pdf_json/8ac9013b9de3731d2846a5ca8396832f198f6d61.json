Among the nucleoside analogue drugs, there are more studies on purines (3) . It has been proved purinergic signaling is involved in hormone secretion, penile erection, sperm motility and capacitation, and mucous production. As a similar competitor to adenosine triphosphate (ATP), GS-5734 can competitively combine and inhibit RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP) of many RNA viruses, including Fibrovirus (Ebola), Coronavirus (COVID-19), Flaviviridae (Hepatitis C virus), thereby inhibiting virus replication (4) (5) (6) . In 2020, Remdesivir as a novel and promising medicine for COVID-2019 has gained Orphan Drug designation from FDA. However, the potential biological toxicity of nucleoside analogue drugs is far from being well evaluated. Such antiviral drugs including acyclovir (7) and ribavirin (8) have been shown to have teratogenic effects. In addition, continuous high-dose administration will cause a decrease in semen quality in rats. The development of testicular Sertoli cells, prostate, and seminal vesicles will slow down. The abundance of testosterone in serum will also decrease (7). The human reproductive system is highly sensitive to chemicals and due to the totipotency of the germ cells, this effect may be magnified with gamete fertilization and embryo development, resulting in a huge impact on the progeny. Therefore, in consideration of the reproductive safety of patients and their offspring, the cytotoxicity and genotoxicity of GS-5734 on the mammalian reproductive system should be systematically studied.",

The results showed that, compared with the control group (normal spermatogenesis, the score of 10); the HE staining results of Group 2 showed that 10 \u03bc g drugs had no significant effect on the testicular functions (Fig. 4A) ; the spermatogenesis of the 50 \u03bc g group (Group 3) changed slightly, and there were many late stage sperm cells and sperms in the seminiferous tubules, and the arrangement was disordered; there were exfoliated spermatogenic cells in the lumen (Fig. 4B) , the scores were between 8 to 9. The highest dose group with 150 \u03bc g drugs (Group 4) was significantly affected under microscopic observation, the late stage sperm cells and sperms were greatly reduced or even disappeared, the early sperm cells were less or disappeared (Fig. 4C) , and even fibrosis of testicular tissues and cell structure disappeared (Fig.   4D ), The scores were between 5 to 8. Further observation of the sperm distribution in the epididymal tissue slices revealed that there were high concentrations of sperms in the epididymal ducts of Group 2 (Fig. 5A) ; the epididymal sperm concentrations of Group 3 were slightly reduced, but the overall concentrations were still high (Fig. 5B) ; The sperm concentrations of Group 4 were significantly reduced and seen occasionally (Fig. 5C ), or even invisible (Fig. 5D) .

But the side effects were also highlighted which included 32 patients (60%) were elevated liver enzymes, diarrhea, rash, renal dysfunction, and hypertension; a total of 12 (23%) patients experienced severe side effects, including multiple organ dysfunction syndromes, septic shock, acute kidney injury, and hypertension (9) . The study of the effect of GS-5734 on the male mice reproductive function provides a reference for the possible reproductive toxicity to humans. Currently, GS-5734 is recommended for intravenous administration in humans according to clinical guidelines. Due to the limitation of water solubility (about 0.33 mg/mL), the mice were administered by intraperitoneal injection for large volume injections in this study. The general dosage of GS-5734 administered in humans is 100 mg/person/day (9), converted to bodyweight dose is about 1-2 mg/kg/day. In this study, we used a dose of 10, 50, 150 \u03bc g/mouse/day for mice, which are converted to about 0.4, 2, 6 mg/kg/day for bodyweight dose. The intermediate dose (50 \u03bc g/mouse/day) is close to the human dose and was continuously administered for 10 days, then measured after 7 days of stopping the medicine.

In the lower concentration drug group (10 \u03bc g/mouse/day), these parameters have no significant difference compared with the control group (0 \u03bc g/mouse/day). Further study of the highest dose group (150 \u03bc g/mouse/day) found that all parameters of this group were significantly affected. The sperm concentration and motility in the epididymal ducts of this group were significantly reduced, and the proportion of abnormal sperms were significantly increased. The testicular and epididymal tissue slices showed that the spermatogenesis of mice was significantly affected, the testicular tissues appeared fibrosis and loss of function, and the sperm in the epididymides were also significantly reduced or even disappeared. These results indicated that continuous high-dose (150 \u03bc g/mouse/day) use of GS-5734 for 10 days could adversely affect the spermatogenic and sperm parameters of the testes of male mice, and the effects would not recover within 1 week of stopping the medicine. In summary, controlling the dosage and the interval between drug withdrawal and fertilization are the key considerations for reducing the reproductive toxicity and offspring malformation risk. As one of the drug candidates against the epidemic, GS-5734 mainly exerts antiviral therapeutic effects against the COVID-19 virus. It has been reported that the COVID-19 virus has damaging effects on the male reproductive system and kidneys, such as orchitis and causing sterility (15, 16). The balance between the treatment of reproductive damage caused by viruses and the reproductive toxicity caused by the drug may be an interesting research content. However, COVID-19-infected critically ill patients are mostly elderly patients, their reproductive system function may be weakened by age and is no longer a maintenance focus. It may be necessary to pay more attention to the assessment of reproductive toxicity during the medication of young and child-bearing people.",
