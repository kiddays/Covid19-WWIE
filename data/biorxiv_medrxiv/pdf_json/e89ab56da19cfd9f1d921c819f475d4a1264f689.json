Therefore, we can preliminarily conclude that the selectivity 188 index (SI) of HCQ is higher than that of CQ in most cell types.

As 202 shown in Figure 3 , we systematically compared the toxicity between CQ and HCQ, 203 the R TTCC value of CQ is 6-87 times more than that of HCQ in lung, heart, kidney and 204 liver, which suggests that the toxicity risk of HCQ in the above tissues is much lower 205 than that of CQ. were obtained as previously reported. The lung to blood concentration ratio for CQ 233 and HCQ (obtained from animal studies) was used to predict the drug concentration in 234 the lungs, heart, liver, and kidney. To better investigate the potential toxicity in vivo 235 and in vitro, we proposed R TTCC (ratio of tissue concentration and CC 50 ) derived from 236 PBPK model to predict the risk of toxic profiles in different tissues. We compared the 237 R TTCC data collected from heart, liver, kidney, lung, and revealed HCQ has shown 238 significantly safe profiles than that of upon CQ treatment (9). However, recent 239 publication reported that CQ was safer than HCQ according to SI (7, 9). We speculate 240 that the safety difference might be due to their complex pharmacokinetic 241 characteristics in vivo, which possessed specific distribution and long half-life of 242 around days. In short, based on our just published study, we further developed the 243 novel parameters to predict the potential toxicity besides the traditional selectivity 244 index (SI), (the ratio of the CC 50 to EC 50 ), which is a commonly accepted to measure 245 the window between cytotoxicity and antiviral capacity (9). As a result, our data 246 shows that kidney, lung and heart are prone to the toxicity of CQ, otherwise lung and 247 kidney are relative vulnerable upon HCQ treatment ( Figure 5 ). In the meantime, In this study, we perform dynamic imaging system to accurately and precisely 255 monitor the whole proliferation process other than conventional CCK8 assay. ",

Unfortunately, at present, there are still no 98 specific antiviral drugs for prevention or treatment of COVID-19 patients. Recent 99 publications have demonstrated that chloroquine (CQ) and hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) 100 efficiently inhibited SARS-CoV-2 infection in vitro assay (7-9). CQ, together with its 101 derivate HCQ, has been commercialized as antimalarial drugs in the clinic for several 102 decades. HCQ has also been broadly used in autoimmune diseases treatment, such as 103 systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and rheumatoid arthtitis (10-13). Several clinical 104 trials have confirmed that both CQ and HCQ were superior to the control group in 105 inhibiting the exacerbation of pneumonia, improving lung imaging findings, as well 106 as promoting the virus negative conversion and shorten the disease course. 11 107 Moreover, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) also approved CQ and 108 HCQ for emergency use to treat hospitalized patients for COVID-19. Although 109 exhibiting apparent efficacy and acceptable safety profile for COVID-19 treatment, 110 CQ and HCQ still have some potential concerns with prolonged usage, including 111 heart rhythm disturbances, gastrointestinal upset, retinal toxicity, in particular for risk of liver and renal impairment when it used to treat COVID-19(18). 114 Toxicity tolerability in key tissues about drug effectiveness and side effect were 115 critical to understand their mechanism and to optimize dosing regimen by integrating 116 predicted tissue concentrations (TCs) of both drugs in patients. Therefore, comparison 117 of tissue tolerable concentration and predicted concentration in each given tissue and 118 cell line scan be utilized to suggest dosing optimizing strategy for patients infected by 119 COVID-19, especially in high risk populations. In current study, 8 different types of 120 cell lines including retina, myocardium, lung, liver, kidney, vascular endothelium and 121 intestinal epithelium originated cells were included in the cytotoxic evaluation with 122 the presence of CQ or HCQ in 0-72 h on Incucyte S3 device, which could perform 123 long-term continuous imaging and provide the cellular proliferation pattern upon drug 124 treatment. Consequently, the selectivity index (SI= CC 50 /TCs) of CQ and HCQ 125 combined with the predicted tissue concentration based on PBPK model was 126",
