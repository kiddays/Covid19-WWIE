Although more than 14,000 research articles on COVID-19 have been published with the disease taking a pandemic proportion, clinicians and researchers are struggling to distill knowledge for furthering clinical management and research. In this study, we address this gap for a targeted user group, i.e. clinicians, researchers, and policymakers by applying natural language processing to develop a CovidNLP dashboard in order to speed up knowledge discovery. The WHO has created a repository of about more than 5000 peer-reviewed and curated research articles on varied aspects including epidemiology, clinical features, diagnosis, treatment, social factors, and economics. We summarised all the articles in the WHO Database through an extractive summarizer followed by an exploration of the feature space using word embeddings which were then used to visualize the summarized associations of COVID-19 as found in the text. Clinicians, researchers, and policymakers will not only discover the direct effects of COVID-19 but also the systematic implications such as the anticipated rise in TB and cancer mortality due to the non-availability of drugs during the export lockdown as highlighted by our models. These demonstrate the utility of mining massive literature with natural language processing for rapid distillation and knowledge updates. This can help the users understand, synthesize, and take pre-emptive action with the available peer-reviewed evidence on COVID-19. Our models will be continuously updated with new literature and we have made our .

Around 200,000 confirmed cases with more than 100,000 deaths have been recorded [4] . Clinical presentation is diverse, evidence for effective drugs is scanty, vaccine development can take much longer and systemic implications of the pandemic are unclear. However, more than 14,000 research articles peer reviewed/ preprint are publicly available [5] which can aid fast-tracking of knowledge synthesis to address these gaps. WHO alone has collated a list of more than 5000 articles so far which is expected to increase over the coming weeks. Synthesizing knowledge from peer-reviewed literature is not easy for the consumers of this information, i.e. clinicians, researchers and policymakers.",

It can be anticipated that in the near future, the mortality and rate of complications arising from other diseases, treatment for which has been put on hold, may become as significant as the COVID-19 itself. Hence it is important to have an updated system for knowledge synthesis and evidence to guide clinical policy. Delay in detection and treatment of many conditions such as cancer and tuberculosis may have long term health and economic consequences that will become evident as the acute crisis settles down. Since it is humanly not possible to consider all aspects, evidence based insights and knowledge synthesis will be critical to guide the health systems towards recovery. However we did not find any study that evaluates the emerging systemic effects and the extent of collateral damage that COVID-19 incurs. Hence we carried out a study exploring the role of word-embedding models, text summarization and interactive dashboards in guiding policy.",

Words with similar context tend to have similar embeddings vectors thereby capturing the relationship between them while iterating through large corpus. Skip-gram algorithm [45] was used and the neural network was trained with one-hot encoded vectors to predict the target word with a fixed window size, iterating along the corpus. Softmax function in the last layer computed the probabilities, and the errors against actual class labels were used to update weights in the backpropagation.

Most of these sectors are currently scrambling to make better decisions in the light of evidence. While many countries have rolled out their plans over the next 12-18 months, the nature of the pandemic requires dynamic yet evidence-based decisions. Trends in peer-reviewed literature offer some degree of equipoise that is greater than daily news, hence knowledge synthesis from this line may prevent knee-jerk reactions in treatment and policy. A striking example of this dilemma has been the recommendation for Hydroxychloroquine that has gone from an optimistic to a negative narrative [46] . A similar controversy is currently emerging for the use of Remdesivir which sparked by the brief flashing of negative results on the WHO website which were then taken off. Such incidences indicate the extraordinary pressure to find evidence in the current circumstances. Our study is a small effort in plugging this gap by allowing human-in-the loop interaction with the published literature through the use of natural language processing, machine learning and visualization.",
