Due to the limitation of sample size, we cannot definitely conclude that fecal-261 oral transmission of COVID-19 does not exist. However, our data is consistent with the 262 previous reports from SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV publications which concluded that 263 despite long duration of viral RNA shedding, no infectious virus could be recovered from 264 the patients' feces (41, 42). 265 266 Intriguingly, the small intestinal fluids, which contain taurocholic acid sodium salt and 267 lecithin, important surfactant components of the bile, did not inactivate virus as expected 268 (Fig. 5A). In addition, we also observed that the virus titers did not drop in the presence 269 of 0.03% bovine bile (data not shown), the highest concentration that did not induce 270 cytotoxicity, contradicting the known fragility of lipid bilayers and sensitivity to bile salts 271 which serve as detergents in gut. Recent studies showed a heavy glycosylation of SARS-272 CoV-2 S protein (43) and it is possible the sugar coating conferred some stability against 273 the enzymatic digestion and bile salt solubilization. Two recent publications did 274 demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 has unique stability in the environment, at least in a 275 that are absent from small intestinal fluids function to potentially disrupt viral 277 lipid membranes in vivo. 278 279 Mechanistically, recent work from multiple groups showed a key role of TMPRSS2 in 280 cleaving SARS-CoV-2 S protein. Here, we provide data that besides TMPRSS2, 281TMPRSS4 also increases SARS-CoV-2 infectivity, at least in gut epithelial cells(Fig. 3-282 4). We observed an intriguing additive effect of the two enzymes, as both target single 283 arginine or lysine residues (R/K\u2193). One may speculate that this synergy stems from a 284 distinct subcellular localization in neighboring cells(Fig. 4A). Future work with 285 recombinant proteins and enzymatic digestion may help address whether S cleavage is 286 sequential and whether the two enzymes act on different sites on the S protein.287 288Finally, we observed strong syncytia formation in human enteroids(Fig. S2B-C). These 289 results may have great implications for virus cell-cell spread and evasion from antibody 290 neutralization (46).

Cells were classified as dividing or resting using a pooled 402 expression value for cell cycle genes (Satija Lab Website: regev_lab_cell_cycle_genes). 403 For UMAP and tSpace embeddings, cell cycle effects were removed by splitting the data 404 into dividing and resting cells and using the fastMNN function to align the dividing cells 405 with their resting counterparts. Dimensionality reduction was performed using the UMAP 406 algorithm and nearest neighbor alignments for trajectory inference and vascular modeling 407 were calculated using the tSpace algorithm.
