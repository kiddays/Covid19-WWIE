            "text": "India has recently started sequencing SARS-CoV2 genome from clinical isolates. Currently only few sequences are available from three states in India. Kerala was the first state to deposit complete sequence from two isolates followed by one from Gujarat. On April 27, 2020, the first five sequences from the state of West Bengal (Eastern India) were deposited on 'a global initiative on sharing avian flu data' (GISAID) platform. In this paper we have analysed the spike protein sequences from all these five isolates and also compared for their similarities or differences with other sequences reported in India and with isolates of Wuhan origin. We report one unique mutation at position 1124 in the S2 domain of spike protein of all the isolates from West Bengal only and one mutation downstream of the receptor binding domain at position 614 in S1 domain which was common with the sequence from Gujarat (a state of western part of India). Mutation in the S2 domain showed changes in the secondary structure of the spike protein at region of mutation. We also studied molecular dynamics using normal mode analyses and found that this mutation decreases the flexibility of S2 domain. Since both S1 and S2 are important in receptor binding followed by entry in the host cells, such mutations may define the affinity or avidity of receptor binding.",

            "text": "SARS-CoV2 (a member of Coronaviruses) outbreak occurred in Wuhan, China in the year 2019 and it became a pandemic recently that has affected countries worldwide. To design antiviral therapeutics/ vaccines it is important to understand the genetic sequence, structure and function of the viral proteins. When a virus tries to adapt to a new environment, in a new host, in a new geographical location and a new population, it would make changes in its genetic make up which in turn would bring in slight modifications in the viral proteins. Such variations would help the virus to utilize the host's machinery the best in favour of the virus survival and propagation. Since host's immune system eventually learns to identify a pathogen that had infected and starts producing protective antibodies, a virus often changes its structural proteins such that it can still infect the host cells escaping the host's immune system. Coronaviruses have been long known to undergo rapid mutations in its RNA genome. Such mutations get reflected in changes in the amino acid sequences of its structural and the nonstructural proteins.",

This trimer is made up of monomers consisting of S1 and S2 subunits. S1 subunit helps in attachment to the host cell receptor while S2 subunit helps in fusion to host cell and entry. Thus, spike protein has been an are of interest for designing vaccine and antiviral candidates against SARS-CoV2. Since the spike protein tends to mutate, it is important to obtain a broad mutation profile of this protein from extensive genome sequencing from different geographical locations of the world. Targeting areas of spike protein that do not undergo mutation i.e. conserved would be the key to design effective broad spectrum antiviral or vaccine.",

Change in vibrational entropy energy (\u0394\u0394SVib ENCoM) between the wild type Wuhan isolate and the West Bengal isolate was -4.445 kcal.mol -1 .K -1 (Figure 4 ). The \u0394\u0394G was 0.905 kcal/mol and the \u0394\u0394G ENCoM was 4.756 kcal/mol. All these suggested a stabilizing mutation in this type of spike.

Figure 6 shows the visual representations of the atomic fluctuation and deformation energies where positions that could be visibly detected t be different have been marked. This is the first report of mutations of such types in the isolates of the state of West Bengal and further sequencing followed by sequence analyses would help expanding the knowledge about variations of spike protein in human SARS-CoV. These variations might lead to virus diversification and eventual emergence of variants/ antibody escape mutants/strains/ serotypes. Also, mutations might help the virus to expand its tissue tropism and adjust with the host environment better. Therefore, elaborate studies on sequence variations should be done which would in turn help in better therapeutic targeting.",
