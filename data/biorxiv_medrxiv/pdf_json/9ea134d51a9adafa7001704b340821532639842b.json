In order to address this need, we have developed a highly sensitive RT-LAMP assay compatible with current reagents, that utilizes a colorimetric readout in as little as 30 minutes. In addition to this, we have developed an inexpensive pipeline to further increase sensitivity without requiring highly specialized equipment. A rapid inactivation protocol capable of inactivating virions, as well as endogenous nucleases, was also developed to increase sensitivity and sample stability. This protocol, combined with our RT-LAMP assay, has a sensitivity of at least 50 viral RNA copies per microliter in a sample. To further increase the sensitivity, a purification protocol compatible with this inactivation method was developed. The inactivation and purification protocol, combined with our RT-LAMP assay, brings the sensitivity to at least 1 viral RNA copy per microliter in a sample. We hope that this inactivation and purification pipeline, which costs approximately $0.07 per sample and which uses readily available reagents, will increase the availability of SARS-CoV-2 testing, as well as expand the settings in which this testing can be performed.",

As the disease spreads, the need for rapid point-of-care diagnostic tools has become immense. Many efforts are currently underway to develop such an assay that can be easily used in a variety of settings 1 . The ideal assay would require no specialized equipment and would have a rapid and easily read result. To that end, we have developed an assay based upon the reverse-transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) technique. To boost sensitivity, we also developed a novel sample preparation method that can be used as the first step for many different types of downstream assays. The protocol is simple, inexpensive, and rapid. It utilizes reagents that are readily prepared in large quantities.",

Utilizing a strand displacing polymerase and loops formed during this reaction, a fast amplification reaction can occur upon proper oligo binding to the desired target. Such reactions are capable of generating microgram quantities of DNA in a very short period of time at a single reaction temperature. Furthermore, although the stranddisplacing polymerase has reverse transcriptase activity, a reverse transcriptase can be included to improve sensitivity within the reaction when detecting an RNA target (RT-LAMP), such as the SARS-CoV-2 RNA. LAMP assays have a variety of readouts due to the large amount of DNA generated, including fluorescence using an intercalating DNA dye, turbidity, or by a drop in the pH if the reaction is minimally buffered 1, 3, 4 . This change in pH, sufficient to cause a pH indicator dye to visibly change color, is the most applicable method for a point-of-care LAMP-based diagnostic.",

In order to do this, we explored the tolerance of the RT-LAMP reaction to detergents and chaotropic salts that might aid in lysis of virions and purification of viral RNA genomes and mRNA. In addition, we optimized a very simple and rapid protocol for inactivating virions as well as endogenous RNAses in a way that allows at least 5 \u00b5l of sample (swabs in saline/PBS or straight saliva) to be added to a reaction and to bring sensitivity to 10-50 RNA copies per microliter of sample. We also developed a simple and rapid process by which viral RNA can be concentrated from as little as 0.5 ml of collection media such that, when used with the HMS Assay 1e, the limit of detection falls at least to 2 RNA copies per microliter. Unlike purification schemes used for the current FDA approved qRT-PCR-based test, this purification does not require a commercial kit or, for most sample types, a centrifuge. It binds nucleic acids to silica in the form of a suspension known as \"glass milk\" 6 , which is readily available in industrial quantities at little expense. The glass milk purification is completed in one or two tubes, one of which can be the same one in which the reaction is run. The RNA is kept in sodium iodide (NaI) or high ethanol solutions throughout. Both solutions inhibit RNAse activity, ensuring RNA stability. The glass milk preparation for millions of purifications can be made in an afternoon, with no need for specialized equipment or expensive reagents. The overall cost of the inactivation and purification is approximately $0.07 per sample.",

Furthermore, none of the reactions without viral RNA exhibited any amplification by 60 minutes. NEB Orf1a-C did not perform as well, as the time to amplification in the 200 RNA copy reactions was highly variable with many not amplifying until just before or after the 30-minute point. Furthermore, two reactions without viral RNA exhibited amplification, but we cannot rule out the possibility that these reactions, as sensitive as they are, were contaminated.

We first created a sample lysis buffer containing 4 M GuSCN and 2% TritonX100. We then added varying amounts of this buffer into HMS Assay 1e 25 \u00b5l colorimetric RT-LAMP reactions (NEB M1800) with 500 viral RNA copies, such that the final GuSCN concentration would range from 160 mM to 27 mM (i.e. a final dilution of 1:25 to 1:150 in the final reaction). All colorimetric reactions were run for 30 minutes at 65\uf0b0C. As Figure 5A shows, the reaction was visibly positive at GuSCN concentrations at or below 53 mM (1:75 dilution) although the 53 mM reaction was slightly more orange than the rest. To repeat this result, we ran eight replicates of the same reactions at 50 mM and 40 mM GuSCN (1:80, and 1:100 dilution, respectively, Figure 5B ), and all were robustly positive.

Other collection media, such as 0.9% saline, have less of an inhibitory effect, but the RNA in such media appears to degrade rapidly over the course of hours, reducing sensitivity if samples are not processed promptly. Finally, it is important to note that processing samples is not without risk, as such samples can contain infectious virus. Thus, we set out to design a protocol series that includes a rapid inactivation of virions in a variety of sample types while keeping the RNAse inactivated.

This protocol can also be completed with nothing more than this inactivation reagent and a boiling water source, allowing for rapid sample inactivation and stabilization in a wide variety of settings. The inactivation leaves a sample at a close to neutral pH with 2.5 mM TCEP and 1 mM EDTA, so such inactivated samples will likely be compatible with a variety of nucleic acid detection tests, not just RT-LAMP detection. We have also found dithiothreitol (DTT) can work in place of TCEP with a minor change in the sodium hydroxide (NaOH) used, as DTT is not as acidic as TCEP.

This suspension is made by cleaning small silicon dioxide particles and suspending them in an equal volume of water. A single lab can prepare enough for tens of millions of purifications in a day at a cost of less than $45 per 1 million purifications.
