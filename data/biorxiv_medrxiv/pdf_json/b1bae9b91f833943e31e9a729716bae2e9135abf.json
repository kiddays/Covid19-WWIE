The transfer learning from the Residual Network (RESNET-50) was leveraged for model development on CXR images from healthy individuals, bacterial and viral pneumonia, and COVID-19 positives patients. The performance metrics showed an accuracy of 99%, a recall valued of 99.8%, a precision of 99% and an F1 score of 99.8% for COVID-19 inference. The model was further successfully validated on CXR images from an independent repository. The implemented model was deployed with a web graphical user interface for inference (https://medicsinference.onrender.com ) for the medical research community; an associated cron job is scheduled to continue the learning process when novel and validated information becomes available.",

There is also a presence of small pleural effusions which is an abnormal fluid developed in the spaces around the lungs (Kampalath, 2020) . Thus there is presence of glass patterned areas, which affect both lungs even in the initial stages of the infection, in particular the lower lobes, and especially the posterior segments, with a fundamentally peripheral and subpleural distribution ( Figure 1 Currently, to detect and diagnose an infected individual upon clinical suspicion, or monitor the disease, a real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) test is done (CDC b, 2020) followed by chest radiographs (CXR) and/or computed tomography (CT) scans. rRT-PCR test results may take several hours or days and there is a pronounced shortage of RT-PCR tests kit, unlike the chest CXR which are routinely available with an instant outcome. Italian and British hospitals are beginning to employ CXR as a first-line triage tool due to long reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) turnaround times (Wong et al., 2020) . There is a growing interest in the use of CXR and CT scans for the screening, diagnosis and management of patients with suspected or known COVID-19",

The use of Convolutional Deep Neural Network (CDNN) allows for impressive discovery of patterns in medical image datasets, achieving image classification sometimes difficult for human experts ( Zhou et al., 2019) . The CDNN uses multiple processing layers to learn and represent data with multiple levels of abstraction by applying image analysis filters, or convolutions. The abstracted representation of images within each layer is constructed by convolving multiple filters across the image, producing a feature map that is used as input to the next layer. Thus with this architecture, the image pixels are used as input, then processed to generate the desired This study aimed at developing and deploying an inference model for rapid detection of COVID-19 using transfer learning and Machine vision on chest radiographs (CXR).",
