            "text": "COVID-19, caused by SARS-CoV-2, is an influenza-like disease with a respiratory route of transmission, yet clinical evidence suggests that the intestine may present another viral target organ. Indeed, the SARS-CoV-2 receptor angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is highly expressed on differentiated enterocytes. In human small intestinal organoids, enterocytes were readily infected by SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 as demonstrated by confocal-and electron-microscopy. Consequently, significant titers of infectious viral particles were measured. mRNA expression analysis revealed strong induction of a generic viral response program. We conclude that intestinal epithelium supports SARS-CoV-2 replication.",

Of note, SARS-CoV also readily infected enterocyte precursors (Fig. S3A -B) as shown previously (26, 27) . Some infected enterocyte progenitors were in mitosis (Fig. S3C) . While EEC-organoids produced appreciable titers, we never observed infection of Chromogranin-A+ EECs (Fig. S3D-E) . We also did not notice infection of Goblet cells across culture conditions. At 60 hours, apoptosis became prominent in both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 infected enterocytes (Fig. S5 ). ACE2 protein was readily revealed as a bright and ubiquitous brush border marker in hSIOs in DIF medium (Fig. 3C ). In hSIOs in EXP medium, ACE2 staining was much lower -yet still apical-in occasional cells in a subset of organoids that displayed a more mature morphology (Fig. 3C ). In immature (cystic) organoids within the same cultures, the ACE2 signal was below the detection threshold. Percentage of infected organoids under EXP and DIF conditions are given in Fig S4. Fig. S5 gives images and quantification of apoptotic cells upon infection.",

Infection with SARS-CoV-2 elicited a broad signature of cytokines and interferon stimulated genes (ISGs) attributed to type I and III interferon responses ( (29) , rotavirus (30) and enteroviruses (31, 32) . A recent study (33) describes an antiviral signature induced in human cell lines after SARS-CoV-2 infection. While the ISG response is broader in intestinal organoids, the induced gene sets are in close agreement between the two datasets ( Fig.  S8 ). One striking similarity was the low expression of Type I and III interferons: we only noticed a small induction of the Type III interferon IFNL1 in SARS-CoV-2 infected organoids. In SARS-CoV-infected organoids, we did not observe any type I or type III interferon induction. We confirmed these findings by ELISA on culture supernatant and qRT-PCR, which in addition to IFNL1 picked up low levels of type I interferon IFNB1 in SARS-CoV-2 but not in SARS-CoV infected organoids (Fig. S9) . The specific induction of IP-10/CXCL10 and ISG15 by SARS-CoV-2 was also confirmed by ELISA and qRT-PCR, respectively (Fig. S10 ). As in (33) , a short list of cytokine genes was induced by both viruses . CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International license (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder.

            "text": "This study shows that SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 infect enterocyte lineage cells in a human intestinal organoid model. It appears of interest that we see at least equal infection rates of enterocyte-precursors and enterocytes whereas ACE2 expression increases ~1000fold upon differentiation at the mRNA level (Fig. S2 ). This suggests that low levels of ACE2 may be sufficient for viral entry. The scale of the current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic suggests that this virus may continue to circulate in humans, causing yearly seasonal outbreaks. The fact that SARS-CoV-2 is the third highly pathogenic coronavirus (after SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV) to jump to humans within less than 20 years suggests that novel zoonotic coronavirus spillovers are likely to occur in the future. Despite this, limited information is available on coronavirus pathogenesis and transmission. This is in part due to the lack of in vitro cell models that accurately model host tissues. Very recently, it was already shown that human iPS cells differentiated towards a kidney fate support replication of SARS-CoV-2 (13). Our data imply that human organoids represent faithful experimental models to study the biology of coronaviruses.",

All patients were males that were operated for resection of an intestinal tumor. A sample from non-transformed, normal mucosa was taken for this study. The study was approved by the UMC Utrecht (Utrecht, The Netherlands) ethical committee and was in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and according to Dutch law. This study is compliant with all relevant ethical regulations regarding research involving human participants. Human small intestinal cells were isolated, processed and cultured as described previously (23, 25) . Instead of Wnt conditioned media, the medium was supplemented with Wnt surrogate (0,15 nM, U-Protein Express). This was termed expansion (EXP) medium. For differentiation towards EECs, organoids were treated with 1 \u00b5g/ml doxycycline (Sigma) in 'ENR' medium (Beumer et al., in press). General differentiation (termed DIF) was achieved in 'ENR'. BMP activation was achieved by withdrawing Noggin from 'ENR' and addition of BMP-2 (Peprotech, 50 ng/ml) and BMP-4 (Peprotech, 50 ng/ml) (termed DIF+BMP).",

The Medical Ethical Committee of the Erasmus MC Rotterdam granted permission for this study (METC 2012-512). Isolation of human bronchial airway stem cells was performed using a protocol adapted from Sachs and colleagues (2019). Bronchial tissues of adult lungs were cut into ~4mm sections, washed in Advanced DMEM supplemented with GlutaMax (Thermo Fisher), HEPES, penicillin (10,000 IU/mL) and streptomycin (10,000 IU/mL) (AdDF+++), and incubated with dispase (Corning) mixed with airway organoid (AO) medium (34) at a 1:1 ratio for 1 hour at 37\u00b0C. The digested tissue suspension was sequentially sheared using 10-and 5-ml plastic and flamed glass Pasteur pipettes. After shearing and filtering, lung cell pellets were then resuspended in 200 \u03bcL of growth factor reduced Matrigel (Corning) and plated in ~30 \u03bcL droplets in a 48 well tissue culture plate. Plates were placed at 37 degrees Celsius with 5% CO2 for 20 min to solidify the Matrigel droplets upon which 250uL of media was added to each well. Plates were incubated under standard tissue culture c To obtain differentiated organoid-derived cultures, organoids were dissociated into single cells using TrypLE express. Cells were seeded on Transwell membranes (Corning) coated with rat tail collagen type I (Fisher Scientific). Single cells were seeded in AO growth medium: complete base medium (CBM; Stemcell Pneumacult-ALI) at a 1:1 ratio. After 2-4 days, confluent monolayers were cultured at air-liquid interphase in CBM.

In brief: Total RNA was extracted using the standard TRIzol (Invitrogen) protocol and used for library preparation and sequencing. mRNA was processed as described previously, following an adapted version of the single-cell mRNA seq protocol of CEL-Seq (37, 38) . In brief, samples were barcoded with CEL-seq primers during a reverse transcription and pooled after second strand synthesis. The resulting cDNA was amplified with an overnight In vitro transcription reaction. From this amplified RNA, sequencing libraries were prepared with Illumina Truseq small RNA primers. Paired-end sequencing was performed on the Illumina Nextseq500 platform using barcoded 1 x 75 nt read setup. Read 1 was used to identify the Illumina library index and CEL-Seq sample barcode. Read 2 was aligned to the CRCh38 human RefSeq transcriptome, with the addition of SARS-CoV1 (HKU-39849) and SARS-CoV-2 (Ref-SKU: 026V-03883) genomes, using BWA using standard settings (39) . Reads that mapped equally well to multiple locations were discarded. Mapping and generation of count tables was done using the MapAndGo script. Samples were normalized using RPM normalization. Differential gene expression analysis was performed using the DESeq2 package (40). SARSmapping reads were removed before analyzing the different datasets. After filtering for an adjusted p-value < 0.05, the row z-score for the 25 genes with the highest upregulation after 60 hours of exposure to SARS-CoV-2 was calculated.

SARS-CoV (isolate HKU 39849, accession no. AY278491) and SARS-CoV-2 (isolate BetaCoV/Munich/BavPat1/2020; European Virus Archive Global #026V-03883; kindly provided by Dr. C. Drosten) were propagated on Vero E6 (ATCC\u00ae CRL 1586\u2122) cells in Opti-MEM I (1X) + GlutaMAX (Gibco), supplemented with penicillin (10,000 IU/mL) and streptomycin (10,000 IU/mL) at 37\u00b0C in a humidified CO2 incubator. The SARS-CoV-2 isolate was obtained from a clinical case in Germany, diagnosed after returning from China. Stocks were produced by infecting Vero E6 cells at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.01 and incubating the cells for 72 hours. The culture supernatant was cleared by centrifugation and stored in aliquots at \u221280\u00b0C. Stock titers were determined by preparing 10-fold serial dilutions in Opti-MEM I (1X) + GlutaMAX. Aliquots of each dilution were added to monolayes of 2 \u00d7 104 Vero E6 cells in the same medium in a 96-well plate. Twenty-four replicates were performed per virus stock. Plates were incubated at 37\u00b0C for 5 days and then examined for cytopathic effect. The TCID50 was calculated according to the method of Spearman & K\u00e4rber.
