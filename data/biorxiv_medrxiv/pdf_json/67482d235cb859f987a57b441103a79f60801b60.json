The World Health Organization (WHO) declared a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) on January 30 th and a worldwide pandemic on March 11 th 2020. In England, the first cases were identified in two tourists visiting York on January 29 th , on January 30 th a public health information campaign was launched to advise people on how to slow the spread of the virus, the first transmission was confirmed February 28 th , and a rapid increase in infections followed in the beginning of March, raising the UK risk level from moderate to high on March 12 th . 3 On March 18 th , schools in the UK were ordered to close, and on March 20 th restaurants, pubs, clubs, and indoor sport and leisure facilities also had to close their doors. As of April 18 th , England had 95,297 reported Covid-19 cases and 15,464 reported Covid-19 related deaths.",

            "text": "There is much variation in the severity of Covid-19 symptoms, ranging from asymptomatic to mild flu-like symptoms to critical illness. The severity of the symptoms and the mortality rate are strongly associated with age, sex, and underlying health problems. It is not yet clear to which extent genetic susceptibility plays a role in the individual differences in Covid-19 symptoms. It is well-established however that the underlying health problems that are associated with Covid-19 symptom severity, such as obesity, diabetes, and cardiovascular disorders, are heritable complex traits that are caused by a combination of many genes with small effects and environmental influences. 4 Identifying which genes are associated with Covid-19 outcomes is of great importance, as genetics are likely to play a role in individual differences in the susceptibility for infectious diseases in general, 5 and drug targets with support from genetic association studies are more than twice as likely to succeed. 6, 7 An international effort to investigate the role of genetic susceptibility for Covid-19 is on the way, 8 with UK Biobank 9 as one of the contributing cohorts. Individual-level Covid-19 test results from UK Biobank participants are still ongoing and are not part of the current study; instead, here we use the genotype data and geographic location of UK Biobank participants and link those to the total number of regional Covid-19 cases as reported by Public Health England (PHE) 10 . As one of the largest genotyped datasets in the world with a rich collection of phenotypic measurements (N ~500,000), 9 UK Biobank is likely to be contributing a substantial part of the polygenic signal for Covid-19 susceptibility. It is therefore important that the possible sources of polygenic signal in datasets like these are well characterized.",

Since this study uses regional reports of Covid-19 cases instead of individual-level Covid-19 outcomes, we expect to have more power to detect regional genetic correlates of social stratification if they are in line with Covid-19 outcomes and less power to detect strong polygenic signals directly related to the genetic susceptibility of Covid-19. If regional patterns of social stratification lead to associations between regional Covid-19 outcomes and genetic variants, these should be accounted for when the aim is to identify genes related to Covid-19 susceptibility in order to better understand the disease and accelerate drug target and vaccine developments.",

The RGWASs were run on 396,042 UK Biobank 9 participants of European descent on 1,246,531 common single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with minor allele frequencies (MAF) > .01. In an RGWAS, all subject get assigned the same phenotype as the rest of the subjects in their region. The phenotypes were defined as 1) the regional daily cumulative number of reported Covid-19 cases, and 2) the regional daily cumulative number of reported Covid-19 cases divided by the regional adult population size according to 2018 census data (case-rate). Regional data on the number of cases were available for 151 local authority regions in England obtained from Public Health England (PHE) 10 and regional data on the population sizes for 149 out of the 151 regions were obtained from the Office of National Statistics (ONS) 14 . All RGWASs were run using the linear-mixed model approach in fastGWA. 15 To control for confounding due to population stratification and family-relatedness, we corrected for a sparse genetic-relatedness matrix (GRM) and the first 100 principal components (PCs) and applied an LDSC-intercept based genomic control (GC). 11 We then computed the SNP-based heritability and the genetic correlation with educational attainment (EA), based on the EA3 GWAS 16 excluding all British cohorts (N=245,612, SNPbased heritability = .10), using LD Score regression 17, 18 .

The r g with educational attainment showed a similar trajectory as the SNP-based heritability with respect to its significance (bottom panel of Figure 1 ). The point estimate of the r g showed less variability and was .73 on March 13 th . In April, it started to decrease, reaching .14 on April 18 th . The standard error increased when the SNP-based heritability decreased, likely due to a weaker genetic signal. The high r g with educational attainment is in line with the regional differences in polygenic signals associated with educational attainment that we recently observed for other regional measures of SES, health, and cultural outcomes as well. 11 For the RGWAS results of March 13 th , we investigated the genetic correlations with a total of 10 traits, of which 5 traits are related to socio-economic status, and 5 traits are associated with health outcomes that are considered risk factors for worse Covid-19 outcomes ( Figure 2C ). All genetic correlations were significant after Bonferroni correction, except for Type-2 Diabetes. The genetic correlations were all in the direction that would be expected given a positive association with higher SES 11 , namely higher reported Covid-19 case-rates are in line with higher cognitive abilities, higher income, and better health outcomes (lower BMI, body fat, and cardiovascular risk, and higher selfrated health).

The strength of this genetic signal increased after controlling for population density by dividing the total number of regional cases by the regional population size. The positive genetic relationship between number of cases and higher SES and health increases in the beginning of the outbreak and then decreases as the number of cases rapidly rises and the disease spreads across the country. These results could reflect that 1) higher SES regions are more likely to have international travellers, including tourists, 2) people in higher SES regions are more likely to have higher levels of social contacts, or that 3) higher SES regions were more likely to have better testing capacities in the beginning of the pandemic. These genetic signals are in the other direction than one would expect based on epidemiological data on risk factors for more severe Covid-19 symptoms, 12, 13 which could supress genetic signals of interest when looking for polygenic signals associated with increased Covid-19 susceptibility.",

The same limitations that were described in the last implementation of the RGWAS approach remain 11 , including the ascertainment bias in the UK Biobank towards a more healthy and higher educated population and the unknown bias in the regional data (in this case, the bias in the regional data may be related to testing capacity and/or hospital access), and gene-environment correlations inflating genetic signals.",

Assignments for European, African, East-Asian, and South-Asian ancestries were based on > 0.9 posterior-probability of belonging to the 1000 Genomes reference cluster, with the remaining participants classified as Admixed. Posterior-probabilities were calculated under a bivariate Gaussian distribution where this approach generalizes the k-means method to take account of the shape of the reference cluster. We used a uniform prior and calculated the vectors of means and 2x2 variance-covariance matrices for each super-population. A total of 456,064 subjects were identified to have a European ancestry. A PCA was then conducted on the individuals of European ancestry (N = 456,064) in order to capture ancestry differences within the British population (see Figure 3 ).
