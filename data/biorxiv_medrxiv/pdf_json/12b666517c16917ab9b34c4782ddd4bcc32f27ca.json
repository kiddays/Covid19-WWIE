Our classification of included articles was not exclusively based on the labels assigned to these articles, because study designs are often mislabeled by the authors themselves. 4 We therefore first assessed the validity of such labeling by evaluating the study design in the full-text, before making our final classifications of a study. Primary articles were divided in five categories, i.e., human medical research, in silico, in vitro, animal research and human non-medical research, and then in subcategories ( Table 1) .

Identifying human medical research studies slows down the evidence-based decision making process, because a large bulk of literature has to be filtered out first. This selection process is particularly time consuming, because it can often not be done by reading titles and abstracts alone. Third, all except one (339/340) of the human medical research studies were observational studies or case reports. This implies that policy makers have to rely predominantly on studies that get a low-certainty (or quality) rating according to the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation) approach. 7 Fourth, about half of all included articles originated in China, i.e., 50.5% (588/1165). A high prevalence of articles from China was expected because the COVID-19 outbreak started in that country, but this statistic is disproportionate with the much higher COVID-19 infection and death rates in other countries.

Such research could explore (1) our statistics at later time points (2) quality assessments of the conduct and reporting of research studies on COVID-19 (3) factors that could be implemented to control the quantity and quality of publications (4) the impact of the development of a vaccine for COVID-19 on the publication curve and (5) how to rapidly synthesize literature in times of a pandemic. Further, high quality systematic reviews and guidelines for the prevention and management are necessary when COVID-19 is contained. This will be key to control new outbreaks of COVID-19 and other diseases. CONCLUSIONS We showed that as compared to the most recent pandemic (2009 H1N1), there is an overwhelming amount of information published on COVID-19. Due to the large body of nonoriginal research data (50%) published in the early phases of the pandemic, the original information published has been diluted. Also, a negligible number of published articles reported limitations in the abstracts, potentially facilitating overemphasis of the article findings or recommendations. Researchers, peer reviewer, and editors, should take action to level the publication curve and start labeling non-original research articles as secondary articles.",
