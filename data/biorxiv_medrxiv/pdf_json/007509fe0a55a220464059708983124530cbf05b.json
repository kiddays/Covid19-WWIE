Since the beginning of the outbreak, the efficiency of nucleic acid testing has been dependent on several rate-limiting factors, including availability and quantity of the testing kits in the affected area. More importantly, the quality, stability and reproducibility of the detection kits are questionable. The impact of methodology, disease stages, specimen collection methods, nucleic acid extraction methods, and the amplification system are all determinant factors for the accuracy of test results.Conservative estimates of the detection rate of nucleic acid are low (between ], and tests need to be repeated several times in many cases 102 before they can be confirmed.Radiological imaging is also a major diagnostic tool for COVID-19. The104 majority of COVID-19 cases have similar features on CT images including ground-glass opacities in the early stage and pulmonary consolidation in the 106 late stage. There is also sometimes a rounded morphology and a peripheral lung distribution [6,10]. Although typical CT images may help early screening 108 of suspected cases, the images of various viral pneumonias are similar and 109 they overlap with other infectious and inflammatory lung diseases. Therefore, it 110 is difficult for radiologists to distinguish COVID-19 from other viral pneumonias.

These findings have demonstrated the proof-of-principle that deep learning can extract CT image features of COVID-19 for diagnostic purposes. Using the supercomputer system, the time for each case takes only about 10 seconds, and it can be performed remotely via a shared public platform. Therefore, further developing this system can significantly shorten the diagnosis time for disease control. Our study represents the first study to apply artificial intelligence technologies to CT images for effectively screening for COVID-19.The gold standard for COVID-19 diagnosis has been nucleic acid based detection for the existence of specific sequences of the SARS-COV-2 gene.While we still value the importance of nucleic acid detection in the diagnosis of SARS-COV-2 infection, we must also note that the high number of false negatives due to several factors such as methodological disadvantages, disease stages, and methods for specimen collection might delay diagnosis and disease control. Recent data have suggested that the accuracy of nucleic acid testing is only about 30-50% [6,7,8]. Using CT imaging feature extraction, we are able to achieve above 89.5% accuracy, significantly outplaying nucleic acid testing. More interestingly, testing CT images from COVID-19 patients when initial pathogenic testing came negative, our model has achieved the accuracy of 85.2% for correctly predicting COVID-19.
