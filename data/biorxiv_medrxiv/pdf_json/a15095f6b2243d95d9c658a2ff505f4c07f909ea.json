If identified contacts are symptomatic when found, they are promptly isolated and treated in a healthcare setting. More often, contacts are found healthy, and may or may not be infected. Depending on how much time has passed since exposure to the primary infected individual, those infected may not yet be symptomatic -this period of time between infection and symptoms is an important epidemiological trait of an infectious disease called the incubation period. How to handle these symptom-free contacts is a recurring point of confusion and controversy, particularly for emerging infectious diseases. Two essential strategies are used: voluntary individual quarantine and voluntary active monitoring. Individual quarantine involves the separation from others of an individual who is believed to be exposed to the disease, but not currently showing symptoms of it; this requires private space, provision of essentials, and investment in enforcement. A less restrictive intervention, active monitoring, involves assessing the individual for symptoms at regular intervals either through twice-daily visits by healthcare workers or phone-based self-monitoring, 5 and, if symptoms are detected, promptly isolating the individual.",

Previous work has found that a disease's natural history, particularly the amount of transmission that occurs before symptom onset, greatly influences the ability to control outbreaks 6 and the relative effectiveness of individual quarantine vs. active monitoring. 7 Short-course diseases, such as influenza, and diseases with long periods of presymptomatic infectiousness, like hepatitis A, are impacted more strongly by quarantine than by active monitoring; however, quarantine is of limited benefit over active monitoring for the coronaviruses MERS and SARS, where persons usually show distinctive symptoms at or near the same time that they become infectious. Recent work on isolation for COVID-19 found a potentially large impact of perfect isolation, if one assumed there was limited presymptomatic transmission and a high probability of tracing contacts to be put under isolation immediately following symptom onset. 8 A recent proposal of a contact tracing mobile phone App could allow for this instant contact tracing, decreasing the time to isolation for symptomatic contacts. 9 Our framework enables comparison of active monitoring and individual quarantine and considers parameters such as delays, and imperfect isolation to account for known transmission of this respiratory virus after isolation in a healthcare setting. 10 One of the key uncertainties surrounding COVID-19 is the extent of asymptomatic and presymptomatic transmission.

There has also been uncertainty about the serial interval -the time between symptom onset of infectorinfectee pairs -which in turn reflects uncertainty about the extent of presymptomatic transmission. Early estimates by Nishiura et al 13 and Li et al 14 were derived from limited data (24 and 6 infector-infectee pairs, respectively) and in the latter case largely reflected the prior distribution derived from SARS cases in 2003. Given the severe impact of quarantine on both resources and individual liberty, it is vital to assess under what conditions quarantine can effectively control COVID-19, and among these under what conditions it is substantially more effective than less restrictive approaches such as active monitoring, particularly given uncertainty in essential disease parameters. Here, using methods described in previous work 7 and the latest epidemiological parameters reported for COVID-19 13,14 , we compare the ability of individual quarantine and active monitoring to reduce the effective reproductive number ( \" ) of COVID-19 to below the critical threshold of one. While mass restrictions on movements within cities have been implemented during this outbreak and are sometimes referred to as quarantines, here we focus on the effectiveness of quarantine and active monitoring on an individual basis based on contact tracing.",

Under our fitted disease natural history parameters for serial interval scenario 1, with a shorter mean serial interval and hence substantial presymptomatic infectiousness, individual quarantine was considerably more effective than active monitoring at reducing onward transmission by an infected contact. To offset this relative benefit of individual quarantine compared to active monitoring, perverse incentives to avoid quarantine would have to be correspondingly larger. Both scenarios were fit using an incubation period with mean = 5.2 days among 451 lab-confirmed cases from Wuhan; 14 other recent estimates of the incubation period of COVID-19 include a mean of 6.4 days among 88 travelers 24 and a median of 4 days among 291 hospitalized study patients. 25 A shorter incubation period relative to the serial interval would be consistent with less presymptomatic transmission. On the other hand, a recent study of cases in China and Singapore found longer average incubation periods (7.1 and 9 days) and shorter serial intervals (4.6 and 4.2), 26 which indicate an even higher proportion of presymptomatic transmission. In a scenario with these parameters, the relative benefit of individual quarantine vs. active monitoring would increase, while the total number of simulations where control is achieved under individual quarantine would decrease. The incubation period distribution, in addition to the serial interval distribution, is thus a key parameter to refine as additional information becomes available.",

The incremental benefit of individual quarantine over active monitoring was minimal in this scenario, requiring hundreds or thousands of suspected contacts to be quarantined to avert one infection beyond active monitoring alone. These results suggest that with a serial interval similar to that of SARS for COVID-19, there are very few plausible conditions under which individual quarantine would offer a sufficient advantage over active monitoring to justify the substantial incremental resources required to implement individual quarantine and large incremental costs to those experiencing it. Furthermore, if the more restrictive policy of individual quarantine instead of active monitoring leads to a decrease in the percent of contacts traced, through hesitance to name contacts or avoidance of contact .

If the epidemic continues to grow, however, the feasibility and social acceptability of quarantining individuals becomes a crucial consideration. In these circumstances, complementary interventions such as social distancing and pharmaceutical interventions may be needed if efficient contact tracing and rapid isolation are not readily achievable, regardless of the extent of presymptomatic transmission. Furthermore, since contact tracing would be unable to identify contacts infected by individuals who never develop symptoms (ie, asymptomatic infectiousness rather than presymptomatic infectiousness), community interventions like social distancing are suited for mitigating transmission by asymptomatic infection while interventions targeted by contact tracing can address those exposed to individuals known to have the disease. Even if only a small proportion of infected contacts are traced, the potential transmission chains from those contacts could be prevented. The extent to which it is worth investing in imperfect contact tracing will depend on the rate of epidemic growth, which affects feasibility, and the other mix of interventions being considered.",

The model fitting procedure is tuned to accept a wide range of inputs consistent with the published dynamics without overfitting -thereby allowing for built-in uncertainty of input values. Additional limitations of the model include the focus on early epidemic growth in the absence of depletion of susceptibles, the assumption of consistent # across scenarios with different serial intervals. By assuming relative infectiousness follows a triangular distribution, we may underestimate the impact of contact-tracing interventions if relative infectiousness increases exponentially towards the end of disease instead, or overestimate the impact of relative infectious decreases exponentially after the earliest stages; however, our estimate of peak infectiousness at 38% of the duration of infectiousness suggests peak infectivity at neither end of the duration of infectiousness. By assuming the duration of infectiousness follows a uniform distribution, we may exclude longduration shedders, which can lead to either an underestimation of the effect size, if a larger fraction of an individual's infections happen long after isolation, or an overestimation of the effect size, if the right tail is long enough such that individuals are released from interventions and able to spark a second outbreak. In addition, our choice to consider shifts of the latent period relative to the infectious period implicitly assumes a similar shape to the underlying distributions, albeit with different means. As the amount of presymptomatic transmission will depend not only on the average timing of latent period relative to the incubation period, but also on the standard deviation of these distributions, more data on their true shapes is urgently needed.",

In our model framework, self-isolation can be conceptualized as a scenario where all contacts are traced and under active monitoring, since recognition of symptom onset is the event that triggers isolation. Mass quarantine is expected to result in prompt isolation upon symptom onset of any truly infected individuals, but the impact of this strategy on COVID-19 will depend heavily on whether presymptomatic exposure within the group is decreased or increased by the approach to confinement. That is, mass quarantine may reduce or increase the number of uninfected contacts exposed to presymptomatic infectiousness of those who do go on to develop the disease. In serial interval scenario 1, where a mean of 20% of transmission is expected to occur before symptom onset, the positive effect of prompt isolation can be offset by an increase in presymptomatic transmission in a confined space. Mass quarantines can also result in unintended consequences that can exacerbate transmission of COVID-19 such as avoidance of contact tracers and inaccurate recall, or other infectious diseases more broadly, such as a reduction in healthcare worker support, availability of supplies, or high-density settings. 26 The impact of travel restrictions on human mobility, a necessary first step in the causal chain to outbreak containment, is difficult to measure, but the impact has been documented in Sierra Leone during the 2014-2016 epidemic of Ebola Virus Disease. 27",

We identified several studies reporting estimates of epidemiologic parameters of COVID-19, as well as others focused on measures to control the COVID-19 outbreak. However, few focused specifically on contact-based measures. Recent work on isolation for the 2019 Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) found a potentially large impact of perfect isolation, if one assumed there was limited pre-symptomatic transmission and a high probability of tracing contacts to be put under isolation immediately following symptom onset.

However, using a SARS-like serial interval of mean 7.5 days, individual quarantine and active monitoring are similarly effective at controlling onward transmission in a high feasibility setting. The burden of placing uninfected contacts under individual quarantine can grow untenable due to a longer duration in quarantine before clearance (assumed 14 days) and a high ratio of uninfected contacts traced per truly infected contact. In such settings, resources may be prioritized for broader social distancing measures, and active monitoring or individual quarantine of high-risk contacts can contribute synergistically. The sensitivity of these results to the estimated serial interval highlights the urgent need for better data to guide policy decisions.",

An offset of -2 days indicates infectiousness precedes symptoms by 2 days, an offset of 0 days indicates onset of both simultaneously, and an offset of 1 day indicates infectiousness onset occurs 1 day after symptom onset.
