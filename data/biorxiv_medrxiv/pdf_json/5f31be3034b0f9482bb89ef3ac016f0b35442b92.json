            "text": "One of the more widely advocated solutions to slowing down the spread of COVID-19 has been automated contact tracing. Since proximity data can be collected by personal mobile devices, the natural proposal has been to use this for contact tracing as this provides a major gain over a manual implementation. In this work, we study the characteristics of automated contact tracing and its effectiveness for mapping the spread of a pandemic due to the spread of SARS-CoV-2. We highlight the infrastructure and social structures required for automated contact tracing to work for the current pandemic. We display the vulnerabilities of the strategy to inadequately sample the population, which results in the inability to sufficiently determine significant contact with infected individuals. Of crucial importance will be the participation of a significant fraction of the population for which we derive a minimum threshold. We conclude that a strong reliance on contact tracing to contain the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic can lead to the potential danger of allowing the pandemic to spread unchecked. A carefully thought out strategy for controlling the spread of the pandemic along with automated contact tracing can lead to an optimal solution. 1 One study suggested that MERS-CoV can be transmitted before the onset of symptoms [12] .",

Recent projections propose surveillance for the next few years [1] , with several measures that will need to be put in place to minimize the cost of the pandemic to humankind.

Extensive studies of manual contact tracing were done during the previous outbreak of the Ebola virus [3] [4] [5] , SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV [6] . More recently, mathematical models have been formulated to study contact tracing assuming the disease spread to be quantifiable by the SIR model [7] . However, there are reasons for us to believe that the effectiveness of automated contact tracing during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic requires a more detailed examination given the distinct difference in the prevalence of this pandemic from the ones in the recent past and the different modes of transmission of the pathogen.",

The dispersion parameter is estimated to also be similar to that of SARS-CoV (close to 0.1), which could be causing superspreading [26, [29] [30] [31] . While, theoretically, contact tracing can be shown as an effective means of containing SARS-CoV-2 [30] , factors such as long delays from symptom onset to isolation, fewer cases ascertained by contact tracing, and increasing pre-symptomatic transmission can significantly impact how effective contact tracing will be in practice. Defining significant contact as being within 2 meters and lasting for at least 15 minutes can result in the detection of more than 4 out of 5 infected cases but at the cost of tracing 36 contacts per individual (95 th percentile: 0 \u2212 182 contacts per individual) [32] . Changes to the definitions of the parameters can reduce the numbers traced. If the threshold of minimum contact time is increased to at least 4 hours of contact the spread of the pathogen cannot be controlled by automated contact tracing since many potentially infected contacts will escape detection. Detailed modeling of SARS-CoV-2 transmission shows that the pandemic can be sustained just by pre-symptomatic transmission and that contact tracing can be used to contain the spread of the pathogen if there are no significant delays to identifying and isolating infected individuals and their contacts [33] .",

The infected individuals can spread the disease to their contacts before they are isolated and to medical workers after they are isolated with varying probabilities. Of significance here is that after the initial period of ignorance of the population about a rising pandemic, infected individuals will be isolated with higher efficiency (even with manual contact tracing) resulting in the curtailment of the spread of the pathogen. How is contact tracing more effective in such diseases? Since the mobility of the infected individual usually sees a decline after the onset of symptoms, the number of contacts at risk become limited to nearest neighbours and possibly next-to-nearest neighbors in the contact space. This allows the implementation of a manual contact tracing algorithm that identifies these neighbours and isolates or tests them as suggested by [8] . This was seen to be effective during the Ebola, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV outbreaks.",

Assuming p t to be large will lead to an unreasonably large estimate of the number of potential contacts in a crowded region like supermarkets, which remain open during the period of social distancing. On the other hand, assuming p t to be small will underestimate the number of infected contacts, especially because there might be other modes of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 that are not being considered.

Temporally, the cross-sections have to overlap for a time t 0 which is the threshold interaction time that is critical for an individual to infect another by proximity. For the sake of simplicity and without any loss of generality of our argument we can assume that the probability of getting infected, p t , is independent of the degree of overlap of the cross-sections and for any time t > t 0 . Figure 1 gives a depiction of what the individuals in this model might look like. In the left-most panel, B and C are in contact with A at t = 0 but not with each other. D is isolated from all of them. After a period of time t < t 0 , B is isolated but C stays in contact with A. Then at time t = t 0 + \u03b5, where \u03b5 t 0 , we see that C is still in contact with A, B remains isolated and E has come in contact with both A and C. Using the methods of contact tracing, if A reports sick at a future time, C will be deemed as having had significant contact with A. E might also be deemed as such depending on how long he maintains proximity with A, but the proximity of E with C need not be counted even if E spends t > t 0 in contact with C (if only primary contacts are traced) unless C reports sick too.",

We see that \u03b7 drops to 64% when f e = 0.8 f min e and 25% when f e = 0.5 f min e . This non-linearity exists because f e not only reduces the number of sick individuals who can report their status but also the number of individuals who can receive a notification that they have come in contact with a sick person. This is the key difference between manual contact tracing where all contacts are looked up and traced 4 when compared with automated contact tracing where the process is driven by voluntary participation. Furthermore, as seen in figure 2 , when the percentage of sick individuals who report that they are sick, f c , is lower than 100%, contact tracing becomes even less effective. In addition, the percentage of cases that can actually be detected, r c , will realistically be less than 100% for SARS-CoV-2 because of the prevalence of subclinical cases that will escape detection.",

Even a day or two of delays can increase f T making contact tracing ineffective [33] . \u2022 Variations in p t can be caused by several factors some of which are controllable. Since p t depends on the contagiousness of the disease and any protective measures taken against the spread of the infection, p t can be reduced by measures of limited social distancing, the use of PPE and raising public awareness about the contagiousness of COVID-19. This can pose a significant challenge in densely populated regions and regions with poor living conditions and might lead to the breakdown of the applicability of automated contact tracing. \u2022 f c is somewhat more difficult to control assuming the reporting of those who are confirmed sick is voluntary. This can only be increased by increasing the population's willingness to contribute to contact tracing. \u2022 r c is the parameter that is least under control since without very large-scale testing, asymptomatic and mildly symptomatic cases will be difficult to find. This is especially true if the infection can spread by means other than proximity alone as might be the case for SARS-CoV-2 [15, 18, 19 ].",
