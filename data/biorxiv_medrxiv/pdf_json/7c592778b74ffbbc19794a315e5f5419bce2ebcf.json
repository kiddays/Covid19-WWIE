At cellular level, virus infection initiates with binding of viral particles to the host surface cellular receptor angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). SARS-CoV-2 engages ACE2 as the entry receptor and employs the cellular serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2) for S protein priming. TMPRSS2 activity is essential for viral spread and pathogenesis in the infected host. Understanding how TMPRSS2 protein expression in the lung varies in the population could reveal important insights into differential susceptibility to influenza and coronavirus infections. Here, we systematically analyzed coding-region variants in TMPRSS2 and the eQTL variants, which may affect the gene expression, to compare the genomic characteristics of TMPRSS2 among different populations. Our findings suggest that the lung-specific eQTL variants may confer different susceptibility or response to SARS-CoV-2 infection from different populations under the similar conditions. In particular, we found that the eQTL variant rs35074065 is associated with high expression of TMPRSS2 but with a low expression of the interferon (IFN)-\u03b1/\u03b2-inducible gene, MX1, splicing isoform. Thus, these subjects could account for a more susceptibility either to viral infection or to a decrease in cellular antiviral response.",

Recently, human angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) was reported as an entry receptor for SARS-CoV-2. 3 Moreover, the spike (S) protein of coronaviruses facilitates viral entry into target cells. Entry depends on binding of the surface unit, S1, of the S protein to a cellular receptor, which facilitates viral attachment to the surface of target cells. SARS-CoV-2 engages ACE2 as the entry receptor and employs the cellular serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2) for S protein priming. 5 TMPRSS2 activity is essential for viral spread and pathogenesis in the infected host. 7-10 TMPRSS2 as a host cell factor is critical for spread of several clinically relevant viruses, including influenza A viruses and coronaviruses. 7,10,11-16 TMPRSS2 is a cell surface protein that is expressed by epithelial cells of specific tissues including those in the aerodigestive tract. It is dispensable for development and homeostasis and thus, constitutes an attractive drug target. 13 In this context, it is noteworthy that the serine protease inhibitor camostat mesylate, which blocks TMPRSS2 activity has been approved in Japan for human use, but for an unrelated indication. 10, 14 Due to the crucial role of TMPRSS2 in the viral infection, we analyzed its genetic landscape in different populations trying to find a possible genetic predisposition to SARS-CoV-2 infection.",

Immunohistochemical studies, with limited sample size, suggest that the TMPRSS2 protein is more heavily expressed in bronchial epithelial cells than in surfactant-producing type II alveolar cells and alveolar macrophages, and that there is no expression in type I alveolar cells that form the respiratory surface. 17 A recent single-cell RNA-sequencing study, confirmed that TMPRSS2 is expressed in type 1 d 2 alveolar cells. 18 Accordingly, our in-silico analysis supported the high TMPRSS2 gene expression in tissues of the respiratory tract, as bronchus, pharyngeal mucosa, and lung. Moreover, it is also considerable to study the genetic variants and the eQTL of this gene as cause of protein expression variability of TMPRSS2. For example, patients who carried single nucleotide polymorphisms associated with higher TMPRSS2 expression (rs2070788 and rs383510) were more susceptible to influenza virus infection A(H7N9) in two separate patient cohorts. 19 Our data on eQTL variants showed that the EAS population has much lower AFs in the eQTL lung-specific variants associated with higher TMPRSS2 expression in lung, while the European populations have higher AFs for the same variants. Interestingly, the top eQTL variants were in a genomic region that includes not only TMPRSS2 gene but also MX1 gene, which encodes a guanosine triphosphate (GTP)metabolizing protein that participates in the cellular antiviral response. MX1 is an interferon (IFN)-\u03b1/\u03b2-inducible gene that is widely recognized as an influenza susceptibility gene. 20 Of note, the downregulation of MX1 has been documented in non-responder patients to interferon-based antiviral therapy of chronic hepatitis C virus infection. 21 Our data demonstrated that subjects with the eQTL associated with high expression of TMPRSS2 could also carry the associated eQTL in the MX1 gene. In particular, we found that the eQTL variant rs35074065 is associated with high expression of TMPRSS2 but with a low expression of MX1 splicing isoform. Thus, these subjects could account for a more susceptibility either to viral infection or to a decrease in cellular antiviral response.",

Remarkably, at the mRNA level, constitutive expression of TMPRSS2 in lung tissue does not appear to differ between men and women. 16 Accordingly, TMPRSS2 gene expression data from GTEx database do not highlight any difference between male in female. There is a wide variation among both sexes in terms of mRNA expression levels. 16 Low levels of androgens present in women may suffice to sustain TMPRSS2 expression. In addition, TMPRSS2 (and tumors with the TMPRSS2:ERG fusion protein) may be responsive to estrogen signaling. 22,23 It is attractive to speculate that androgen receptorinhibitory therapies might reduce susceptibility to COVID-19 pulmonary symptoms and mortality.",

The benign variants were classified by using a combination of the three algorithms VEST3, REVEL, and RadialSVM and the pathogenic ones by other three algorithms MutationTaster, Mcap, and CADD as recently suggested. 15 The 26% (88/334) of non-synonymous variants has been classified as pathogenic. All these variants are located along the entire coding region of the gene (Figure 1a), and both missense pathogenic and LoF variants exhibit very low overall AFs (Figure 1b). This finding agrees with the recommended benign frequency cut-off of 0.0001 for TMPRSS2 gene, as derived from the Varsome database (https://varsome.com/). Nevertheless, the distribution of AFs across the different populations showed the highest percentage in African (AFR) population within LoF variant class. Similarly, Swedish population exhibited the highest AF for the LoF variants among the Europeans (Figure 1c). When we looked at non-synonymous pathogenic variants, we observed the highest AF among Ashkenazi Jewish (ASJ) individuals (Figure 1b), while Finnish (FIN) showed the highest AF among European subpopulations (Figure 1c). The AFs of non-synonymous variants classified as benign (198/334, 59.3%) were similarly distributed among the different populations (Figure 1b-c). The average AFs for all types of variants here investigated are summarized in",

Our findings suggested that no direct evidence was identified genetically supporting the existence of resistant variants for coronavirus S-protein priming in different populations. The effects of low-frequency missense pathogenic variants, as well as those of LoF variants for S-protein priming should be further investigated. The data of variant distribution and AFs may contribute to the further investigations of TMPRSS2, including its roles in acute lung injury and lung function. Of note, our findings suggest that the lung-specific eQTL variants may confer different susceptibility or response to SARS-CoV-2 infection from different populations under the similar conditions. In conclusion, to know the genetic variability of TMPRSS2 gene will be useful for both the prognosis and the treatment of the patients affected by COVID-19.",
