Its implementation has enabled to trace back the time of the most recent common ancestor (T MRCA ) of SARS-CoV-2 to late November 2019, (8) consistent with epidemiological findings that show viral local transmission in Wuhan by the middle December 2019. (9) Within this same framework, a recent analysis of SARS-CoV-2 genomes from 21 neighborhoods in New York city (NYC) revealed that the NYC epidemic has been mainly sourced from untracked transmission between the USA and Europe and also pointed that the virus was likely circulating in the city weeks before the first confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection case. (10) At the moment, however, it is challenging to estimate the onset date of local transmission clusters within countries (or cities) based solely on genetic data. Due to the short period of time since the beginning of the outbreak and to the uneven geographic sampling of SARS-CoV-2 genomes, in most cases, there's still not enough phylogenetic signal to define location-specific clusters.

The cumulative number of deaths could be a reliable tracker of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic's progress within a country. (12) The lack of testing and the great proportion of asymptomatic subjects profoundly restrain the capacity of most countries to count the true number of SARS-CoV-2 infections, while the smaller number of deaths is less prone to such degree of underestimation. Furthermore, the cumulative number of reported deaths represents a time-delayed tracker of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic and thus provides valuable information on early epidemic dynamics even when data is obtained after implementation of national control measures that reduce the viral spread. Current estimates support an infection fatality ratio of SARS-CoV-2 of around 1% and a median time between infection and death of around three weeks. (13) (14) To infer the probable onset date of the community spread of SARS-CoV-2 in a given location, we assumed that: a) as soon as the virus starts spreading locally, the epidemic starts to grow exponentially; b) the cumulative number of deaths starts to increase exponentially 20 days later than the beginning of the epidemic exponential growth; and c) the rate of exponential growth of the number of deaths remains roughly constant during the epidemic early weeks. For this study we selected China and those countries from Western Europe (Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, Netherlands, Spain, United Kingdom [UK]), North America (New York, USA) and South America (Brazil) that were most heavily affected until 5th April 2020. (3) To capture the early period of exponential growth of virus transmission, before national control measures were implemented, we set the start point to the day when the cumulative number of deaths was above one and then counted the cumulative number of deaths during the following three weeks. .

To validate our approach, we first estimated the beginning of community transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in locations with previous molecular clock estimates. Using our framework, we traced the onset date of community transmission of SARS-CoV-2 to early December 2019 in China and to early February 2020 in New York (Figure 1 and Table 1 ).

Our findings suggest that community transmission might have started around middle January 2020 in Italy and between late January and early February 2020 in the remaining countries (Figure 1 ). In some countries (Italy and Netherlands) community transmission was traced long before (2-4 weeks) the first confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection case; while in others (Spain, France, United Kingdom, Germany, and Belgium) the onset date roughly coincides with the time of detection of the first imported cases (Figure 1 ). In all countries analyzed, however, SARS-CoV-2 probably started to spread locally long before community transmission was officially recognized and control measures for social distancing and air travel restrictions were implemented (Table 1) . Of note, our estimation of the onset date of community transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in European countries is consistent with the estimated T MRCA of some European and European/American clades like the A1a (28 th January: 19 th January -17 th February) and the A2a (25 th January: 19 th January -2 nd February). (10) These results suggest that early community transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in Europe could have been fueled by the rapid dissemination of few regional clades.",

Finally, we plotted the projected number of total infected individuals on a logarithmic scale along time and performed a linear regression analysis to estimate the probable onset date of the SARS-CoV-2 community transmission as the X-intercept point of the analysis. Linear regression analyses were performed using Graph Pad v6 (Prism Software, La Jolla, California, USA).",
