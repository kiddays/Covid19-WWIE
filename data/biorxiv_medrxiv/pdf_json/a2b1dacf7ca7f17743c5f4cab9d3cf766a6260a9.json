COVID-19 daily data of mainland China excluding Hubei province, including the cumulative confirmed cases, the cumulative deaths, newly confirmed cases and the cumulative recovered cases for the period January 20th-March 3rd, 2020, were archived from the National Health Commission of China (NHCC). We parameterize the model by using the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method and estimate the control reproduction number R c , as well as the effective daily reproduction ratio R e (t), of the disease transmission in mainland China excluding Hubei province. Results: The estimation outcomes indicate that R c is 3.36 (95% CI 3.20-3.64) and R e (t) has dropped below 1 since January 31st, 2020, which implies that the containment strategies implemented by the Chinese government in mainland China excluding Hubei province are indeed effective and magnificently suppressed COVID-19 transmission. Moreover, our results show that relieving personal protection too early may lead to the spread of disease for a longer time and more people would be infected, and may even cause epidemic or outbreak again. By calculating the effective reproduction ratio, we prove that the contact rate should be kept at least less than 30% of the normal level by April, 2020.",

( [6] ) analyzed data on the first 425 confirmed cases in Wuhan and determined the epidemiologic characteristics of COVID-19. Based on their estimates, the mean incubation period was 5.2 days, and R 0 was 2.2, which is in line with the result estimated by Riou et al. ([7] ). Zhao et al. ( [8] ) assessed the unreported number of COVID-19 cases in China in the first half of January with the estimation of R 0 2.56. Considering the impact of the variations in disease reporting rate, Zhao et al. ( [9] ) modelled the epidemic curve of COVID-19 cases, in mainland China from January 10 to January 24, 2020, through the exponential growth and concluded that the mean R 0 ranged from 2.24 to 3.58 associated with 8-fold to 2-fold increase in the reporting rate. Li et al. ([10] ) conducted a mathematical modeling study using five independent methods to assess R 0 of COVID-19. Their results illustrated that R 0 dropped from 4.38 to 3.41 after the closure of Wuhan city. Over the entire epidemic period COVID-19 had a R 0 of 3.39. Moreover, Tang et al. formulated a deterministic compartmental model. Their estimations based on likelihood and model analysis showed that R 0 with control measures might be as high as 6.47 ( [5] ). Most recently, Chen et al. ( [11] ) developed a Bats-Hosts-Reservoir-People transmission network model to simulate the potential transmission from the infectious sources to human. The estimated values of R 0 were 2.30 from reservoir to person and 3.58 from person to person. We noticed that the estimations of R 0 in varied studies are different. As mentioned in [5, 12] , variability in the estimation of the basic reproduction number is a general recognized methodological issue, and standardized methods both for calculating and reporting R 0 are still missing. Furthermore, the value of R 0 may vary with key All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission.",

Assuming that the adjusting time is from March 5th, 2020, Figure 6 (a) and (b) illustrate that contact rate with 20% of the initial value c 0 will not cause the disease re-bounce. However, the epidemic period will be extended for about 40 days until early May and the cumulative number of confirmed cases will increase by around 0.5% to 13,227. While if the starting time of the adjusting is postponed to March 20th, the epidemic time of disease will be extended for about one week and the cumulative number of confirmed cases will increase by only around 0.05% to 13,161, compared with the scenario of no changes. Nevertheless, if the contact rate is half of the initial value, i.e. q 1 = 0.5 and R e (t) = 1.68, COVID-19 will re-bounce on a large scale in a short time frame, even if the starting time is postponed to March 20th.

The first one is the contact rate, c(t), which was assumed to be dependent on the cumulative number of confirmed cases to better quantify the varied interventions and self-protection measures. The other one is the contact tracing function, which was dependent on the number of new cases. We evaluated the impact of partial lifting control measures on COVID-19 transmission. Our results show that relieve self-protection too early may lead to the spread of the virus for a longer time and more people would be infected, and may even lead to the mass transmission of the virus again. The reduction of the emergency response level does not mean that people can be off guard. At least until the end of March, life will not be able to return to normal.",

It requires certain time from unknown to known. Therefore, the data accuracy in Wuhan, Hubei is a major issue for parameters' calibration.

The number of predicted recovered cases is less than the number of actual recovered individuals in the later period of data fitting. The possible reason is that the recovery rate of hospitalized individuals was increasing with the improvement of treatment level and the increase of medical resources. In addition, due to increased contact tracing efficiency, large quantity of mild symptomatic cases were detected and hospitalised which has higher recover rate than other classified cases. A time-dependent recovery rate may be more suitable to fit the real data. Furthermore, age is an key parameter determining the mortality and recover rates. It is ideal to set up age-structured agent-based or meta population-based deterministic models which can capture this important risk factor. In this work, the initial value of the susceptible class S(0) was set to be the population of mainland China excluding Hubei province. Actually, the number of susceptible individuals is not as many as this number considering the very strict control measures implemented and the difference of behaviors between different age groups. A proper method to estimate the accurate number of susceptible individuals should be studied in the future. Besides, the impact of limited medical resources is another important issue that is not incorporated in our model. The transmission dynamics of COVID-19 accounting for the potential negative effects of health systems being overwhelmed on mortality will be studied in our future work.",
