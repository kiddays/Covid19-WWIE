            "text": "The novel coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic poses a serious public health 33 risk. Analyzing the genome of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-34 CoV-2) from clinical samples is crucial for the understanding of viral spread and viral 35 evolution, as well as for vaccine development. Existing sample preparation methods for 36 viral genome sequencing are demanding on user technique and time, and thus not ideal 37 for time-sensitive clinical samples; these methods are also not optimized for high 38 performance on viral genomes. We have developed MetagenomIc RNA EnRichment 39 VirAl sequencing (MINERVA), a facile, practical, and robust approach for metagenomic 40 and deep viral sequencing from clinical samples. This approach uses direct tagmentation 41 of RNA/DNA hybrids using Tn5 transposase to greatly simplify the sequencing library 42 construction process, while subsequent targeted enrichment can generate viral genomes 43 with high sensitivity, coverage, and depth. We demonstrate the utility of MINERVA on 44 pharyngeal, sputum and stool samples collected from COVID-19 patients, successfully 45 obtaining both whole metatranscriptomes and complete high-depth high-coverage SARS-46 CoV-2 genomes from these clinical samples, with high yield and robustness. MINERVA 47 is compatible with clinical nucleic extracts containing carrier RNA. With a shortened 48 hands-on time from sample to virus-enriched sequencing-ready library, this rapid, 49 versatile, and clinic-friendly approach will facilitate monitoring of viral genetic variations 50 during outbreaks, both current and future.",

Samples Y1-Y6 were excluded from dsDL processing as 156 this processing strategy is incompatible with samples containing carrier RNA. On average, 157 we sequenced 1-3 Gbp for each MINERVA library pre-and post-enrichment, and nearly 158 100 Gbp for each dsDL library (Fig. 2B) .",

In both MINERVA and dsDL data, we detected low yet significant levels of 164 SARS-CoV-2 sequences. The viral ratio is between 10 -7 and 10 -1 . It is worth noting that 165 the SARS-CoV-2 sequence ratio is higher in MINERVA data than in dsDL data (Fig. 2C 166 and 2D), suggesting that MINERVA libraries capture more SARS-CoV-2 sequences. This 167 phenomenon was more prominent for low viral load samples. Though SARS-CoV-2 168 genome coverage and depth was not high in SHERRY results due to low viral ratio and 169 low sequencing depth, performing MINERVA subsequently can enrich the SARS-CoV-2 170 sequence ratio up to 10,000-fold ( Fig. 2E and S5) . As a result, MINERVA gives more 171 complete and deeper coverage of SARS-CoV-2 genomes ( Fig. 2F and 2G) , despite 172 sequencing dsDL libraries to two orders of magnitude more depth (Fig. 2B) . We achieved 173 even higher quality of MINERVA data by scaling up the reaction volume (Fig. S5) . Using 174 the same samples and the same amount of sequencing data, more input in a higher 175 reaction volume resulted in deeper SARS-CoV-2 genome coverage. 176 177 .

Therefore, most RT-qPCR showed the biggest improvement over dsDL for stool samples (Fig. 2H) , which prompted 194 us to investigate these samples further. By assessing the relative compositions of 195 bacterial species and viral species in each sample type, we noted that the bacteria largely 196 account for the difference between stool samples and the other two samples types, not 197 viruses ( Fig. 3A and S6 ). This is likely due to the unique relationship between the 198 microbiome and its environment, subject to host-specific variations. In the stool samples, (Fig. 3B) .

Recent 216 studies have identified genetic variations and raised the possibility that multiple variants 217 could co-exist in the same host individual. We evaluated the performance of MINERVA in 218 detecting SARS-CoV-2 genetic variations. Aided by deep coverage of the viral genome 219 (Fig. 3E), MINERVA detects genetic variations more effectively than dsDL. Using 85 220 samples, we constructed a SARS-CoV-2 mutational profile (Fig. 3E), which was distinct 221 from the Guangdong profile(8). A few mutation sites, including the two linked to S and L 222 strains, were found in multiple samples. Surprisingly, despite high linkage between these 223 two positions, there were 6 samples in which we detected only the T28144C mutation but 224 not the C8782T mutation. Further investigation showed that the T28144C mutant fractions 225 in these 6 samples were all <87%, in contrast to >93% in the other 7 double-mutant 226 samples. These results, together with the intermediate mutation fractions in many other 227 sites, support the co-existence of multiple variants in the same individual. Further 228 investigation is required to understand this phenomenon. 229 230 In summary, MINERVA effectively converts SARS-CoV-2 genomes into sequencing 231 libraries with a simple and quick experimental pipeline, and subsequent target enrichment 232 can further improve SARS-CoV-2 genome coverage and genetic variation detection. 233 MINERVA can facilitate the study of SARS-CoV-2 genetics, and be easily implemented to 234 fight future RNA pathogen outbreaks. epidemiology, physiology, and biology of COVID-19 are evidently unique(9). To speed up 240 our investigation of this virus and the disease it causes, a practical protocol for viral 241 genome research of clinical samples is urgently needed. Currently, methods for 242 transforming clinical samples into sequencing libraries are laborious and painstaking, 243 while clinical personnel at the frontlines are already strained for time and energy. 244 MINERVA minimizes the need for expert technique and hands-on operation; we believe 245 it will be pivotal in accelerating clinical research of SARS-CoV-2. 246 247 Recent evolutionary tracing studies suggest the emergence of multiple novel, evolved 248 subtypes of SARS-CoV-2(10), including the S/L-subtypes(11) and the A/B/C-variants(12). 249 New variants will likely continue to emerge as the virus mutates, and to uncover them 250 requires deep, complete coverage of viral genomes from a large number of patients. With 251 the existence of asymptomatic carriers(13) and possible recurrent infections in the same 252 individual(14), longitudinal re-sampling of patients is also important to uncover intra-host 253 viral heterogeneity, but as viral load decreases with time(15), the sensitivity of the sample 254 processing method becomes critical. These studies all require processing large volumes 255 of clinical samples with a highly robust and scalable method that does not compromise 256 on sensitivity. We have demonstrated that MINERVA libraries from clinical samples can 257 generate deep and complete coverage of SARS-CoV-2 genomes that can be used for 258 evolutionary tracing and variant characterization research. 259 260It is well-established now that SARS-CoV-2 can infect multiple organ systems, tissue 261 compartments, and cell types(3, 4, 16, 17). In our profiling of COVID-19 clinical samples 262 from multiple body sites of the same patient, we found that the viral load and viral263 subtypes vary across different body sites, possibly affected by interactions between 264 microbial and other viral species as well as overall metagenomic diversity present in 265 different microenvironments of each body site. The effects of metatranscriptomic diversity 266 and inter-compartment heterogeneity on SARS-CoV-2 biology and COVID-19 symptom 267severity are also not understood. In particular, it is difficult to obtain high-quality unbiased 268 metatranscriptomes using conventional library construction methods from low-quantity 269 samples, as well as samples such as stool in which bacteria dominate the not created to be a rapid diagnostic assay; rather, we hope its ease-of-277 use, versatility, scalability, sensitivity, and cost-effectiveness will drive adoption of routine 278 sequencing of COVID-19 clinical samples, and thereby facilitate multiple areas of much-279 needed SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19 research for clinicians and researchers.",
