Four structural proteins (surface glycoprotein (QIQ22760.1), envelop glycoprotein (QIQ22762.1), nucleocapsid phosphoprotein (QIQ22768.1) and membrane glycoprotein (QIQ22763.1)) of SARS-CoV-2 are extracted from the NCBI database and further analyzed with ExPASy ProtParam tool. Lucien is the highest in envelope, surface and membrane glycoprotein that is an optimal environment for rapid virus fixation on host cell's surface to the receptor molecule. Transmembrane region prediction was performed by SOSUI server. For all structural proteins, except nucleocapsid Phosphoprotein, the trans-membrane prediction indicates that the virus can enter the host easily. Domain analysis was done by SMART tool. Domain information helps in the function of the viral protein. Lastly, the 3D structure prediction was carried out by Swiss Model and the result validation was achieved by PROCHECK. Such models are the starting point of the community for structural drug and vaccine designs as well as virtual computational screening.",

Infections of (SARS-CoV-2) have been reported in more than 200 countries including Pakistan [1] . The first genome sequence of SARS-CoV-2 to be published from Pakistan and is now available on NCBI https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/MT240479, GISAID and NEXTRAIN. Coronaviruses, a genus belonging to the Coronaviridae family, contain the largest genome (26.4 kb to 31.7 kb) of RNA viruses with a diameter of 120-160 nm, consisting of a single-stranded positive-sense RNA molecule [2] The broad genome has given this family of viruses extra plasticity in their adaptation and alteration of genes. The G + C content of coronavirus genomes ranges from 32% TO 43% The genome consists of seven genes arranged in sequence [5\u2032replicase ORF1ab, spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M), nucleocapside (N)-3\u2032] with small untranslated regions in both termini and additional ORFs in each subgroup of coronavirus. [3, 4] 5 'Non-structural protein coding regions consisting of two-thirds genome replicase genes 1 and structural and non-essential gene. 2-7 regions consisting of structural and non-essential protein coding regions [5] . The genes are translated from genomic mRNA 2 -7. Subgenomic RNAs encode the main Surface Proteins (S), Envelope Protein (E), Membranes Protein (M), and Nucleocapside Protein [6] . Surface protein of SARS CoV-2 join ACE2 (angiotensin-converting enzyme2) and to infect cells. After this initial process, Surface Protein must be produced with an enzyme known as protease to complete entry into the cell. SARS CoV-2 uses TMPRSS 2 in the same way as SARS-CoV is used to complete this process [8] Surface Glycoproteins are outside of the virion and give the typical shape to the virion. The S proteins form homotrimers that allow sun-like morphologies to be developed that give the name Coronaviruses via the Cterminal transmembrane regions, S proteins bind to the virion membrane and interact with M proteins. Virions can be attached through the N-terminus of the S proteins to different surface receptors in the host cell's plasma membrane. The S protein is the receptor-binder and viral input in host cells and is therefore a major therapeutic objective [9] . Membrane Glycoproteins proteins inside the Golgi system are glycosylated. The modification of the M protein is essential for the virion to attach into the cell and make antigenic protein [10] . The protein M plays a key role in the cell's regeneration of virions.
