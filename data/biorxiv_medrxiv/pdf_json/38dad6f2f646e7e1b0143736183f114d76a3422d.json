            "text": "Chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine has recently been the subject of intense debate in regard to its potential antiviral activity against SARS-Cov-2, the etiological agent of COVID-19. Some report possible curative effects, others do not. In order to shed some light on this rather controversial topic, we used mathematical modelling to simulate possible scenarios of response to hydroxychloroquine in COVID-19 patients. Our computer-aided simulations show that hydroxychloroquine may have an impact on the amplitude of the viral load peak but that viral clearance is not significantly accelerated if the drug is not administered early enough (i.e. when viral loads range from 1 to 1,000 copies/mL). Although some authors had used the trough plasma concentrations or the theoretical drug distribution in the lung to model the effect of chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine on COVID-19, the theoretical drug response based on the trough whole blood concentrations of the drug agreed well with the results of the clinical trials so far reported. Moreover, the effects of chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine could be fully explained when taking into account also the capacity of this drug to raise cell-mediated responses against the productively SARS-Cov-2-infected cells. On the whole, the present study suggests that chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine has a narrow therapeutic window, which overlaps with the highest tolerated doses. These considerations may have implications for development of anti-COVID-19 combination therapies and prevention strategies.",

As clinical trials in COVID-19 have so far produced mixed results, further study on the interaction of this drug with the virus/host dynamics in vivo is necessary in order to provide insight into the optimal timing of administration and association with other interventions. However, after many decades of clinical use of hydroxychloroquine, part of its pharmacokinetics is still unknown, and a number of studies still rely on the drug plasma concentrations [3] , which are not an optimal indicator of the biodistribution of this drug, which is a weak base that becomes readily entrapped in intracellular acidic organelles, due to the Henderson-Hasselbach law [1] .",

In light of the plasma concentrations, the in-vivo drug efficacy that they calculated was 33%.

When we used the whole blood concentration (including the drug compartment entrapped in lysosomes) [14] , we calculated a drug efficacy of 0.7, based on the concentration-response curves published by Yao et al.

[4] , and post-entry stages in cellular organelles such as viral budding and viral particle glycosylation [1, 2] (not considered in the aforementioned study). According to the data of Wang et al. [2] , chloroquine displayed approximately half of its antiviral activity when it was added after virus adsorption onto cells, confirming that part of its activity occurs at a post-entry level. Therefore, as we also wanted to estimate the impact of hydroxychloroquine-induced impairment of viral production at times beyond the 48 h period considered to estimate hydroxychloroquine efficacy in vitro [15] , we decreased the viral production rate by 35%, i.e. half of the value calculated on the basis of the drug efficacy on the whole viral replicative cycle.

[3] recently published the trough serum concentrations of hydroxychloroquine obtained from patients with COVID-19 and treated with a higher dosage (i.e. 600 mg/day) of hydroxychloroquine. Unfortunately, no blood concentrations were reported by Gautret et al., but these could be proportionally derived from the ratios provided by Morita et al. [14] , by maintaining a similar plasma/blood concentration ratio. This calculation led to a prediction of drug levels in whole blood of 6.16 \u03bcM. By plotting this value to the dose-response curves published by Yao et al. [15] , we extrapolated an efficacy of 90%: we adjusted the viral infection and production accordingly and obtained a further decrease in the viral load peak (Figure 1 and Supplemental figures S1 and S2, fifth row). This simulation may also account for hydroxychloroquine administered at 400 mg/day in combination with another antiviral agent with moderate potency.",

            "text": "These observations are in line with the clinical data reported so far. A small trial in France suggested that hydroxychloroquine helps treat COVID-19 [3] and a small study from China [19] reported opposite results. Both studies have their own limitations and very limited statistical power, due to the fact that they were prepared during an emergency. The discrepancy of the results obtained may reside, according to the results of the present study, in dosage of hydroxychloroquine adopted, with the French study reporting positive results using 600 mg/day of hydroxychloroquine and the Chinese study being unable to show any efficacy following adoption of a lower dosage (400 mg/day). Furthermore, the reported response to hydroxychloroquine in the French study is incomplete, and the authors had to add another experimental drug repositioned as an antiviral (azithromycin) in order to increase efficacy. These considerations are in line with the results obtained in randomized clinical trials using chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine at an equivalent dosage superior to that reported in the two aforementioned studies [20] [21] [22] . As the safety margin of chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine is narrow [23] , administration of higher dosages is unfortunately hampered by toxicity, as shown by Borba et al. [22] , although recent data show that the toxicity observed by Borba et al. could in fact be ascribed by the concomitant administration of azithromycin [24] . Our results agree in part with the simulations conducted by Arnold and Buckner [25] , showing that only the 600 mg/day regimen might have a significant impact on viral replication according to all parameters that they adopted, and those of Garcia-Cremades et al. [26] , showing that a dosage higher than or equal to 600 mg/day is necessary to obtain a sustained remission. The approach that we have followed is more conservative than that adopted by Arnold and Buckner [25] , in that we used the whole blood concentrations as a measure of prediction of tissue accumulation rather than the predicted accumulation in the lung. According to the model adopted by Arnold and Buckner [25] , the drug lung concentrations are hundreds of times higher than those in plasma and are predicted to reach a concentration able to inhibit 100 percent of SARS-CoV-2 replication. We decided not to follow this prediction because 1) tissue accumulation of hydroxychloroquine in lung is mainly driven by tissue macrophages, which are not a main target for the virus, 2) according to the data published by Yao et al. [15] , 100 per cent of inhibition of coronavirus replication is not reachable experimentally using hydroxychloroquine. Also Smit et al. reached similar conclusions, based on pharmacokinetic considerations [23] .",

Cross-presentation is a phenomenon in which a dendritic cell presents the antigen to CD8+ T-cells, improving their priming. Activation of CD8+ T-cells after priming through antigen recognition can induce the selective killing of the infected cells [16] . Taking into account this parameter it is possible to predict that hydroxychloroquine may accelerate viral clearance but only when administered early. Accordingly, we did not model a scenario of increased cell-mediated responses when viral loads are higher, because immune dysregulation is in this case likely to have taken place. Enhanced cell-mediated responses may not only induce selective killing of the infected cells but also enhance immunity for better long-term control of the infection.",
