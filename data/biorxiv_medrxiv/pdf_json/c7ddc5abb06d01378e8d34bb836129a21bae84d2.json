Several demographic and clinical factors associated with the more aggressive Covid-19 phenotype have been identified: male gender, age over 60 years and the presence of previous comorbidities such as hypertension, diabetes mellitus, obesity, cardiac ischemic disease, lung disease and immunosuppression 5 . It is reasonable to assume SCI as a high-risk comorbidity, mostly due to the presence of respiratory failure as a result of thoracoabdominal muscle weakness 10 and also because of systemic immunosuppression due to injury 6, 7 . Suppresion of the immune system after SCI is due to noradrenergic overactivation and excess glucocorticoid release via hypothalamus-pituitaryadrenal axis stimulation 8 and also to autoimmunity 9 . Both phenomena, respiratory failure and injury-induced immunosuppression are more pronounced after cervical or high-thoracic compared with low-thoracic SCI levels, which explains why pneumonia is the leading cause of mortality in SCI patients 11 . As Covid-19 is a novel viral respiratory infection, its epidemiology and clinical course among people with SCI is yet unknown. However, recently the first survey has been published which addresses COVID-19-related practices and adaptations among health care professionals working with individuals with SCI 12 .

At the onset of Covid-19 infection, fever and asthenia were the most frequently observed symptoms, which slightly differed from other published series that identified cough and fever as initial symptoms in the general population [18] [19] [20] . We agree with the previous case Covid 19 SCI in a patient with SCI which reported that cough was not the prevalent symptom 13 .

The first confirmed imported case of Covid-19 was detected in Spain in La Gomera, (Canary Islands) on January 31, 2020 3 . Since then and up to April 2, 2020, a total of 110,286 cases have been confirmed in Spain, including 10,096 deaths 2 . On March 17, 2020, the first case of Covid-19 was confirmed at the Hospital Nacional de Parapl\u00e9jicos (HNP) in Toledo Spain, a 212-bed national spinal cord injury (SCI) monographic hospital classified as a long-term healthcare facility dedicated to the comprehensive rehabilitation of acute SCI as well as people with chronic SCI with multiple comorbidities. The source of the first patient\u00b4s infection was close contact with their relative, who was also later diagnosed with Covid-19. Since then, despite having isolated the infected patient in the hospital and used personal protective equipment (PPE) against infection by both the healthcare workers and the non-infected patients\u00b4 in quarantine, it was inevitable that new cases of infection were also detected among the patients with up to a total of seven currently confirmed as of April 7, 2020.

In other studies a similar progression in the requirement for respiratory assistance has also been observed for patients who require oxygen therapy[18][19][20] with 98% capillary oxygen saturation achieved with low flow oxygen therapy (less than 3 liters/minute). To date, none of the patients with SCI and Covid-19 infection have required mechanical ventilation support or intensive care admission.In agreement with most of the published studies, all of the COVID-19 cases were confirmed with RT-PCR. The radiological findings also agreed with the published data for Covid-19 infection, with the presentation of bilateral multilobe pneumonia as the most frequent radiological pattern. In addition, two thirds of our cases also presented lymphocytopenia4,18,20 .However, we did not find any alteration of transaminases or LDH levels. Serum ferritin values were obtained in almost all the patients, with only half of them showing moderately elevated levels (< 1000 ng / ml).
