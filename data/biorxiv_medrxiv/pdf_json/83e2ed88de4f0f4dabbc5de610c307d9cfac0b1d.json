Twenty-four (55%) preprint platforms accepted content from all scientific fields although some of these had restrictions relating to funding source, geographical region or an affiliated journal's remit. Thirty-three (75%) preprint platforms provided details about article screening (basic checks) and 14 (32%) of these actively involved researchers with context expertise in the screening process. The three most common screening checks related to the scope of the article, plagiarism and legal/ethical/societal issues and compliance. Almost all preprint platforms allow submission to any peer-reviewed journal following publication, have a preservation plan for read-access, and most have a policy regarding reasons for retraction and the sustainability of the service.

This review provides some justification that preprint platforms might be a reasonable option for researchers, especially given the time spent and associated cost of peer review [25] . In a recent survey of authors that have published with F1000 Research, 70% of respondents found the speed of publication to be important or very important [26] . In some scenarios, the time to deliver research findings may be as equally as important as research quality, and may be critical to health care provision. A good example of this is the current outbreak of novel coronavirus, where much of the preliminary evidence has been made available through preprints at the time of the World Health Organisation declaring the epidemic a public health emergency [27] . The issue of preprints being available before peer review, and also the level of screening before a preprint is posted, has been particularly pertinent in this case. As an example, bioRxiv has rapidly adapted to ensure users appreciate there has not been any peer review of the COVID-19-related work presented on this platform. In light of COVID-19, people including the patients and the public might be interested in a quick and easy way to search across platforms. As a start at improving discoverability, Europe PMC aggregates preprints from several repositories and already nearly 3000 preprint articles with 'COVID-19' in the title are listed [28] .",

Moreover, with many preprints platforms there is little restriction with regards to authors later publishing their preprints in peerreviewed journals of their choice. While we did not tabulate information on this specifically, it was noted that some platforms (notably OSF platforms) did recommend that authors check the SHERPA/RoMEO service for details of a journal's sharing policy. There is also some evidence that pre-printing an article first may even boost citation rates [31] due to increased attention from tweets, blogs and news articles than those articles published without a preprint. With many platforms carrying out suitable quality-control checks and having long-term preservation strategies, preprint platforms offer authors direct control of the dissemination of their research in a rapid, free and open environment. As well as primary research, preprints are also vital to users of research (systematic reviewers and decision makers). As an example, a living mapping systematic review of ongoing research into COVID-19 is currently being undertaken, and almost all included studies to date have been identified through preprint platforms [32] .",

This review has summarised the key characteristics and policies of preprint platforms posting both medical and biomedical content although there is a need for some of these platforms to update their policies and to make them more transparent online. As preprints are not formally validated through peer review, it is important to make it clear that their validity is less certain than for peer-reviewed articles (although even the latter may still not be valid). There is perhaps a growing need to standardise the checking process across platforms; such a process should not diminish the speed of publication (what authors value most about a preprint [22] ). There is the temptation of making the checking process more rigorous, e.g. by including relevant researchers within the field as gatekeepers. However, this may slow down the process of making scientific work rapidly available and may promote groupthink, blocking innovative contrarian ideas to be circulated for public open review in the preprint platforms. Based on current checks, our review shows that most preprint platforms manage to post preprints within 48 hours and all within a week on average. Further challenges may arise on resources if the number of preprints continue to rise at a similar rate and the number of new platforms begins to plateau. And now, as several initiatives progress with work to build scientific review directly onto preprints (e.g. Peer Community in [34] , Review Commons [35] , PREreview [36]), it may become even more important to provide clarity about the level of checks a manuscript has already received and would need to receive to be considered \"certified\" by the scientific community. If anything, the wide public availability of preprints allows for far more extensive review by many reviewers, as opposed to the typical journal peer-review where only a couple of reviewers are involved. Our review identified 14 platforms linked to for-profit publishers and companies but only F1000 Research currently charges a small article processing charge to authors. With the increase in demand and resources needed to maintain preprint platforms, we should be mindful that article processing charges may change downstream meaning that platforms may have to charge authors; this would be unfortunate in light of the open science movement.",

While arXiv, bioRxiv, chemRxiv and medRxiv aim to provide dedicated servers for academics within each field they are dedicated to, several academic groups have offered alternative subject-specific or regional services in line with their own community's needs, such as sharing work in languages other than English, using the OSF infrastructure. A third provider of preprint platforms is industry stakeholders: as academic publishers providing or acquiring preprint services to support the content they receive as submissions to their journals, and as biotechnology or pharmaceutical companies looking to support the sharing of relevant research content. Whether any platform becomes dominant may be influenced by the communities who adopt them, the influencers who promote them (funders and researchers who influence hiring and promotion decisions) and the financial sustainability underpinning them. We hope that enabling transparency into the processes and policies at each platform empowers the research community (including researchers, funders and others involved in the enterprise) to identify and support the platform(s) that help them to share research results most effectively. \"  T  h  e  F  r  e  n  c  h  s  e  r  v  e  r  f  o  r  P  r  e  p  r  i  n  t  s  i  n  a  l  l  t  h  e   s  c  i  e  n  t  i  f  i  c  f  i  e  l  d  s  \"   A  l  l  s  c  i  e  n  t  i  f  i  c  f  i  e  l  d  s  O   b   :  S  m  a  l  l  g  r  o  u  p  o  f  e  n  t  h  u  s  i  a  s  t  s   O  T  :  I  n  d  i  v  i  d  u  a  l  o  r  c  o  m  m  u  n  i  t  y   P  :  N  o  n  -p  r  o  f  i  t  o  r  n  o  t  -f  o  r  -p  r  o  f  i  t   T  :  O  p  e  n  S  c  i  e  n  c  e  F  r  a  m  e  w  o  r  k  (  o  p  e  n  s  o  u  r  c  e  )   T  :  A  f  e  w  d  a  y  s   C  :  N  o  f  e  e  t  o  a  u  t  h  o  r   I  N  A  -R  x  i  v  [  7  ]   (  1  7  A  u  g  u  s  t  2  0  1  7  ;  1  6  ,  6  3  7  )   V  e  r  i  f  i  e  d   \"  A  p  r  e  p  r  i  n  t  s  e  r  v  e  r  f  o  r  I  n  d  o  n  e  s  i  a  n  a  c  a  d  e  m  i  a   t  o  p  r  o  v  i  d  e  a  n  o  p  e  n  ,  f  r  e  e  a  n  d  s  u  s  t  a  i  n  a  b  l  e   s  c  i  e  n  t  i  f  i  c  r  e  p  o  s  i  t  o  r  y  \"   A  l  l  s  c  i  e  n  t  i  f  i  c  f  i  e  l  d  s  O   b   :  I  n  d  o  n  e  s  i  a  o  p  e  n  s  c  i  e  n  c  e  t  e  a  m   O  T  :  A  c  a  d  e  m  i  c  c  o  m  m  u  n  i  t  y  g  r  o  u  p   P : T  :  O  p  e  n  S  c  i  e  n  c  e  F  r  a  m  e  w  o  r  k  (  o  p  e  n  s  o  u  r  c O  p  e  n  a  r  c  h  i  v  e  f  o  r  r  e  s  e  a  r  c  h  o  n  m  i  n  d  a  n  d   c  o  n  t  e  m  p  l  a  t  i  v  e  p  r  a  c  t  i  c  e  s  \"   R  e  l  a  t  i  n  g  t  o  m  i  n  d  a  n  d  c  o  n  t  e  m  p  l  a  t  i  v  e  p  r  a  c  t  i  c  e  s  ,   i  n  c  l  u  d  i  n  g  m  e  d  i  c  i  n  e  a  n  d  h  e  a  l  t  h  s  c  i  e  n  c  e  s  ,   n  e  u  r  o  s  c  i  e  n  c  e  a  n  d  n  e  u  r  o  b  i  o  l  o  g  y  ,  p  s  y  c  h  o  l  o  g  y  ,   s  o  c  i  a  l  a  n  d  b  e  h  a  v  i  o  u  r  a  l  s  c  i  e  n  c  e  s   O   b   :  M  i  n  d  a  n  d  L  i  f  e  I  n  s  t  i  t  u  t  e   O  T  :  A  c  a  d  e  m  i  c  i  n  s  t  i  t  u  t  i  o  n   P  :  N  o  n  -p  r  o  f  i  t  o  r  n  o  t  -f  o  r  -p  r  o  f  i  t   T  :  O  p  e  n  S  c  i  e  n  c  e  F  r  a  m  e  w  o  r  k  (  o  p  e i  s  t  h  e  f  i  r  s  t  c  o  m  m  u  n  i  t  y  -l  e  d  a  n  d  o  p  e  n   a  c  c  e  s  s  s  u  b  j  e  c  t  r  e  p  o  s  i  t  o  r  y  d  e  d  i  c  a  t  e  d  t  o  s  p  o  r  t  ,   e  x  e  r  c  i  s  e  ,  p  e  r  f  o  r  m  a  n  c  e  ,  a  n  d  h  e  a  l  t  h  r  e  s  e  a  r  c  h  \"   R  e  l  a  t  i  n  g  t  o  s  p  o  r  t  s  a  n  d  e  x  e  r  c  i  s  e  s  c  i  e  n  c  e  ,  i  n  c  l  u  d  i  n  g   r  e  h  a  b  i  l  i  t  a  t  i  o  n  a  n  d  t  h  e  r  a  p  y  ,  t  h  e  a  t  r  e  ,  d  a  n  c  e  ,   p  h  y  s  i  o  l  o  g  y  ,  p  h  y  s  i  o  t  h  e  r  a  p  y  ,  p  s  y  c  h  o  l  o  g  y  ,  s  o  c  i  o  l  o  g  y   O   b   :  S  o  c  i  e  t  y  f  o  r  T  r  a  n  s  p  a  r  e  n  c  y  ,  O  p  e  n  n  e  s  s  ,  a  n  d   R  e  p  l  i  c  a  t  i  o  n  i  n  K  i  n  e  s  i  o  l  o  g  y  (  S  T  O  R  K  )   O  T  :  S  c  i  e  n  t  i  f  i  c  s  o  c  i  e  t  y   P  :  N  o  n  -p  r  o  f  i  t  o  r  n  o  t  -f  o  r  -p  r  o  f  i  t   T  :  O  p  e  n  S  c  i  e  n  c  e  F  r  a  m  e  w  o  r  k  (  o  p  e  n  s  o  u  r  c  e  )   T  :  A  f  e  w  d  a  y  s   C  :  N  o  f  e  e  t  o  a  u  t  h  o  r   T  h  e  s  i  s  C  o  m  m  o  n  s  [  1  7  ]   (  2  1  A  p  r  i  l  2  0  1  7  ;  5  8  3  )   V  e  r  i  f  i  e  d   \"  A  n  o  p  e  n  a  r  c  h  i  v  e  o  f  t  h  e  s  e  s  \"  A  l  l  s  c  i  e  n  t  i  f  i  c  f  i  e  l  d  s  O   b   :  C  e  n  t  e  r  f  o  r  O  p  e  n  S  c  i  e  n  c  e  a  n  d  s  m  a  l  l  g  r  o  u  p  o  f   e  n  t  h  u  s  i  a  s  t  s   O  T  :  A  c  a  d  e  m  i  c  c  o  m  m  u  n  i  t  y  g  r  o  u  p  ;  c  h  a  r  i  t  y   P : .
