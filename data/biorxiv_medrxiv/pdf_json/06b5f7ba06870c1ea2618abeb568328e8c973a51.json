The SEIR model has been used to model infectious diseases in Malaysia.Then, the spread and control of the disease is simulated applying a PID controller. The results of this study show that the implementation of strict restrictions such as quarantine, social distancing and closure of gathering centers is effective in controlling the disease. Using the results and analyzing them, it was found that early and strict implementation of strict restrictions such as quarantine, social distance and closure of centers with a high percentage of community is very important to control this disease and prevent irreparable economic losses and depreciation of medical staff.",

One of the important effects of this virus was the impact on the lifestyle of human societies. On the other hand, there is a high epidemic of this virus, the control of which is complicated. Governments played a key role in countering coronavirus (2019-nCoV)in this campaign, from changing the health practices of communities such as emphasizing personal hygiene to very strict quarantine in Wuhan, China (the primary source of the disease) [2] . Disconnection between countries and closure of many sacred facilities in countries such as Iran [3] , All of this was a sign of a new world of disease. According to the World Health Organization, due to the rapid transmission of the virus between humans, the only way to prevent the spread of coronavirus (2019-nCoV) is to cut off the human communication chain and maintain personal hygiene [1] . In this regard, countries have used various methods in this regard, for example, Iran has taken important steps to prevent the growth of the disease by closing many markets, higher education and implementing a social distance plan at the same time with the start of the New Year holiday [4] . South Korea is another country where people are exposed to the virus. Although the government constantly warned its citizens about health issues, there were no restrictions on travel in polluted areas, and even businesses continued to operate. In mid-February, the country considered the toughest quarantine measures for some cities and the northern province of Gyeongsang. Closing higher education centers and schools for long periods, preventing rallies and gatherings, using electronic maps to identify patients and knowing how they are moving, quarantining patients, allocating supplementary funding to fight corona virus (2019-nCoV), and raising alert levels Other Korean actions have been taken [7] . Hong Kong Despite its proximity to China and extensive ties to the country, it has also been successful in controlling the virus [5, 6, 7] . Hong Kong's most important actions include;Strict regulations and heavy penalties for those who do not comply with the regulations. Allocating subsidies to all citizens to compensate for the closure of private businesses, Low-interest loans to large businesses and free distribution of masks and health goods to the poor population [7, 8] . Another East Asian country has been affected by the Japanese virus, which, despite its vulnerable elderly population, has kept the virus-causing death rate very low. The Japanese with actions such as; Promoting telecommuting of large and small offices and companies, Assignment of some decisions to local governments in accordance with the instructions of the Ministry of Health, Long-term closure of schools and universities and subsidies for workers and employees to stay at home to care for children, Closing all gatherings and public places and increasing the capacity to perform diagnostic tests to about 4,000 cases per day, They were able to cope well with the spread of the virus [9, 7] .",

The dynamic complexity of each disease dictates the use of simple mathematical models to gain insight into the spread of disease and test control strategies [10] . Since it was the first application of optimal control in biomedical engineering in the 1980s [11] , several vaccination strategies for infectious diseases have been successfully modeled as optimal control problems. The so-called computational models have been widely used in this field. One of these models is SEIR, which is based on dividing the study population into four parts. The person may be susceptible (S) to the disease but not yet infected (E), infectious (I), or improved (immune) (R). SEIR models can show many infectious human diseases such as measles, smallpox, influenza, dengue, etc. [12] , but in this article we will look at a general SEIR model. Generally, to achieve the goal in the shortest possible time, dynamic models use the principles of control engineering theory.",

Financial control, community behavior, pest control, engine control, robot control, and hundreds of other examples are familiar with these applications. It can also be said \"Power without control is worthless\". This statement is true in many areas, such as technology and social issues. For example, when a person feels cold (feeling the stage). It decides to wear and act on it (the decision-making stage and then the control action) and thus provides itself with warmer and more comfortable conditions (purpose). This is an example of biological feedback due to changes in the environment.
