To this end, we describe estimands for outcome types of particular interest in these trials (ordinal and time-to-event). When the outcome is ordinal, the estimands that we consider are the difference between study arms in the mean outcome, the Mann-Whitney (rank-based) estimand, and the average of the cumulative log odds ratios over the levels of the outcome. For time-to-event outcomes, we consider the difference between arms in the restricted mean survival time, the difference between arms in the cumulative incidence, and the relative risk. Advantageously, the interpretability of these estimands does not rely on a proportional odds or proportional hazards assumptions. For each estimand, we evaluate the potential value added by using estimators that leverage information in baseline variables to improve precision and reduce the required sample size to achieve a desired power. These are called covariate adjusted estimators. To evaluate the performance of the covariate adjusted and unadjusted estimators that we present, we simulate two-arm, randomized trials comparing a hypothetical COVID-19 treatment versus standard of care, where the primary outcome is ordinal or time-to-event. Our simulated distributions are derived from two sources: longitudinal data on over 500 patients hospitalized at Weill",

We conduct simulations using all three estimands when the outcome is ordinal, but only evaluate the restricted mean survival time when the outcome is time to event. Our simulations showed that, in trials with at least 200 participants, the precision gains due to covariate adjustment are equivalent to requiring 10-20% fewer participants to achieve the same power as a trial that uses the unadjusted estimator; this was the case for each outcome and estimand that we considered.",

Adjusting for prognostic baseline variables is called covariate adjustment. Though there appears to be general agreement among regulators [8, 9] on how to adjust for baseline variables when the outcome is continuous valued (i.e., using analysis of covariance, abbreviated as ANCOVA), there is less specific guidance for several outcome types of interest in COVID-19 treatment trials, namely binary, ordinal, or time to event outcomes [1] . We evaluate the performance of covariate adjusted estimators for ordinal and time to event outcomes. Binary outcomes are a special case where the ordinal outcome has two levels, and the standardization approach of [13, 17] can be applied.",

It uses working models, i.e., models that are fit in the process of computing the estimator but which we do not assume to be correctly specified (and for which consistency and asymptotic normality still hold under arbitrary model misspecification). Specifically, this estimator makes use of a treatment-stratified proportional odds working model that assumes that, within each treatment arm, the CDF of the ordinal outcome satisfies the proportional odds assumption based on a linear combination of the baseline covariates. This yields two working covariate-conditional CDFs (one per treatment arm). Our final treatment-specific marginal CDFs are obtained by averaging these conditional CDFs across the pooled covariates from the two treatment arms. Importantly, the validity of this estimator (e.g., asymptotic unbiasedness, asymptotic normality) does not rely on correct specification of the working treatment-stratified proportional odds model 3 that this estimator uses. The fact that our CDF estimator is robust to misspecification of the outcome working model is reminiscent of the fact that ANCOVA estimator can be used for covariate adjustment when the outcome is continuous [24, 22] . We also refer the reader to the following references for further discussion of the benefits of covariate adjustment: for the DIM, see [22] ; for the MW estimand, see [21] ; for the LOR, see [6] ; in the case that the ordinal outcome takes only two values, see [14] , whose general discussion applies to all three estimands.",

Adjusted estimators are obtained by computing time-specific hazard probabilities which are transformed using the productlimit formula and marginalized over covariates. The adjusted approach has two key benefits relative to unadjusted alternatives, for example, those based on an unadjusted Kaplan-Meier estimator [11] . First, under regularity conditions, the adjusted estimator is at least as precise as the unadjusted estimator, asymptotically. Second, the adjusted estimator's consistency depends on an assumption of censoring being independent of the outcome given study arm and baseline covariates, rather than an assumption of censoring in each arm being independent of the outcome marginally; see Eqs. 3 and 4 in Appendix B. The former may be a more plausible assumption. Similar covariate adjusted estimators for the CID and RR are also available [2] .",

For example, if the observed probability of death is similar in the two arms but the probability of ICU admissions is smaller in the treatment arm, then this will be evident in the plots. We also recommend to plot simultaneous confidence bands to represent uncertainty about the estimated curves.
