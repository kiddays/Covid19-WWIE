The COVID-19 Response Team (CRT) at Imperial College London has responded to this challenge, in part, by developing a Bayesian hierarchical model to estimate the true number of infections and the impact of policies intended to slow the epidemic [3] . In this paper, we apply the CRT model to individual states in the United States, plus Puerto Rico and Washington, D.C. We remove states with fewer than 10 reported fatalities. We also reproduce the CRT estimates for 11 European countries with data through April 18, 2020.",

It also relies on four values estimated from prior research: 1) the infection fatality ratio (IFR) by age, 2) the serial interval distribution, 3) the infection-to-onset distribution, and 4) the onset-to-death distribution. These values are measured from several cases in which all members of a small population at high risk of infection were tested and observed, whether or not they showed symptoms. They are not extracted from population data based on testing people who are already symptomatic. We discuss the IFR further in section III.",

Second, the model extrapolates exponential growth rates without reference to the size of the population. If the estimated attack rate approaches the level of herd immunity, the model likely overestimates the total number of infections. Third, we assume the IFR is known exactly.

It fits one value for each of these variables across all populations simultaneously. The impact of any given intervention is the same for all populations. Most of the interventions were implemented in Europe before the United States. Therefore, the model estimates the impact of these interventions mostly based on the trajectory of the epidemic in Europe. Using the number of fatalities as of a given time, we can infer the number of infections in the past, and extrapolate them to the present using the fitted reproduction numbers under different policy regimes. The model does not use the reported number of infections. This approach differs from the CRT's model in [4] , which is a detailed SIR model. Instead, this model more closely matches that of the UW IHME [5] , which forecasts exponential growth rates after different policies are implemented based on historical growth rates in countries and states that previously implemented similar policies.",
