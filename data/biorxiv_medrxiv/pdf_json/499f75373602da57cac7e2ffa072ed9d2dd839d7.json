At the same committee, Pr. Raoult's recommendation was not to confine the population but to test, confine and treat infected people. In the end, the political decision has been the containment given the dramatic risk of * I would thank warmly my son Quentin with his wife Gina and my friend Alain Poignet for a lot of discussions and encouragement to write this paper and for their help to improve and correct it. 500 000 deaths.

This is why we have to estimate the number of deaths avoided by this decision. From this discussion above, we can first determine the avoided number of infected-recovered people O. It can be obtained easily by O = exp(B/A) \u2212 exp(B /A ). On the one hand (B, A) are parameters provided before the containment, and on the other hand, (B , A ) are parameters at the present time based on observations since the containment decision time has decided. It is approximately equal to O = exp(0.617/0.05) \u2212 exp(0.943/0.079) = 76 000. Now, to give an estimate of avoided death number, we have to use a death rate defined as the number of death in hospitals divided by the number of observed infected-recovered people counted in hospitals. But this death rate changes a lot over time (see Figure-6). We can see the rate is approximately",
