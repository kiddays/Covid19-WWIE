There is still a distributional disequilibrium in the prevalence of infections globally; the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases changes daily and the trajectories largely differs among countries or regions. Moreover, the absence of population-wide testing for COVID-19 makes it difficult to investigate the growth dynamics of COVID-19 infection. The case data includes selection bias due to surveillance focusing mainly on symptomatic persons. In particular, the availability of the test using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to identify COVID-19 cases, e.g. the number of PCR tests conducted per population, varies greatly among countries with different medical/public-health conditions (https://ourworldindata.org/covid-testing).

This finding is in line with a report by Coelho et al. (2020) , which emphasized the role of the air transportation network in this epidemic. In addition, region-specific susceptibility, which here was surrogated by BCG vaccination, malaria infection (maybe linked to anti-malarial drugs use), and the elderly population aged over 65 years, explained a substantial part of the variance in COVID-19 cases across the globe: this supports the findings by Sala and Miyakawa (2020) that show a significant correlation between BCG vaccination and COVID-19 prevalence. We note that these correlation patterns may change as this epidemic progresses; a correlation with malaria infection was relatively robust, but the regression coefficients of BCG vaccination effect with the COVID-19 cases (per 1 million population) seems to be less influential after April 2020, which is due to the recent spreads in some particular countries with BCG vaccination program (e.g. Japan, Russia, Turkey and Brazil).",

Moreover, additional analyses, which accounted for the number of tests as a covariate, revealed very similar patterns of regression coefficients of the model and their explanatory power (Fig. S2): the role of climate, international human mobility, and host susceptibility became evident as the epidemic progressed. Therefore, the nonlinearity of epidemic and region-specific testing bias had no serious influence on identifying environmental drivers shaping the present COVID-19 distribution.This study generally supports the findings of several recent reports, which found that climate(Baker et al. 2020; Ara\u00fajo and Naimi 2020; Sajadi et al. 2020), international human mobility(Wells et al. 2020; Coelho et al. 2020), and community-based host susceptibility (Sala and Miyakawa 2020) jointly contributed to the spread of COVID-19.",
