To contain its spread, China adopted unprecedented nationwide interventions on January 23. We sought to show how these control measures impacted the containment of the epidemic. We proposed an SEIR(Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Removed) model to analyze the epidemic trend in Wuhan and use the AI model to analyze the epidemic trend in non-Wuhan areas. We found that if the closure was lifted, the outbreak in non-Wuhan areas of mainland China would double in size. Our SEIR and AI model was effective in predicting the COVID-19 epidemic peaks and sizes. The implementation of control measures on January 23, 2020, was indispensable in reducing the eventual COVID-19 epidemic size.",

Huang [22] et al. proposed a simple data-driven model based on natural growth, predicting that the number of infections would peak on approximately February 5, with a cumulative number of confirmed cases between 37,000 and 44,000. On February 24, 2020, Huwen Wang et al. [23] used SEIR(Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Removed) model and proposed that the infection coefficient R0 decreased from 2.5 to 0.5 with virus variation and government policy, which had an impact on the prediction.On 19 March 2020, Joseph T. Wu et al. [24] used SEIR(Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Removed) model and they study the influence of infection rate, removal rate in different age groups and migration data on prediction model.On March 25, 2020, Moritz U.G.Kraemer et al. [25] used GLM (generalized linear models) model to consider the impact of population migration and age on the number of infected people.On February 28, Zhong Nanshan et al.

Therefore, it is still necessary to study the epidemic trend of COVID-19 at the current stage, which is of practical significance for the analysis, prevention and control of the epidemic [27] . According to the characteristics of the Wuhan and non-Wuhan regions, the SEIR model and deep learning model were established, respectively, considering the population flow. By using the actual data and referring to the existing literature and reports, the parameters of the new model were fitted. Finally, the model was used to estimate and analyze the epidemic trend.",

The Chinese joint investigation report on novel coronavirus pneumonia (COVID - 19) [33] shows that the spread of the epidemic in China has distinct characteristics in the Wuhan and non-Wuhan areas of China. The newly infected cases in Wuhan were mainly original cases in Wuhan. As Wuhan is the traffic center of China and the epidemic spread rapidly during the Spring Festival travel rush, the newly infected cases in non-Wuhan areas were mainly imported from Wuhan.
