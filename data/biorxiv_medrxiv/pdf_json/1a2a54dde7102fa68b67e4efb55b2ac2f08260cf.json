Among the 46 nonsurvivors, 52\u00b72% (24/46) had severe thrombocytopenia, compared to 6\u00b77% (1/15) among survivors. Moreover, continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) could induce a significant decrease in PLT in 81\u00b73% of critical CRRT patients (13/16), resulting in a fatal outcome. In addition, a high level of anti-heparin-PF4 antibodies, a marker of HIT, was observed in most ICU patients. Surprisingly, HIT occurred not only in patients with heparin exposure, such as CRRT, but also in heparin-na\u00efve patients, suggesting that spontaneous HIT may occur in COVID-19.",

[1] [2] [3] Currently, the mortality of COVID-19 has reached as high as 13%, such as in France and Italy. 4 In China, approximately 81% of COVID-19 patients have been mild cases, whereas 14% have been severe cases with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) that require ventilator support, and 5% have been critical patients who need intensive care unit (ICU) admission. 5 The survival rate of critical patients is no more than 50%. Elderly people and people who have underlying medical conditions are at higher risk for developing more serious complications, such as septic shock, ARDS, acute kidney injury (AKI), and fulminant myocarditis. 6, 7 Approximately 81% of deaths occurred among people aged >60 years in China. 5 As a new infectious disease, COVID-19 is characterized by severe acute respiratory injury and hyperinflammation-related syndromes. The poor prognosis predictors uncovered by retrospective studies include hypercytokinemia 6 , significantly elevated hallmarks of an inflammatory response (e.g. IL-6, Creactive protein (CRP), and serum ferrin) and organ failure (e.g., aspartate or alanine transaminase (AST or ALT), cardiac troponin, and blood urea nitrogen (BUN)), 7, 8 and SARS-CoV-2-related RNAemia. 9 Additionally, severe thrombocytopenia, elevated neutrophils, and reduced lymphocyte have also been reported extensively in critical patients. 10, 11 Combined with progressive pulmonary lesions on CT imaging, these findings may be helpful to establish more appropriate clinical guidance for critically ill cases.",

            "text": "A low platelet count or thrombocytopenia is associated with an increased risk of severe disease and mortality in patients with SARS and COVID-19 for reasons that are not fully understood. 12 Heparininduced thrombocytopenia (HIT) is a well-recognized complication of heparin therapy, and can occur spontaneously, independent of heparin. [13] [14] [15] HIT is caused by the binding of heparin to platelet factor 4 (PF4) released from activated platelets, as antibodies against the heparin-PF4 complex are induced in some patients. Subsequently, the antibody-PF4-heparin complex binds to the platelet Fc\u03b3IIa receptor, inducing platelet activation and aggregation, activation of the coagulation pathways and an eventual loss of circulating platelets, with a prothrombotic state. 16, 17 Nevertheless, HIT can be induced in the absence of proximate heparin exposure, so-called spontaneous HIT, by negatively charged bacterial, nucleic acids, and hypersulfated chondroitin. [18] [19] [20] Most patients who develop spontaneous HIT have proximate episodes of infection or major surgery. 18 In this study, 61 critical ICU patients and 93 severe non-ICU patients hospitalized from February 8 to April 03 at Huoshenshan Hospital (Wuhan, China), an emergency hospital established in for COVID-19 patients, were included. We found that a substantial percentage of the critical ICU patients (31\u00b71%, 19/61) who showed severe, progressive decreases in platelet counts, often with fatal outcomes. Further analysis showed an elevated level of anti-heparin-PF4 antibodies (HIT antibodies) in critical patients, which suggested that HIT contribute greatly to the fatal outcome in COVID-19 patients in critical condition.",

Countermeasures such as transfusion with blood cells, platelets or fresh frozen plasma (FFP) showed little if any effect on the PLT decreases (figure 1A and S1A), suggesting that progressive PLT exhaustion occurred in dying COVID-19 patients for unknown reason other than blood coagulation factor exhaustion. Administration of tocilizumab (TCZ), an inhibitor of inflammation that has been suggested for used in COVID-19 by Chinese guidelines for COVID-19, seemed to be able to reverse the changes in PLT transiently in patient P1-P6, except P2, but severe thrombocytopenia recurred a few days after the administration (figure 1A). As a control, only one out of fifteen ICU survivors (patient P57) showed extremely low PLT, but without a progressive PLT decrease (figure 2A and 2B).

It has been reported that the release of heparin from master cells could be induced by complement activation, which may indicate the potential role of endogenous heparin in spontaneous HIT after viral infection. 22, 23 Moreover, as reported by other studies, a higher percentage of neutrophils was observed in nonsurviving critical COVID-19 patients, which may further contribute to the severity of HIT, but not in surviving critical COVID-19 patients (figure 4F and S1D). 10, 24 In addition to laboratory tests, venous and arterial complications, including deep venous thromboembolic complications, were observed in patients who died of COVID-19 by autopsy. 25 Among three nonsurviving ICU patients who received an autopsy, hyaline thrombus and other thrombi were found in patient P12, who showed a progressive decrease in PLT. Bleeding in lung tissues but no thrombi were observed in patient P17 with constantly low PLT counts (figure S1A). Furthermore, no obvious bleeding or thrombi occurred in patient P5, who had a significant decrease in PLT counts, but the lowest point was well above 100\u00d710 9 /L. Confirmed vein thromboembolism (VTE) in ICU COVID-19 patients by CT pulmonary angiography (CTPA) or ultrasonography was also reported recently. 26 Although the platelet activation assay was not performed because of the limited capacity of Huoshenshan Hospital, current results still strongly suggested that HIT or spontaneous HIT, induced by the virus or a secondary bacterial infection, may occur in COVID-19, which would be significantly boosted and aggravated by further heparin exposure with a high dose, thereby resulting in a fatal outcome.",

            "text": "Here, we show that HIT occurred frequently in severe COVID-19 patients who received heparininvolved therapy, or were heparin-na\u00efve (as spontaneous HIT). The widely used diagnostic criteria of HIT include: 1) HIT antibodies to complexes of heparinoid (heparin or similar glycosaminoglycans) and PF4; 2) HIT antibodies-mediated platelet activation; 3) a progressive PLT decrease of at least 40-50% or more from baseline; 4) onset of thrombocytopenia occuring within five to ten days after initiation of heparin or 24 to 48 hours after heparin re-exposure; and 5) thrombosis in patients treated with heparin. 20, 30, 31 In this study, severe thrombocytopenia (PLT<50\u00d710 9 /L), a >50% of PLT decrease, rapid decrease upon CRRT treatment (high level of heparin exposure), high levels of HIT antibodies, and venous, arterial and even deep venous thrombi in patients who died of COVID-19 basically fits the clinical definition of HIT. Notably, HIT antibodies and a progressive decrease in PLT were also detected in heparin-na\u00efve patients (i.e., before CRRT or other heparin exposure), even in non-ICU patients (figure 4B), indicating the occurrence of spontaneous HIT in COVID-19 patients, which probably results from virus itself or a secondary bacterial infection, such as PF4-conjugated Staphylococcus aureus or Escherichia coli, or severe tissue damage. 18 Immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP), an autoimmune disorder similar to HIT, has been reported in HKU1 coronavirus infected patient. 32 In non-ICU patients, a progressive PLT decrease is rarely occurred, either because of the less severe viral and secondary bacterial infection or the far lower level of heparin exposure, since heparin was primarily administered for flushing the central venous catheter but not for prevention blood clots and treatment of venous thrombosis in ICU patients. The moderate PLT decrease in non-ICU patients with HIT is transient and can be recovered during convalescence. Although a protective effect of heparin-involved anticoagulation in severe COVID-19 has been reported by Tang et al., 33 the potential risk of HIT should be cautioned when it's used to treat critical ICU patients with a high dosage.",

For preimmunized patients, subsequent exposure to a high dosage of heparin in anticoagulation therapy, such as CRRT and coagulation control, will significantly boost the preformed B cells via a lot of heparin-PF4 complexes, thereby prompting the activation and consumption of platelet, resulting in progressive thrombocytopenia and extensive coagulation in deteriorating COVID-19 patients. This may explain the high mortality in critically ill patients receiving CRRT (93\u00b78%, 15/16). As an important supportive treatment for critically ill patients with sepsis or AKI, CRRT is used to efficiently remove proinflammatory mediators accumulated in the blood and maintain fluid balance in hemodynamically unstable patients, 35 which has been recommended for renal failure and renal replacement therapy in the Chinese Clinical Guidance for COVID-19. 36 However, accumulating clinical data showed that there were nearly no survivors among critical COVID-19 patients who received CRRT treatment, indicating that patients did not benefit from CRRT. 6, 8, 11 Here, we show that serious HIT may be responsible for the high fatality of CRRT in critical COVID-19 patients. Therefore, we suggeste that the clinical occurrence of HIT in COVID-19 patients, especially critical patients, should be detected and monitored carefully. For those COVID-19 patients strongly suspected of having HIT, the physician should stop all heparin-involved therapy and initiate an alternative anticoagulant other than heparin, such as platelet aggregation inhibitor prostacyclin, direct thrombin inhibitors (e.g., lepirudin), nonheparin glycosaminoglycan with anti-factor Xa activity (e.g., fondaparinux), or regional citrate anticoagulation, to avoid the risk of HIT-induced thrombosis in COVID-19 patients.",
