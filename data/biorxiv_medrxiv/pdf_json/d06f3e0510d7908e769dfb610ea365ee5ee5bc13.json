In rapid succession in March 2020, multiple assays have become available including 40 both FDA-EUA test platforms and laboratory developed tests (LDTs) for use in high-complexity 41 clinical laboratories. To solve supply chain difficulties, clinical laboratories have had to 42 implement multiple assays using scarce reagent resources, rendering thorough comparisons 43 challenging. A clear understanding of the analytical parameters of these options is important to 44 help guide assay selection by clinical laboratories when supply chain considerations subside (4). Finally, 28 specimens were used to compare the SARS-CoV-2 assay on the UW Panther Fusion 74 with the DiaSorin Simplexa assay. All same-sample comparisons were performed on specimens 75 stored at 4 o C for less than 72 hours with no freeze-thaws. Inconclusive results (one of two 76 targets detected) were considered positive due to the high specificity of all assays and limited 77 cross-reactivity seen for SARS-CoV-2 primer sets.
