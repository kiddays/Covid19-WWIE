The methodology allowed us to estimate that the maximum limit for the total number of cases of COVID-19 patients such as those registered with the World Health Organization will be approximately one million and one hundred thousand cases to the United States. Up to 04/19/20 the models indicate that United States reached 70% of this maximum number of \"total cases\" and the United States will reach 95% of this limit by 05/14/2020. The application of the nonlinear fitting of growth curves to the individual data of each American state showed that only 25% of them did not reach, on 04/19/20, the percentage of 59% of the maximum limit of \"total cases\" and that 17 of the 50 states still will not have reached 95% of that limit on 05/14/20.",

For the United States according to the \"...CDC case counts and death counts include boh confirmed and probable cases and deaths. \" (CDC, 2000) . Daily statistics on the number of new cases, total cases and deaths have been the main variables for controlling the impact of COVID19 on society and especially on the capacity of the hospital health system to take into account the number of critical cases. The real impact of COVID19 in the world will hardly be known as there are many asymptomatic cases and we have limitations in the ability to carry out tests to confirm this disease, although the United States was the country that performed the most tests 4,026,360 however it reached 12,164 per 1 million people, as data from April 20, 2020 (https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/country/us/). Several researchers have presented models to predict the evolution of the number of cases of infected by COVID19. Bliznashki (2020) applied a Bayesian Logistic Growth model to the COVID-19 data cases in the period between 4 th of March and 31 th of March and found that the data in this interval have small number of available data points without upper asymptote to can be well fitted by this model, but it will be useful with more actualizated data. Mondal and Ghosh (2020) studied the scenarios of the exponential and sigmoid growth of COVID-19 total cases data for 15 states of India considering a initial exponential growth and a extrapolation with a sigmoid-type profile. Peirlinck et al. (2020) estimated to the United States the nationwide peak of the outbreak on May 10, 2020 with 3 million infections across the United States.",

Model forecasts were made for Hubei (China) and South Korea, which are already in the stable control phase of COVID19 and the results of the total number of cases in the model adjusted well to the data of total cases observed on April 19, 2020 (comparing the predicted cases with those observed and verifying the low relative error value). The maximum percentage reached according to the model for that date was also estimated, as well as the forecast of dates when according to the model a percentage of 95% and 99%, respectively, of the maximum value of the total cases predicted in the model are reached. For the total case data from the United States, we had the Gompertz model as the best fit, from which we have an estimated maximum for the total MAX_Cases cases of 1,122,702.72. For April 19, 2020, the comparison between the number of cases predicted by the model and those observed results in a relative error of -0.62% and on this day the total number of cases predicted by the model corresponds to a percentage of 67, 19% in relation to the maximum of MAX_Cases total cases.
