These codes included International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision and tenth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM) codes U07.1 (COVID-19, virus identified), B34.2 (Coronavirus infection, unspecified), B97.29 (Other coronavirus as the cause of diseases classified elsewhere) and J12.81 (Pneumonia due to SARS-associated coronavirus). Patients identified with diagnosis code 079.89 (Other specified viral infection) were excluded. Only patients diagnosed with the codes, as mentioned earlier between January 20, 2020 (first confirmed case in the USA) to April 15, 2020, were included. The B97.29 code was specifically included based on the recommendation from the general guidance of the ICD-10-CM Official Coding Guidelines released by the CDC on February 20, 2020. Similarly, U07.1 is the new specific code for a confirmed diagnosis of the COVID-19 with a positive COVID-19 test result starting April 1, 2020, as per the new CDC guidelines. The codes B34.2 and J12.81 were used more often before the CDC guidelines. Patients with ICD-9 code 079.89 (mapped to ICD-10 code B34.2 and B97.2) were excluded to reduce any false positive COVID-19 patients because this ICD-9 code can still be used occasionally as \"catch-all' code for more than 50 viral infections.",
