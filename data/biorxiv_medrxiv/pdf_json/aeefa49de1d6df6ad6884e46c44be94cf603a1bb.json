In this paper, the authors forecast the spread of the Coronavirus outbreak and study how the reduction of transmission rates influences its decline. The paper makes use of the SIR (Susceptible Infected Recovered) Model which is a deterministic model used in the field of epidemiology-based on differential equations derived from sections of the population. The Basic Reproduction Number (R o ) represents the criticality of the epidemic in numeric terms. Forecasting an epidemic provides insights about the geographic spreading of the disease and the case incidences required to better inform intervention strategists about situations that may occur during the outbreak. Through this research paper, the authors wish to provide an insight into the impact of control measures on the pandemic. By drawing a comparison of three countries and their quarantine measures, observations on the decline of the outbreak are made. Authors intend to guide the intervention strategies of under-resourced countries like India and aid in the overall containment of the outbreak.",

The paper also defined the mean incubation period at 4 days. Of the 1099 patients, 926 patients were classified non severe and 173 patients were classified severe, on admission. The severe category of patients belonged to an older age group and had a higher prevalence of underlying illnesses as compared to non-severe patients.

In (9) the paper assumed that isolation could prevent transmission completely. Up to a 1000 simulations were run by considering varying values of Ro, total cases that existed initially etcetera. It considered two factors: infections resulting from a single individual and transmission that occurred before symptoms appeared. The research agreed that it is crucial to quickly follow the onset of symptoms by isolation. The isolation delay factor, as well as the number of cases to begin with, had a major influence in containing the outbreak. Subclinical infections might go unreported and cause a surge in transmissions. The SIR Model which was introduced for modeling influenza came forth in the early 1900s (10) . The paper (8) describes an extension of the SIR model with three new behavioral interventions-Q s , Q e , and Q i . Where Q s represents susceptible people that All rights reserved.

China started to work on identifying the novel virus and reported no new cases for the following 16 days. The number of cases rose to 62 in China on 20 th January. The government of Wuhan went ahead with the celebration of the Chinese New Year with 40,000 families on the very same day. The first case, outside Wuhan, was reported on 19 th January. The total number of cases increased to 548 on 22 nd January. During the first 20 days of January, very few quarantine measures were introduced and this led to more than 500 in less than 20 days. China did not act as strictly as was demanded by COVID-19 during its early stages. Wuhan (population : 11 million) being one of the most populous cities of China, did not help. Quarantine measures were introduced in Wuhan on 23 rd January 2020. Public transportation and outward bound flights and trains were suspended. The government of Wuhan advised citizens to use masks. Zhejiang, Guangdong, and Hunan announced the highest level of public health emergency; level 1. Various hospitals were assigned to receive patients suffering from fever of unknown cause. Wuhan began construction of special emergency hospitals to combat COVID-19. Every province in China had declared a level 1 public health emergency. Various tourist attractions and cinema halls were also closed. By 26 th January 2020, China began nationwide monitoring at airports, railway stations, bus stations and ports for testing and isolation of anyone infected. Wuhan suspended visa and passport services for Chinese citizens until 30 th January. Interprovincial transport was halted in some provinces. The percentage increase in cases was on a rise for the last 10 days of January (see Figure 5) due to the lack of quarantine measures during the early outbreak of the disease. Another reason could be the smaller measures that could have been implemented. For example, Schools in Beijing were closed until further notice on 26 th January 2020. But Beijing still wasn't on lock down. By the end of January various malls were shut all over China, but some malls in Wuhan, the epicenter of the outbreak, were still operating for shorter periods of time. At the end of January, the number of cases in China were almost 10,000, most of them from Wuhan, Hubei with 200 deaths. This highlights the fact that China should have introduced quarantine measures sooner, not only to control its spread within China, but also to other countries.February was marked by a decrease in the rate at which individuals were being infected and an increase in the recovering populationFigure 6. To contain COVID-19, Hubei implemented a stern policy which only allowed shop workers and one individual per household to be outside, All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission.",

Quarantine zones, called red zones, prohibited people from traveling except for medical reasons. These red zones had various checkpoints to monitor the entry and exit of people. But there were multiple cases of people easily escaping these red zones. Other parts of Italy quarantined people traveling from Northern Italy for 14days.
