The ability to modify health outcomes varies then based upon how one's hand is played. It is thus of great interest to understand how these determinants associate with the emerging pandemic covid-19. To this end, we conducted a deep-dive analysis into this problem using a recently curated public dataset on covid-19 that connects infection spread over time to a rich collection of contextual determinants for all counties of the U.S and Washington, D.C. Using random forest machine learning methodology, we identified a relevant constellation of contextual factors of disease spread which manifest differently for urban and rural counties. The findings also have clear implications for better preparing for the next wave of disease.",

Many of these are often classified under the umbrella of social determinants of health that have been documented to influence the success or setbacks in steps to a successful public health emergency response [Morano and Holt, 2017] . Being able to do this at a local level like the county has significant implications for understanding how where you live influences disease spread, differences between rural and urban settings, and better planning for future anticipated waves of disease. In the absence of comprehensive geocoded patient level data where multilevel interactions can be assessed, the study of the area level influences alone on covid-19 spread is informative in its own right. In addition, with the realization that racial and ethnic minority groups are suffering disproportionately in the pandemic, social determinants of health (which are important contributors to health disparities) have garnered more attention.",

Since we expect these factors to interact in complex ways, we will employ random forests machine learning methodology [Breiman, 2001] for model fitting. We expect that our findings will help to inform more nuanced strategies for safely re-opening society at the local level. [Killeen et al., 2020] assembled the dataset under focus.

Both types of variables were excluded from the analysis. Our reasoning for this is that the state level information could muddle the mechanism for the individual counties since our goal is to discern the slopes specifically at this level. If the forest were to start grouping counties by data it would defeat the purpose of the analysis. As for the extrapolated values by population, this is a very strong assumption that will most likely overstate the resources available to rural counties. Furthermore, this again may cause the forest to group by state which we want to avoid, our point is to have it group by specifically county level characteristics thus giving us groups of similar counties that experience similar increases in infection rates.",

The technique takes advantage of base learner aggregation to develop a complex learner that has much improved prediction performance and fit on the data. In this case the base learners are CART trees [Breiman et al., 1984] but in order to prevent having the same tree appear multiple times in the forest, randomness is introduced to the learning procedure. This takes the form of both bootstrapping the observations for the training of each tree and random feature selection where the optimal split is not taken from all variables available but instead a randomly selected subset. This results in the trees being more independent of each other thus preventing the instability that is present in CART. The issue with CART tree is the balancing between bias and instability via tree depth, if the tree grows too deep, then it is likely have overfit the data (high instability) but will have low bias; while, if it grows too shallow, it will be more stable but have higher bias. Therefore by aggregating very deep and unstable trees random forest is able to obtain overall low bias and average away the instability of each tree thus giving us a very effective overall learner. We used the rfsrc function in R [Ishwaran and Kogalur, 2020] for fitting random forests. Growth curve slope estimates were treated as responses (y) and the 186 All rights reserved.

Random forest procedures default settings were utilized which included mtry of square root of p (i.e. the number of predictors). Additionally, the automatic imputation function that ran-domForestSRC [Ishwaran and Kogalur, 2020] was activated in order to avoid losing county information. The imputation procedure is built into the forest growing procedure and run all at once. We included imputation because if we were to run the model only on the complete data, we would have lost approximately one third of the counties with the biggest loss being in the rural counties.

The nursing home facilities although somewhat presented in the age demographics of the county, are important in their own right since they often served as sites of localized case clusters. Traffic flow or movement data would indicate the degree to which lockdown measures were being adhered to. Lastly, one missing confounding variable is the uneven use of testing across different regions of the country. This would clearly affect the confirmed infection count time series numbers.
