He used data of daily reported cases of COVID-19, from15 January to 29 February 2020. He founds that the epidemic peak in Japan could possibly reach the early-middle summer. (Roosa et al. b, 2020) forecast the covid-19 epidemic in China over a short-term period using generalized logistic growth model, the Richards growth model, and a sub-epidemic wave model. They employed data of cumulative confirmed cases between January 22, 2020 and February 9, 2020. They found that the epidemic has reached saturation in Hubei and other provinces of China.. ( Hamidouche, 2020) introduce the Alg-COVID-19 Model to predict cumulative cases of COVID-19 in Algeria..This model allows predicting the incidence and the reproduction number R0 in the coming months.

Following (Kuniya, 2020) we suggest that a strict containment strategy is needed in Algeria, over a relatively long period, to reduce the epidemic size.",
