We combine demographic and health data for ethnic groupings in Aotearoa New Zealand with international data on IFR for different age groups to estimate inequities in IFR by ethnicity. We find that, if age is the dominant factor determining IFR, estimated IFR for M\u0101ori is around 50% higher than non-M\u0101ori. If underlying health conditions are more important than age per se, then estimated IFR for M\u0101ori is more than 2.5 times that of New Zealand European, and estimated IFR for Pasifika is almost double that of New Zealand European. IFRs for M\u0101ori and Pasifika are likely to be increased above these estimates by racism within the healthcare system and other inequities not reflected in official data. IFR does not account for differences among ethnicities in COVID-19 incidence, which could be higher in M\u0101ori and Pasifika as a result of crowded housing and higher intergenerational contact rates. These factors should be included in future disease incidence modelling. The communities at the highest risk will be those with elderly populations, and M\u0101ori and Pasifika communities, where the compounded effects of underlying health conditions, socioeconomic disadvantage, and structural racism result in imbricated risk of contracting COVID-19, becoming unwell, and death.",

Reported fatality rates vary widely between different populations and regions from 0.25% to over 3% (CDC, 2020; China CDC, 2020; Ferguson 2020; Mizumoto 2020; Wilson 2020; World Health Organisation, 2020) . At least two different measures of fatality rate exist: the infection fatality rate (IFR, ratio of fatalities to total infections) and the case fatality rate (CFR, ratio of fatalities to clinical cases). The IFR can be significantly lower than the CFR if there is a large proportion of subclinical infections. Obtaining accurate estimates of both the CFR or IFR can be difficult, particularly in the early stages of an epidemic. One reason for this is the difficulty in ascertaining the true number of infections. Testing during an epidemic tends to focus on clinically severe cases, which may bias estimates of fatality rates upwards. Conversely, there is a lag time between onset of symptoms and clinical outcome, which may lead to underreporting of fatalities (Verity et al, 2020) . Another reason for variation is that fatality rates depend on factors such as age, pre-existing health conditions, and availability of healthcare including ICU beds and ventilators. Using data from 37 countries, stratified by age and adjusted for under-reporting and for the lag from onset to clinical outcomes, Verity et al (Verity 2020 ) estimated the CFR to be 1.4% and the IFR to be 0.7%.",

We combine international data on infection fatality rates (IFR) from Verity et al (Verity 2020) with demographic and health data, by ethnicity, for Aotearoa New Zealand. We use these data to produce estimates of the inequity in IFR for M\u0101ori, Pacific and NZ European by age and accounting for major comorbidities. We adjust our estimates to account for the fact that, although M\u0101ori and Pacific populations are structurally younger than other ethnic groups in New Zealand, they have shorter life expectancy and higher rates of premature death than non-M\u0101ori at all ages. Mortality rates for older M\u0101ori are shaped by their life course, which includes increased exposure to infectious disease and conditions affecting respiratory function (Yon 2014). In addition, we adjust for ethnic inequities in unmet healthcare need, which captures some of the existing structural biases and racism within the healthcare system (Waitangi Tribunal, 2019; Robson 2007) . We discuss other factors, not reflected in official data, which could further increase IFR for high risk communities.",

In addition, IFR is an important input for mathematical models of COVID-19 spread and mortality.

Given the speed at which COVID-19 can potentially spread, there is an urgent need to prepare healthcare services and to put in place measures to protect at-risk groups. To address this, we use a simplified and approximate methodology, which contains numerous limitations (see Discussion). There are also shortcomings in the data on which our estimates are based, which make it difficult to disentangle the effects of age and comorbidity. We also acknowledge the inherent problems with using IFR as a measure of fatality. As such, our results should be used as an initial guide to the potential scale of COVID-19 inequity in Aotearoa New Zealand, and the absolute values of the estimated IFRs should be viewed through the lens of Verity et al (Verity 2020 Adjusting for life expectancy. M\u0101ori typically experience adverse health outcomes at an earlier age than non-M\u0101ori (Ministry of Health NZ, 2019b). To reflect this, we adjusted the age-specific IFR estimates of Verity et al (2020) by the most recent (2012-14) estimates of life expectancy for each ethnicity (StatsNZ 2020). This approach is consistent with international evidence that COVID-19 mortality is approximately proportional to total mortality, meaning that COVID-19 amplifies existing risk of mortality evenly for different groups (Spiegelhalter 2020) . The gap in life expectancy is different for male and female, and for different age groups. However, for simplicity, we used an average of the male and female life expectancy gap for the youngest age cohort. For example, average life expectancy for M\u0101ori is approximately 8.6% less than for non-M\u0101ori. We allowed for this by assuming that, all else being equal, M\u0101ori of age experience the same IFR as non-M\u0101ori who are 8.6% older. We calculated the IFR for age group , adjusted for the life expectancy of ethnicity group j, as follows:",

Therefore, taking an agestructured IFR and adjusting for comorbidity from age-correlated conditions will result in some over-accounting of the effect of age-related health conditions. Similarly, separately adjusting for differences in life expectancy and prevalence of comorbid conditions will also result in some over-accounting. Conversely, ignoring age structure and only accounting for variations in prevalence of the selected health conditions may ignore some age-related effects, for example from conditions that are not in the dataset or age effects that are not linked to a specific health condition (see also Discussion).",

The current modelling has been limited to the list of conditions included in the study from China CDC (2020) . The data from which the baseline IFRs are calculated are adjusted for under-reporting, bias towards testing more severe cases, and lag time from onset to clinical outcome (Verity 2020) . Nevertheless, there may be other biases and sources of inaccuracy not accounted for. We assumed in our model that the overall IFR was fixed at 0.87%, but there may be country-specific variations in IFR, and potentially higher IFRs in countries with large ethnic minority or Indigenous populations.

The methodology we have used makes relatively crude adjustments to IFRs based on differences in life expectancy, unmet primary healthcare need, and prevalence of comorbid conditions. This methodology should be refined over time, particularly as more data become available on COVID-19 cases in New Zealand. An alternative approach would be to use standardised metrics such as disability-adjusted life year (DALY) and years lost due to disability (YLD) to infer IFRs by age and ethnicity in New Zealand from the Chinese data. This approach should be tested, however it is possible that the true magnitude of inequities are not captured in these metrics and the data on which they are based, so there is a risk that this approach will underestimate the health burden for M\u0101ori and Pasifika.",

M\u0101ori and Pasifika have younger populations, but lower life expectancy, higher unmet healthcare need and higher prevalence of relevant underlying conditions such as diabetes and asthma. These factors have opposing effects on the IFR and it is difficult to predict whether age, or other covarying factors, will end up being more important. There is, as yet, little direct evidence to distinguish these effects for COVID-19. However, regardless of whether age or co-morbidities are the dominant factor influencing IFR, M\u0101ori will be worse off than NZ European/other. If age is the dominant variable, we estimate that the IFR for M\u0101ori will be about 50% higher than that for non-M\u0101ori. On the other hand, if underlying health conditions (which correlate with age) are more important, M\u0101ori could experience an IFR more than 2.5 times higher than that of NZ European, and Pasifika could experience an IFR around 30% higher than NZ European (first section of Table  5 ). M\u0101ori are more likely to experience multimorbidity and if the effect of multiple underlying health conditions is worse than simply multiplicative as assumed here, this will increase the IFR for M\u0101ori. These disparities could be wider still if differences in age-specific health outcomes and unmet healthcare need are larger than captured in official data (discussed below). Hospitalisation and fatality rates for M\u0101ori and Pasifika in the H1N1 influenza epidemic of 2009 were significantly higher than for NZ European (Verrall 2010; Wilson 2012 is the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.",

This will make access to healthcare increasingly difficult and necessitate decisions by practitioners about who gets access to care. This will almost certainly amplify existing racism in the healthcare system. For example, if triage decisions are based on existence of underlying health conditions, this will automatically disadvantage M\u0101ori further.

This is especially important in specific regions or communities with a relatively old population, which is likely to be one of the biggest factors affecting hospitalisation rates, ICU demand and fatality rates. For example, rural M\u0101ori have an older age distribution than M\u0101ori as a whole. Rural areas and particularly rural M\u0101ori communities may also have higher unmet healthcare need and less access to hospitallevel care, so this could be a particularly high-risk group. Reported IFRs for COVID-19 do not capture indirect impacts of COVID-19, for example deaths that are attributed to underlying conditions, such as heart disease, but were precipitated or hastened by COVID-19 infection. These indirect impacts are likely to also fall disproportionately on M\u0101ori and Pasifika peoples due to their higher prevalence of comorbid conditions. A report from the United Kingdom suggests black, Asian and other ethnic minority groups are more at-risk from COVID-19 than white majority groups (ICNARC, 2020). These at-risk communities have higher prevalence than white British groups of underlying health conditions, and are more likely to live in overcrowded households (UK Government 2018) and multi-generational households. Early reports emerging from the United States also suggest similar trends, where African-American communities are bearing a disproportionate health burden by COVID-19, thought to be related to pre-existing health conditions (e.g. (IDPH 2020)). These minority groups also have relatively young age structure (UK Government 2018). Similar factors apply to M\u0101ori in New Zealand and this reinforces the importance of accounting for factors specific to ethnicity groups. The methodology we have used here is a first attempt at addressing this, rather than crudely using age structure alone to estimate IFR. Data on COVID-19 incidence and outcomes stratified by ethnicity, or within the context of ethnic minority or Indigenous populations that experience disparities in health and healthcare, is currently scarce. Making robust comparisons and informing interventions to eliminate inequitable outcomes requires not only more data, but data that is accessible to decision makers in a timely fashion.

            "text": "The data and results in this report only look at the infection fatality rate, i.e. the ratio of deaths to infections, in each ethnicity group. This does not account for potential ethnic differences in transmission and infection, and therefore the proportion of each ethnicity group that becomes infected. Risk factors for heightened transmission include crowded housing, which affects around 25% of M\u0101ori and around 45% of Pacific people (Schluter 2007; StatsNZ, 2018) . In addition, multi-generation households increase the risk of transmission to older groups. These compounding factors mean that M\u0101ori and Pacific peoples are at higher risk of bearing a disproportionate burden of COVID-19 sickness, hospitalisation, on-going health effects, and fatality. A comprehensive analysis of these factors is outside the scope of this work. It will be critical to incorporate these into disease transmission models that are used to inform Aotearoa New Zealand's COVID-19 response (James 2020 ). This will enable the combined effect of incidence and IFR to be more accurately predicted and to inform effective strategies that recognise the diversity of higher risk groups and regions.",
