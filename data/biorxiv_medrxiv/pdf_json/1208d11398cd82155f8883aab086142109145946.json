Individuals infected with HIV-1 encoding defective nef genes do not develop AIDS for decades 2,3 . A key target of Nef is the cellular receptor CD4. Although essential for viral entry into host cells, CD4 is problematic for the virus later in its replication cycle: CD4 disrupts processing of the viral glycoprotein, Env, inhibiting 25 infectivity 4 ; it interferes with the release of new virions 5,6 ; and it causes vulnerability to superinfection, causing premature cell death and limiting viral productivity 7 . Furthermore, binding of CD4 to Env exposes otherwise-concealed Env epitopes, rendering infected cells more susceptible to antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity and virus particles more susceptible to neutralizing antibodies 8-10 . HIV-1 has evolved strategies to mitigate these 30 problems. Newly synthesized CD4 is targeted in the endoplasmic reticulum by the viral Vpu protein for proteasomal degradation 11 . Surface-expressed CD4, in contrast, is targeted by Nef for endocytosis and lysosomal degradation 12-15 . Nef's effect on CD4 involves hijacking of clathrin adaptor complex 2 (AP2)-dependent endocytosis 16,17 . Although how Nef associates with a part of the tetrameric AP2 is understood 18 , a complete understanding 35 of the interaction, especially how CD4 is sequestered by Nef into a complex with AP2, has remained elusive. Here, we present a high-resolution crystal structure that describes the underlying mechanism. An intricate combination of conformational changes occurs in both Nef and AP2 to enable CD4 binding and downregulation. Strikingly, a pocket on Nef",

We fused the cytoplasmic domain of CD4 (CD4CD) to the C-terminus of Nef via a 36 amino acid-long, flexible linker (Fig. 5 1a). Instead of using the full length CD4 tail (394-433), we included only residues 394 to 419, containing all the CD4 determinants reportedly required for Nef-mediated downregulation 13,19,20 . Since Nef residues within the N-terminal amphipathic helix are dispensable for CD4 downregulation 21 , we truncated 25 amino acids from the Nef N-terminus. We engineered the tetrameric AP2 complex by removing the mobile C-terminal domain of the \u03bc2 subunit (136-423), 10 enabling AP2 to adopt an open conformation in which its cargo binding sites are accessible. Binding between the Nef-CD4CD fusion protein and the modified AP2 construct (AP2 \u0394\u03bc2-CTD ) was confirmed in a GST pulldown assay (Fig. 1b) .",

The association is mainly hydrophobic and involves three CD4 residues: Ile410, Leu413, and Leu414 (Fig. 2a) . The dileucine motif of CD4 -Leu413/414 -is within a short helix. Leu414 and Ile410 dip into a 25 hydrophobic pocket of Nef formed by Phe121, Trp124, Met79, Thr138, and Pro78 (Fig. 2b) . Leu413 of CD4 sits just outside of that pocket and is accommodated by Nef residues Phe121, Leu37, Asn52, and Cys55 (Fig. 2b) . Nef residue Asp123 contributes to CD4 binding by hydrogen-bonding with the backbone nitrogen of CD4 Leu413 and supports the helix-turn of CD4 (Fig. 2b) . These structural findings explain previously observed roles of CD4 residues -the 30 dileucine motif and Ile410 13,20,22 -as well as Nef residues F121, D123, and Trp124 23,24 . To further confirm the structural model, we tested the mutations F121D, D123R, M79D, and T138D for their effects on CD4 surface-downregulation. The Nef mutants F121D and D123R were expressed similarly to the wild type but were unable to downregulate CD4 (Fig. 2ef) . The M79D and T138D Nef mutants were relatively poorly expressed, but dose-response experiments 35 suggested that this was insufficient to explain their functional defects ( Fig. 2ef and Extended Data Fig. 1 ).",

The part of the loop immediately connected to the rigid core of Nef, residues Phe68 to Pro75, wraps around the core. N-terminally, the loop then takes a sharp 40 \"U-turn\", placing a short helix at the interface between the Nef core and the \u03b1 subunit of AP2. Two residues within this helix, Trp57 and Leu58, fit into a hydrophobic pocket formed mainly by Nef residues: Leu112, Pro122, Phe121, and Tyr115 (Fig. 2d) . Lys298 of \u03b1, with its head group stabilized by Nef Asp111 through charge-charge interactions, also contacts Nef Trp57 via its hydrocarbon chain (Fig. 2d ). The Nef acidic cluster (Glu62-65), located in the \"U-turn\" region, does not contribute to CD4-binding, consistent with previous functional observations 16, 25, 26 . The Nef N-terminal loop extends to contact the CD4 tail (Fig. 2c ). This part of Nef, residues Cys55 to Val33, forms a wall-like structure to support CD4-binding. Here, contacts are made by several Nef residues with the short helical turn of CD4 and flanking residues. Overall, this conformation of the Nef N-terminal loop explains the crucial roles of 5 Trp57, Leu58, Leu112, Tyr115, and Pro122 in CD4-downregulation 16,17,21,23,27 (Fig. 2ef) as well as the cooperativity in the three-way binding between CD4CD, Nef and the \u03b1/\u03c32 hemicomplex of AP2 28 . Nef residues 41-46 are disordered with most of their electron density missing (Fig. 2c , dotted line). The density used for modeling Nef 34-40 is significant, but isolated and less welldefined, yielding a degree of uncertainty in the structural assignment for this region (Extended 10 Data Fig. 2) . We challenged the assignment by mutating Leu37 to Asp, as the model predicts that Leu37 directly contacts CD4 Leu413 (Fig. 2b) . This mutation abolished CD4 downregulation (Extended Data Fig. 1) , supporting the structural assignment and the role of Leu37 in CD4 downregulation.",

Here, disuccinimidyl sulfoxide (DSSO), a MS-cleavable, bifunctional amine-reactive small molecule, was used to cross-link proximal Lys residues or Ntermini of the Nef-CD4CD fusion and AP2 \u0394\u03bc2-CTD complex. Cross-linked proteins separated by SDS-PAGE were trypsin digested and resulting peptides analyzed by specialized LC-MS 3 30 experiments for identification of cross-linked residues (Extended Data Fig. 4a ). Application of this pipeline to the complex identified intra-and inter-linked peptides corresponding to 90 unique cross-linked residues (Extended Data Table 2 , Extended Data Fig. 4b ). Lys residues from the displaced \u03b22 \u039d-terminal domain (1-88) are involved in a total of 24 cross-links (Extended Data Table 2 , bold entries). Importantly, most of these cross-links are made by Lys residues 35 flanking the first helix (i.e. Lys5, 11, 12, 26, and 27), consistent with this helix binding specifically in the complex. In contrast, Lys residues from the other dislocated \u03b22 \u039d-terminal helices (i.e. Lys29, 31, 35, 36, 45, 66, 67, 78) are rarely observed, consistent with a lack of fixed residence within the complex. The XL-MS data, which captures structural information from a conformationally heterogeneous population of protein complexes as they exist in solution, the 40 crystal structure, and other structural information (methods) were used for integrative modeling 30 to produce a model ensemble which describes the complex in full (Extended Data Fig. 4c ). Segments that are disordered in the crystal structure are modeled and represented as helices or flexible strings of beads (Extended Data Fig. 4c ). The model ensemble agrees satisfactorily with the observed cross-links (89% of cross-links are satisfied, Extended Data Fig. 4d ).

            "text": "Binding of the first helix of \u03b22 to the Nef core in the current structure closely resembles how the N-terminal amphipathic helix of Nef (deleted from the construct used herein) binds the same location when Nef hijacks AP1 for MHC-I downregulation (Fig. 3d) 31 . That interaction, 5 mediated by Nef Trp13 and Met20, is critical for MHC-I downregulation but is dispensable for CD4 downregulation 21,31,32 . Our current structure indicates that intramolecular association of this Nef helix with the Nef core would force the Nef N-terminal loop to deviate from the conformation associated with CD4-binding (Extended Data Fig. 5 ). We suspect that this is an intricate plot of the virus: Nef binding forces the N-terminal helices of \u03b22 to destabilize and 10 unfold. By providing a binding-site for the first \u03b22 helix on its core, Nef provides partial compensation for this destabilization. Moreover, the N-terminal \u03b22 helix is now used to compete the Nef amphipathic helix off the core, freeing the N-terminal loop of Nef to adopt the conformation shown in Figure 2c for CD4 downregulation. A potential caveat to this hypothesis is that mutations of Nef residues F90, L97, L100, I109, W113, and I114, which line the binding 15 site on the Nef-core for the \u03b22 helix, have minimal effects on the downregulation of CD4 (Fig. 2 , Extended Data Fig. 1 and 6 ). However, since these mutations likely affect the binding of the \u03b22 helix and the Nef N-terminal amphipathic helix similarly, they might have minimal influence on the competition between these two helices for the Nef core in vivo, consistent with their lack of effects on CD4 downregulation. In contrast, and consistent with the model above, mutations of 20 this site affect the downregulation of class I MHC (Extended Data Fig. 7) ; alanine substitution of L100 together with I109 is particularly informative: this mutation yields a well-expressed Nef that cannot downregulate class I MHC yet downregulates CD4.",

For MHC-I downregulation, Nef interacts solely with the \u03bc1 subunit and exploits the conserved Tyr-based motif-binding site on AP1 31 . For CD4 downregulation, Nef exploits the acidic dileucine-binding site on the a and \u03c32 subunits of AP2 and contacts all subunits except \u03bc2. Our models show that by allowing the N-terminal Nef helix and the N-terminal \u03b22 helix to bind the 30 same pocket on the core, Nef creates a \"molecular switch\" that links its use of different AP complexes with the modulation of different targets: binding to AP2 frees the N-terminus of Nef from the core to recruit CD4, whereas binding to AP1 leaves the core free to bind the N-terminus of Nef and thereby facilitates the recruitment of MHC-I.",

Each MC step consisted of a series of random transformations (ie, rotations and translations) of the positions of the beads and rigid bodies. The sampling produced 4,000,000 models from 80 independent runs. (4) Analyzing and validating the ensemble structures and data: Model validation follows four major steps 30,56 : 25 (i) Selection of the models for validation: The ensemble of models for further analysis was objectively defined as follows. For each trajectory, the MC step at which all data likelihoods and priors are equilibrated (run equilibration step) was computed and all prior frames were discarded 57 . Sampling of the Nef-CD4CD-AP2 \u0394\u03bc2-CTD complex yielded 2,007,800 representative structures that sufficiently satisfied the input restraints. 30 (ii) Estimation of sampling precision: The precision at which sampling sampled the selected structures (sampling precision) was estimated 56 . The sampling precision must be comparable or higher than the precision of the structure ensemble consistent with the input data (model precision). As a proxy for testing the thoroughness of sampling, we performed four sampling convergence tests as described 56 . We performed three sampling convergence tests: 1) verify that the scores of 35 refined structures do not continue to improve as more structures are computed. 2) Confirm that the selected structures in independent sets of sampling runs (Sample A and Sample B) satisfy the data equally well. The non-parametric Kolmogorov-Smirnov two-sample test (two sided) indicates that the difference between the two score distributions is insignificant (p-value (0.08)>0.05). In addition, the magnitude of the difference is small, as demonstrated by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov 40 two-sample test statistic (D=0.02). 3) Cluster the structural models and determine the sampling precision at which the structural features can be interpreted. Three criteria were used for determining the sampling precision, evaluated as a function of the RMSD clustering threshold. First, the p-value is computed using the \u03c72-test (one-sided) for homogeneity of proportions. Second, an effect size for the \u03c72-test is quantified by the Cramer's V value. Third, the population 45 of structures in sufficiently large clusters (containing at least ten structures from each sample).",

The output of this protocol is a single distinct cluster containing the majority (96%) of the individual models. The sampling precision is defined as the average bead RMSD between the models within the cluster and its corresponding centroid in the finest clustering for which each 5 sample contributes models proportionally to its size (considering both significance and magnitude of the difference) and for which a sufficient proportion of all models occur in sufficiently large clusters. The sampling precision for our integrative model is 13.5\u00c5. (iii) Estimation of model precision: The most explicit description of model uncertainty is provided by the set of all models that are sufficiently consistent with the input information (i.e. the 10 ensemble).

The ensemble satisfies 89% of the XLs used to compute it, including all of the Nef XLs (Extended Data Fig. 4) . The unsatisfied crosslinks mostly span residues between CD4CD and the NTD's of the \u03b1 and \u03b22 subunits (Extended Data Table 2 ). These violations can be rationalized as non-specific interactions between CD4CD and the AP2 complex when CD4CD is not 20 bound to Nef in solution, false-positive crosslinks, sample heterogeneity, insufficient conformational sampling, and coarse-grained representation of the modeled components. The remaining restraints, including structural equivalence, excluded volume, and sequence connectivity restraints, are also satisfied within their uncertainties.",
