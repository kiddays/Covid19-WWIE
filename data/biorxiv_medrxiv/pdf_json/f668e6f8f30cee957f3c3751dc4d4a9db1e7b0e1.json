            "text": "The COVID-19 crisis has shown that classic sequential models for scientific research are too slow and do not easily encourage multidisciplinary scientific collaboration. The need to rapidly understand the causes of differing infection outcomes and vulnerabilities, to provide mechanistic frameworks for the interpretation of experimental and clinical data and to suggest drug and therapeutic targets and to design optimized personalized interventions all require the development of detailed predictive quantitative models of all aspects of COVID-19. Many of these models will require the use of common submodels describing specific aspects of infection ( e.g. , viral replication) but combine them in novel configurations. As a contribution to this development and as a proof-of-concept for some components of these models, we present a multi-layered 2D multiscale, multi-cell model and associated computer simulations of the infection of epithelial tissue by a virus, the proliferation and spread of the virus, the cellular immune response and tissue damage. Our initial, proof-of-concept model is built of modular components to allow it to be easily extended and adapted to describe specific viral infections, tissue types and immune responses. Immediately after a cell becomes infected, the virus replicates inside the cell. After an eclipse period, the infected cells start shedding diffusing infectious virus, infecting nearby cells, and secretes a short-diffusing cytokine signal. Neighboring cells can take up the diffusing extracellular virus and become infected. The cytokine signal calls for immune cells from a simple model of the systemic immune response. These immune cells chemotax and activate within the tissue in response to the cytokine profile. Activated immune cells can kill underlying epithelial cells directly or by secreting a short-diffusible toxic chemical. Infected cells can also die by apoptosis due to the stress of viral replication. We do not include direct cytokine mediated protective factors in the tissue or distinguish the complexity of the immune response in this simple model. Despite unrealistically fast viral production and immune response, the current base model allows us to define three parameter regimes, where the immune system rapidly controls the virus, where it controls the virus after extensive tissue damage, and where the virus escapes control and infects and kills all . : bioRxiv preprint / cells. We can simulate a number of drug therapy concepts, like delayed rate of production of viral RNAs, reduced viral entry, and higher and lower levels of immune response, which we demonstrate with simulation results of parameter sweeps of select model parameters. From results of these sweeps, we found that successful containment of infection in simulation directly relates to inhibited viral internalization and rapid immune cell recruitment, while spread of infection occurs in simulations with fast viral internalization and slower immune response. In contrast to other simulations of viral infection, our simulated tissue demonstrates spatial and cellular events of viral infection as resulting from subcellular, cellular, and systemic mechanisms. To support rapid development of current and new submodels, we are developing a shared, publicly available environment to support collaborative development of this framework and its components. We warmly invite interested members of the biological, medical, mathematical and computational communities to contribute to improving and extending the framework.",

            "text": "Betacoronavirus Life Cycle Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is an enveloped virus with a positive sense, single stranded RNA genome (ssRNA+). ssRNA + viruses have mutation rates that are millions of times higher than that of their hosts [1] .This characteristic allows ssRNA + viruses to have enhanced virulence and evolution rates, which makes this particular category of virus complex [2, 3] . The genomic evolutionary history of SARS-CoV-2 shows lower / Viral Replication Viral replication of SARS-CoV-2 and other enveloped single stranded positive sense RNA viruses occurs within the cytoplasm of host epithelial cells after unpacking of viral proteins from the internalized particle [30] . An RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) encoded within the virus genome produces a negative strand from positive host RNA strand by hijacking host epithelial cell translation machinery. The negative viral RNA strand is then used to produce more positive RNA strands and smaller positive strand subgenomic sequences [31] . Subgenomic sequences are translated to produce viral proteins [31] . After replication inside the host, viral positive RNA strands and viral proteins are transported to the Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER) where they are assembled to form new virions. New virions are then packaged into vesicles and transported to the cell membrane for release into the extracellular environment through the continuous process of viral budding [32] [33] [34] . The yield for newly produced virions is not clearly defined in SARS-CoV-2 as it is with lytic viruses [35] . The main regulation of the viral replication process occurs at the replication stage, because the balance between replication and translation must be carefully maintained in order to achieve maximum rates of replication and translation without exhaustion of host cell resources [33, 34] .",

            "text": "Triggering Innate Immune Response The innate immune system is the first response to encounter SARS-CoV-2 infection. Production of SARS-CoV-2 viral proteins interfere with various host cell metabolic, regulatory and delivery pathways [36, 37] . The detection of foreign viral proteins and the hijacking of host cell translation machinery triggers immune system gene expression [38] . This triggered genetic expression signals the production of type I interferons (IFNs), cytokines, chemokines, interleukins, myeloids, and small molecule RNA signals through a series of toll-like receptors (TLRS) [39] . This process occurs in order to alert local cell populations of infection through small molecule signaling and to stimulate the growth and recruitment of immune cells [40] . The immune cells that are targeted for early activation in the innate immune response are dendritic cells, macrophages, neutrophils, mast cells, basophils, eosinophils, leukocytes, and natural killer (NK) cells [28] . The stimulated activation of immune cells such as macrophages and monocytes interplays the recruitment, initiation, and maturation of NK cells and naive T cells from stem cells in bone marrow to the site of local infection [40] . Simultaneously, programmed cell death (apoptosis) is initiated in cells with hijacked translation machinery through caspase activation and through contact with NK cells [41] [42] [43] . After immune cell recruitment, mature monocytes, macrophages, and T cell populations begin to deal with cells infected by virus by direct killing [44] [45] [46] . This initial innate immune response that takes place within hours and days of infection involves multiple signaling molecules acting upon multiple complex signaling pathways [47, 48] . Cytokines produced in this time period are associated with early clinical symptoms of viral infection such as fever, fatigue, and cough [49] .",

Non-dimensionalization was performed on all available model parameters in the literature for a lattice dimension of 4 \u03bcm per pixel along each dimension, at 120 s per MCS. For remaining model parameters, parameter estimation was performed such that, for the baseline set of parameters, spread of infection occurred throughout the domain by approximately the end of the simulation time. All parameter sets were simulated for ten trials, each consisting of 1,000 MCSs. Simulation data was collected at a frequency of 10 MCSs for all simulations, including the total number of all cell types, the total number of activated immune cells, the total diffusive virus and cytokine, and the value of the immune response signal ( ), S Two parameter sweeps were performed for submodel parameters of interest. In the first set, the virus-receptors affinity association and immune response delay coefficient k on \u03b2 delay were varied. In the second parameter sweep, the replication rate was varied. For all r max variations, the baseline coefficient was multiplied by a factor in the set 10 -2 , 10 -1 , 10 0 , 10 1 , 10 2 . As such, the first parameter sweep consisted of 25 parameter sets, and the second parameter sweep consisted of 5 parameter sets, for a total of 300 total simulations.
