To date, there are no approved antiviral drugs for the specific treatment of human coronavirus infections. However, several drugs are being used in the frontline of clinical management of SARS-CoV-2-infected individuals in hospitals all around the world, to avoid the development of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19)-associated pneumonia, which can be fatal. Currently, different drug regimens are being applied, but no clinical study has evidenced their efficacy yet. Under this scenario, initiatives launched by the World Health Organization (WHO), such as the SOLIDARITY study that will compare Remdesivir, Hydroxychloroquine, Ritonavir/Lopinavir and Ritonavir/Lopinavir plus \u00df-interferon regimes, are of critical importance to prioritize the use of the most active compounds. As already envisioned in the SOLIDARITY trial, the most effective antiviral therapies are usually based on combined therapies that tackle distinct steps of the viral life cycle. These combinations may be critical to reduce the emergence of drug resistant viruses and to potentiate antiviral activity, enhancing their chances to improve clinical outcome.",

Yet, given the urgent situation we are facing and the fact that all the compounds we tested are already clinically approved, we report our ongoing experiments in the most expedited manner for the scientific community, clearly stressing the limitations of these preliminary data. In addition, it is also important to highlight that in vitro efficacy does not always translate into clinical efficacy, so even if replication studies confirm the results we are obtaining, well-designed and controlled clinical trials are needed to assess safety, efficacy and tolerability of any antiviral treatment or combination described herein. Assessing antiviral activity and safety in relevant animal models could be key to identify and advance those compounds with the highest potential to succeed in clinical trials. Thus, this project will produce a list of effective compounds with proven antiviral efficacy in vitro to halt SARS-CoV-2 replication, focusing on those that are already clinically approved for humans. In turn, this information could guide future clinical trials and offer a potential therapeutic benefit to individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2.",

Interference with either of these initial processes has proven to decrease SARS-CoV-2 entry and infectivity (Hoffmann et al., 2020; Monteil et al., 2020) . In addition, once SARS-CoV-2 accumulates in endosomes, cellular cathepsins can also prime viral Spike protein cleavage and favor viral fusion. Hence, we first tested compounds that could have an effect before viral entry by impairing viral-cell fusion ( Table 1) . Given its wide clinical use worldwide, we first confirmed the inhibitory effect of hydroxychloroquine (Dolquine\u00ae) on SARS-CoV-2 induced cellular cytotoxicity . A constant concentration of a SARS-CoV-2 stock sequenced upon isolation (accession ID EPI_ISL_418268 at GISAID repository: http://gisaid.org) was mixed with decreasing concentrations of hydroxychloroquine and added to Vero E6 cells.

As shown in Fig. 1A , this drug was able to inhibit viral-induced cytopathic effects (red lines) at concentrations where no cytotoxic effects of the drug were observed (grey lines). The mean concentration of this drug that inhibited cytotoxicity at 50% (mean IC 50 value) was 1.27 \u00b1 0.7 \u00b5M. These results aligned with previous reports highlighting the in vitro inhibitory capacity of chloroquine derivatives Wang et al., 2020) and their preliminary benefit observed in a very small cohort of patients (Gautret et al., 2020) that should be confirmed in the ongoing large-scale randomized SOLIDARITY trial. Since hydroxychloroquine is being administered in combination with the antibiotic azithromycin (Gautret et al., 2020) , which induces anti-viral responses in bronchial epithelial cells (Gielen et al., 2010) , we further tested the activity of this compound (Zytromax\u00ae) in our assay. However, in the Vero E6 model, azithromycin did not show any antiviral effect (Fig. 1B) , and the combination of hydroxychloroquine with azithromycin had a similar activity as the chloroquine derivative alone (Fig. 1C) .",

Indeed, clathrin-mediated endocytosis is one of the potential mechanisms by which hydroxychloroquine may exert its therapeutic effect against SARS-CoV-2 . One of these compounds was Amantadine, licensed against influenza A virus infections and as a treatment for Parkinson's disease, which blocks coated pit invagination at the plasma membrane (Phonphok and Rosenthal, 1991) . In addition, we also tested Chlorpromazine, an antipsychotic drug that inhibits clathrin-mediated endocytosis by preventing the assembly and disassembly of clathrin networks on cellular membranes or endosomes (Wang et al., 1993) . When we assessed the antiviral efficacy of these clathrin inhibitors against SARS-CoV-2, we did not find any prominent effect, only a partial inhibition at 100 \u07e4 M for Amantadine (Supp. Fig. 1 ). The broad cathepsin B/L inhibitor E64-d, which exerts activity against viruses cleaved by cellular cathepsins upon endosomal internalization, as is the case of Ebola virus (Gielen et al., 2010) , showed also partial inhibitory activity (Supp. Fig. 1) as already described for pseudotyped SARS-CoV-2 viruses (Hoffmann et al., 2020) .",

Remdesivir acts as an adenosine analogue that is incorporated into nascent viral RNA chains and results in premature termination (Warren et al., 2016) . Given its clinical safety proven during the last Ebola outbreak, Remdesivir is actually being assayed at the SOLIDARITY trial, and has shown efficacy in non-human primate animal models (Williamson et al., 2020) . Here we further confirmed its in vitro capacity to inhibit SARS-CoV-2-induced cytotoxicity at concentrations where no cytotoxic effects of the drug were observed ( Fig. 2A) . The mean IC 50 value of this drug was 0.85 \u00b1 0.41 \u00b5M. In combination with hydroxychloroquine, however, Remdesivir did not improve its own antiviral effect when added alone ( Fig. 2A) .

Vero E6 cells were cultured on a cell culture flask (25 cm 2 ) at 1,5 x 10 6 cells overnight prior to inoculation with 1 mL of the processed sample, for 1 h at 37\u00baC and 5% CO 2 . Afterwards, 4 mL of 2% FCS-supplemented DMEM were supplied and cells were incubated for 48 h. Supernatant was harvested, centrifuged at 200 x g for 10 min to remove cell debris and stored at -80\u00baC. Cells were assessed daily for cytopathic effect and the supernatant was subjected to viral RNA extraction and specific RT-qPCR using the SARS-CoV-2 UpE, RdRp and N assays (Corman et al., 2020) . Viral RNA was extracted directly from swab samples and from the isolate using the Nucleospin Virus kit (Macherey-Nagel, Duren, Germany) and transcribed to cDNA using the PrimeScript\u2122 RT reagent Kit (Takara, Japan) using oligo-dT and random hexamers, according to the manufacturer's protocol. DNA was then processed with Nextera kit (Illumina) and loaded on Illumina 300bp paired-end sequencing with MiSeq Sequencing platform. Sequence reads were quality filtered and mapped against coronavirus reference (NC_045512.2) using bowtie2 tool (Langmead et al., 2012) .",
