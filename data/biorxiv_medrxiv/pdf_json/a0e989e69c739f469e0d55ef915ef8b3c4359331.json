Most severe COVID-19 patients develop dyspnea or hypoxemia one week after the onset, and their lung is more serious and gas exchange cannot be performed. When ventilator cannot restore lung function, ECMO has become an effective treatment to rescue critical patients, but it is only temporarily replacing cardiopulmonary function, and there are still many complications. Among them, the coagulation systems disorder is still one of the most common complications of ECMO, which terminate the ECMO [27] [28] . Therefore, safe and scientific monitoring of the ECMO loop and thrombosis in patients, then early intervention can further reduce the harm of these complications to promote effective circulation support for ECMO. TAT, PIC, TM, and t-PAIC are the indicators of early prediction and monitoring of DIC, and DD is the indicator that a thrombus is occurring or ongoing. What's more, our findings demonstrated that the prediction of the t-PAIC .
