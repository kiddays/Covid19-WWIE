            "text": "The ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic is a serious threat to 25 global public health, and imposes severe burdens on the entire human society. The 26 severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) can cause 27 severe respiratory illness and death. Currently, there are no specific antiviral drugs 28 that can treat COVID-19. Several vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 are being actively 29 developed by research groups around the world. The surface S (spike) protein and the 30 highly expressed internal N (nucleocapsid) protein of SARS-CoV-2 are widely 31 considered as promising candidates for vaccines. In order to guide the design of an 32 effective vaccine, we need experimental data on these potential epitope candidates. In 33 this study, we mapped the immunodominant (ID) sites of S protein using sera samples 34 collected from recently discharged COVID-19 patients. The SARS-CoV-2 S protein-35 specific antibody levels in the sera of recovered COVID-19 patients were strongly 36 correlated with the neutralising antibody titres. We used epitope mapping to 37 determine the landscape of ID sites of S protein, which identified nine linearized B 38 cell ID sites. Four out of the nine ID sites were found in the receptor-binding domain 39 (RBD). Further analysis showed that these ID sites are potential high-affinity SARS-40 CoV-2 antibody binding sites. Peptides containing two out of the nine sites were 41 tested as vaccine candidates against SARS-CoV-2 in a mouse model. We detected 42 epitope-specific antibodies and SARS-CoV-2-neutralising activity in the immunised 43 mice. This study for the first time provides human serological data for the design of 44 vaccines against COVID-19.",

This phenomenon has restricted the development 82 of effective vaccines for influenza A and other highly variable viruses [17] [18] [19] . All the 83 methods used to overcome or manipulate these viral immunity restrictions rely on the 84 landscape of immunodominance. It is therefore crucial to map the immunogenicity 85 landscape of the potential epitopes of the S protein to accelerate the development of identified five linear immunodominant (ID) sites in the S protein that did not induce 92 neutralising antibodies. On the contrary, the RBD was found to contain the major 93 neutralising epitopes in the S protein, but did not have any ID sites 21 .",

The World Health 52 Organization has launched a worldwide clinical trial called SOLIDARITY to test 53 antiviral treatment options for the novel coronavirus, but as of April 15, 2020, there 54 are no specific drugs for treating COVID-19 1 . Many research teams worldwide are 55 racing to develop vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 to combat this novel coronavirus 56 pandemic. 57 Similar to other coronaviruses, SARS-CoV-2 is an enveloped positive-stranded RNA 58 virus with four major structural proteins: S (spike), E (envelope), M (membrane), and 59 N (nucleocapsid) proteins 2-4 . The surface S protein is the key that allows SARS-COV-60 2 to enter into cells 5 , as it plays a role in binding to the cellular receptor and 61 membrane fusion 5,6 . The SARS-CoV-2 shares 75.96% homology with the 2003 62 SARS-CoV 3 , and the structure and functional domains of the SARS-CoV-2 S protein 63 have already been identified 7 . The receptor-binding domain (RBD) within the S1 64 domain binds to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) to facilitate the entry of 65 SARS-CoV-2 into host cells 6,7 . 66 As of April 8, 2020, there are at least 115 vaccine candidates in active development 67 worldwide 8 . The SARS-CoV-2 S (spike) glycoprotein is the immunogen that is the 68 focus of the majority of the vaccine research. In the absence of in vivo and in vitro 69 data, researchers have been using in silico data based on the IEDB database or other 70 online epitope prediction algorithms 9-14 . However, the in silico data is less likely to be 71 useful for vaccine development, because these bioinformatics tools were not 72 optimised for vaccine design. Furthermore, the antigenic properties of S proteins 73 remain elusive, and therefore experimental immunogenic information is urgently 74 needed.",

To further investigate the correlations between 184 MN activity and anti-NP or anti-RBD IgG, IgM, and IgA titres, we carefully analysed 185 the sera from recovered patients. We found MN activity in the sera of 26 out of 39 186 COVID-19 patients. The MN titres were adjusted following previous criteria: MN 187 titres less than 10 were re-designated a value of 5 and MN titres greater than 320 were 188 re-designated a value of 640 22 . We identified a very strong correlation between anti-189 RBD IgG titres and MN activity in recovered patients (R 2 = 0.8009). The correlations 190 between anti-RBD IgM/IgA titres and MN activity were weaker than for IgG (R 2 = 191 0.5130 and 0.5926, respectively) (Figure 2E, G, I).

These correlations 193 dropped dramatically when MN activity titres were greater than 1:160 (Figure 2D, F, 194 H).

Each peptide 201 was between 20 and 25 residues in length with a five-residue overlap. We measured 202 ID sites in terms of the positive rate and the percentage of convalescent sera from 203 COVID-19 patients having positive reactions to the epitope. Here, we used the mean 204 response plus three times the standard deviation in healthy donors as the cut-off value 205 to define positive reactions. The epitope mapping showed nine linear ID sites on the Figure 3), with an average positive rate of \u226550% among all 39 patients. We found the 209 SARS-CoV-2 RBD contained four ID sites, IDd, IDe, IDf, and IDg, whereas the 210 SARS-CoV RBD has no ID sites. Considering the SARS-CoV-2 S protein shares 211 75.96% identity with the SARS-CoV S protein, we found five out of the nine 212 fragments, IDc (79.17%), IDd (90%), IDe (90%), IDh (79.2%), and IDi (96%) were 213 evolutionarily highly conserved in the SARS-CoV S protein. However, only three of 214 the nine ID sites, IDa (63.64%), IDh (79.05%), and IDi (96%) were highly 215 homologous (>50%) to SARS-CoV S protein ID sites. These results suggest that the 216 conserved regions contribute to the immunogenicity of the S protein, whereas the 217 majority of ID sites (6 out of 9) were less likely to be conserved. Interestingly, some 218 epitopes induced personalized immune responses in specific patients. Patient 33 had 219 an extremely strong immune response to epitope S (21-45) with a 40 times increase 220 compared to the cut-off value, whereas the responses of patients 26 to 31 were not 221 significantly different compared to those of healthy donors. A similar response was 222 also observed for S (281-305), which is less likely to be an ID site. (Figure 3A) These 223 results suggest that some unexpected ID sites of the S protein might lead to highly 224 variable immune responses in patients if immunised with certain viral proteins.",

Among ID sites with positive rates ranging from 50% to 60%, five sites were 248 located on the head region of the S protein and two sites were on the stem of the S 249 protein (Figure 5B). Among ID sites with positive rates over 60%, all five epitopes 250 were located on the head of the S protein (Figure 5C). Although the S protein is a 251 glycoprotein, glycosylation modification had limited effects on immunisation. Two252 glycosylation sites, N331 and N343, were observed in the RBD region, but these sites 253 had no influence on the immune response. In sera from patients, non-glycosylated 254 peptides were able to induce immune responses (Figure 3A, C and Figure 4G, S330-255 349). 256 The neutralising titre results (Figure 4F) suggest the ID sites have neutralising 257 activities against SARS-CoV-2, although the ID sites in SARS-CoV were unlikely to 258 be neutralising sites 20 . To further validate the ID sites, we compared the binding 259 residues of the S protein to reported monoclonal antibodies with the ID sites of 260 RBD 15,24,25 . Interestingly, some binding residues of SARS-CoV-2-specific 261 neutralising antibodies were highly similar to the ID sites (Figure 5).
