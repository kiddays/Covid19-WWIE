At the time of writing this paper, there were over two million reported cases worldwide and more than 130,000 deaths attributed to COVID19 acute infection (1) . Based on models of its spread, and potential for morbidity and mortality, most governments worldwide have adopted mitigation strategies that essentially limit social contacts (2, 3) . The goal of these measures is to \"flatten the curve\" of acute presentations so as to prevent widespread morbidity and the break-down of health care systems. Variants of these social mitigation strategies range from \"social distancing\", at-home-confinement-referred to as \"self-isolation\", to selective \"quarantine\", and to population \"lockdown\" that includes restriction of movement outdoors and closure of schools and all non-essential services and businesses.",

Negative mental health outcomes can be attributed to the emotional and physiological effects of the risk posed by the virus and by reduced physical activity, social interaction and human physical contact (5) (6) (7) . Studies on prior pandemics, such as the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS)found that the length of quarantine was an important predictor of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression and anxiety with a cumulative prevalence exceeding 30% of the population (8, 9) . Psychosocial stressors within families and loneliness for those living alone are also likely to spike in confinement and have adverse effects on mental and physical health (10) (11) (12) (13) . Available data suggest that stress associated with population-wide disasters increases the level of violence, including domestic violence and child abuse (14, 15) . These are recognised risk factors for mental health and substance abuse problems (16) as well as suicide (17) .",

This duration was chosen as it aligns with the expected duration of social mitigation in many countries. We use data from Switzerland as an example. The model focuses on what we consider to be the major contributors to YLL affecting the majority of the population, namely: suicide, emergence or increase in psychopathology, childhood physical abuse and continued restriction of movement and at home confinement.",

PRi: We extrapolated on the relationship between confinement and suicidality from data from the penitentiary system. Community cell-confined prisoners already have an increased suicide rate by factors between 3.5 and 21 compared to the general population (25, 26) . However, the risk of suicide for prisoners in single cells is further increased approximately 9 to 15 times (27) . Extrapolating from these data, we assume that confinement in the household increases their likelihood of suicide by a factor of 3 in multi-person households and a factor of 27 in single-person households (3*9). We assume this increase is stable for the entire 3-month duration. In Switzerland, 16% of the population live in single-households (28). These calculations result in a population-wide PRi of 6.84 (0.16*27 + 0.84*3).",

Causes for this may also include detrimental habits that individuals may adopt to cope with the stress, loss, and isolation (such as increased smoking (41)).

There are no data informing on the baseline number of deaths that can be attributed to social disconnection or loneliness. In response, we averaged the life-expectancy of men and women and calculated YLLi according to the following steps: 1) life expectancy by category was taken from the Federal Statistics office of Switzerland which gives remaining life expectancy at birth, 30, 50, 65 and 80 years of age. (51). 2) We then conservatively adjusted YLL for each age category as a very rough approximation. This approximation is -if anything-aimed at underestimating the remaining life expectancy (cat 1: 73.45, cat 2: 54.2, cat 3: 34.8, cat 4: 15.5, cat 5: 4.95). 3) Overall, remaining life expectancy was then multiplied with the percentage of deaths in each age group, leading to a cumulative YLLi =12.03 for each additional death.",
