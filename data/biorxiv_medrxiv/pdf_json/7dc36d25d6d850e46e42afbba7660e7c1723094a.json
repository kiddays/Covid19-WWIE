While many studies have focused on understanding the basic epidemiology of the disease, few open source tools have been made available to aid hospitals in their planning. We developed a web-based application (available at: http://covid19forecast.rush.edu/) for US states and territories that allows users to choose from a suite of models already employed in characterizing the spread of COVID-19. Users can obtain forecasts for hospital visits and admissions as well as anticipated needs for ICU and non-ICU beds, ventilators, and personal protective equipment supplies. Users can also customize a large set of inputs, view the variability in forecasts over time, and download forecast data. We describe our web application and its models in detail and provide recommendations and caveats for its use. Our application is primarily designed for hospital leaders, healthcare workers, and government official who may lack specialized knowledge in epidemiology and modeling. However, specialists can also use our open source code as a platform for modification and deeper study. As the dynamics of COVID-19 change, our application will also change to meet emerging needs of the healthcare community.",

By then, confirmed COVID-19 cases were reported among 109 countries and exceeded 128,000 worldwide (data source: Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering). That number increased more than 10-fold in less than one month. As COVID-19 spreads within and among nations, healthcare enterprises grapple with the challenges of preparing for the growing number of COVID-19 patients and with appropriating the resources needed to treat patients while protecting healthcare professionals. In the United States (US), policy makers and hospital leaders prognosticate on how to best allocate resources in the face of an anticipated surge in demand that may last for several months to come (Bukhari and Jameel, 2020) . However, even as COVID-19 threatens to overwhelm healthcare systems, the predictive analytics tools that would otherwise allow hospitals to make informed decisions are lagging behind the increasing number of studies aimed at characterizing the basic epidemiology of COVID-19.",

The exponential model has been widely used to characterize the spread of COVID-19 the during initial weeks of infection Because it assumes that r is constant, the exponential model has a simple log-linear transformation, log(Nt) = log(N0) + t \u00b7 r, that allows log-transformed numbers of cases to be regressed on t (Sit, Poulin-Costello, and Bergerud 1994). Our application uses this exponential regression to obtain predictions for the expected number of confirmed COVID-19 cases (N). This model has explained upwards of 99% of variation in the initial days or weeks of COVID-19 spread within states; however, it quickly begins to fail because it only allows for continued rapid growth (Fig 2) .",

The quadratic function, f(x) = x 2 + x + c, is a 2 nd order polynomial that can be applied to population growth as Nt = \u03b21t 2 + \u03b22t + N0.
