The different national governments have problems evaluating the reach of the epidemic, having limited resources and tests at their disposal. Hence, any means to evaluate the number of persons with symptoms compatible with COVID-19 with reasonable level of accuracy is useful. In this paper we present the initial results of the @CoronaSurveys project. The objective of this project is the collection and publication of data concerning the number of people that show symptoms compatible with COVID-19 in different countries using open anonymous surveys. While this data may be biased, we conjecture that it is still useful to estimate the number of infected persons with the COVID-19 virus at a given point in time in these countries, and the evolution of this number over time. We show here the initial results of the @CoronaSurveys project in Spain and Portugal.",

Official numbers of confirmed cases are periodically issued by each country's health authority. (For Portugal see [1] .) Unfortunately, upon the pandemic outbreak is it usually the case that there is lack of available laboratory tests, and other material and human resources. Hence, it is not possible to test all potential cases, and some eligibility criteria is applied to decide who is tested. Under these circumstances, the evolution of official confirmed cases might not represent the total number of cases (see [5] ).",

However, this metric is not using the actual number of cases with known outcomes, since recent cases will still evolve into fatalities and recoveries. By estimating the true number of cases with known outcomes, it is possible to obtain a corrected case fatality ratio (cCFR) that takes into account the average delay from symptoms to death, as in [6] . Since the corrected denominator (cases with known outcomes) is reduced, the cCFR is higher than the naive CFR during a growing outbreak. A high cCFR is typically an indicator of lack of coverage in laboratory testing. If we assume, in general, that the disease will have similar case fatality rates in different countries, it is possible to use the known fatality ratio from Wuhan, China, (currently at 1.38%). This value is compared with the obtained cCFR, and the percentage of coverage (the proportion of cases that are, in fact, confirmed) in different countries can be estimated. This is done in [8] and, for instance, the projected coverage in Portugal and Spain is 19% and 4.7%, respectively. These values can in turn be used to correct the number of reported confirmed cases in each country, and estimate the likely true number of cases, thus probing the iceberg that lurks under water.",

We do not control the spread of the survey nor the adequate coverage of regions, age groups and other parameters. Somewhat surprisingly, even given these limitations, we can still obtain a rough estimate and see that it is not far from those obtained with other techniques. One reason for this may be that each participant is typically reporting on the health status of a large sample (hundreds), which increases significantly the coverage of the survey. Obvious advantages of this approach are that it is very simple to deploy and can give very timely results.",

The latter are removed because we aim at surveying the general population that is not in particular high contact with symptomatic cases.

The dashed line is obtained by multiplying the number of fatalities by 400, while the solid dots \u2022 indicate the more precise estimate from the corrected case fatality rates, and compensating for the estimated coverage of testing. Finally, the diamond represents our estimates from the two initial Twitter surveys, and the triangles the results from the subsequent two more complete open surveys.",
