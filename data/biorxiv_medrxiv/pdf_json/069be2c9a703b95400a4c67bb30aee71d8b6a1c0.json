As of April 21, 2020, the total number of confirmed cases of COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus, exceeded more than 2.3 million worldwide. Efforts to control the spread of SARS-CoV-2 focused on non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs). These represent public health-policy measures that were intended to diminish transmission rates and, to this end, aimed at reducing person-to-person contacts via so-called social distancing [7] .

The majority of findings are based on transmission models where epidemiological parameters are informed by previous studies or corroborated via simulation. One study analyzed the impact of NPIs using data from different countries and found that the NPIs considered were together effective in reducing transmission rates [20] , using the link between true unobserved infections and deaths. Here we focus on the relative impact of individual NPIs in reducing the number of documented cases. This is yet unknown, although documented COVID-19 cases are essential for decision-makers in health-policy when monitoring and evaluating the impact of NPIs (e.g., controlling the outbreak in a way that surge capacities are not exceeded).",

First, prior research on SARS-CoV-2 transmissions indicated an incubation period of around 5 days [3] . Second, as testing was often performed only in response to symptoms and positive results may have been reported with some delay, a further overall delay of about two days was thus not unlikely. Third, behavioral responses could have varied with people adjusting their behavior with a certain delay or even before the NPI was issued.

In our analysis, this NPI belonged to those with only a rather moderate effect estimate, amounting to a 10 % reduction. This finding is in line with prior literature in which the transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 among children is regarded as comparatively small [11, 23] . The preceding argument also provides a possible explanation for why our model attributed only a small reduction of cases to this NPI. Lockdowns also had only a very moderate and possibly negligible effect. As our effect estimates describe the additional impact of an NPI on top of the other NPIs, the moderate effect of lockdown may be explainable by event bans, venue closures and gathering bans catching already a substantial part of the impact of a lockdown. Summing up the effects of all four NPIs, we obtain in any case a substantial effect. Event bans were located between the groups of NPIs with 13 Preprint submitted to medRxiv .

This is reflected by large credible intervals and a negative association between effects (Appendix D.2), suggesting that the effect of one NPI may be attributed partially to another. However, with respect to the ranking of NPIs, we were able to demonstrate that we can be fairly confident that venue closures, gathering bans, border closures, and work bans are among the four most effective NPIs and school closures and lockdowns among the two least effective when applied as a combination of NPIs.",

Using the number of documented cases implies that documentation practices may have an influence on the results. In particular, definitions and documentation practices differed between countries and over time. However, since the rate of new cases was investigated, many deviations from an optimal documentation practice will affect both the number of new cases and the number of existing cases in a similar manner and may thus cancel out. Short-term fluctuations were considered by including day-of-the-week effects and allowing for overdispersion. Moreover, it was taken into account that countries had to develop their documentation practices by starting with at least 100 cases for each country. However, there may still remain an undue influence of country-specific changes in documentation practices over time.",

Thereby, venue closures, gathering bans, border closures, and work bans showed similar effect sizes with a magnitude of the relative reduction above 15 %. With respect to event bans, an effect close to 0 % was precluded but the range of credible effects included a moderate relative reduction by 10 % up to much larger reductions.The posterior distributions of school closures and lockdowns focused on small effects with a magnitude of 0 % to 10 %, but for school closures a 20 % reduction was still credible.",

Data on documented COVID-19 casesA cross-country analysis for n = 20 countries was performed. The sample comprises the United States, Canada, Australia, the EU-15 countries (Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, and the United Kingdom), Norway, and Switzerland. Our selection of countries defines a sample that followed a similar and comparable overall strategy in controlling the COVID-19 outbreak and shares a common cultural background. In particular, Asian countries were excluded despite the availability of excellent data, as these countries have often responded quite differently based on their experience with previous pandemics such as the 2013 SARS-CoV-1 outbreak. Nevertheless, the sample entailed considerable variation across countries, as some countries have been affected severely, while others responded early as part of their mitigation strategy. Overall, the sample covers a population of \u223c0.8 billion people. SARS-CoV-2 infection figures for each country were obtained from the Johns Hopkins Coronavirus Resource Center, which was developed for real-time tracking of reported cases of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and directly aggregates cases recorded by local authorities in order to overcome time delays from alternative reporting bodies",
