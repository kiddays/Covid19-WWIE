In the model, we analyze the spread of COVID-19 by considering a new parameter, the motorcycle as a means of public transport, which has not been considered in several other models for COVID-19. We use the mathematical model to predict the spread and deaths and we suggest strategies that can be put in place to prevent the spread caused by motorcycle as a means of public transport.",

            "text": "The outbreak of COVID-19 was detected in December 2019 in mainland China with the city of Wuhan as the recognized epicenter(see [1] - [29] and the references therein). COVID-19 has since then been exported to other countries all over the world [7] . To describe and determine the dynamics of COVID-19, several mathematical models have been constructed by several researchers [2] - [6] . We realize that the insights that can be drawn from these models are discussed, especially as inputs for designing strategies to control the epidemics. Proposed model-based strategies on how to prevent the spread of the disease in local setting, such as during large social gatherings, are also discussed in details [8] - [13] . One of the parameters considered in most of the models is the exposure time which is an instrumental factor in spreading the disease [14] . With a basic reproduction number equal to 2, and 14-day infectious period, an infected person staying more than 9 hours in the event could infect other people [15] . As at now, there is an urgent need to develop a mathematical model to estimate the transmissibility and dynamic of the transmission of the virus [16] - [19] . Several researches [17] , [18] , [21] , [22] , [22] and [25] have focused on calculating the basic reproduction number R 0 by using the serial intervals and intrinsic growth rate or using ordinary differential equations and Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods [23] and [24] . A lot of these researches have certain similar characteristics: They show that social distancing can significantly slow down the spread of the COVID-19; They stipulated that the effectiveness depends very much on the initial and boundary conditions of social distancing and the results strongly vary by orders of magnitude if the process is initiated a few days earlier or later or the effectiveness of the measure is only slightly higher or lower; The details of the studies are difficult to understand for many readers and therefore a widespread trust on the efficiency on the actual measures regarding the COVID-19 pandemic can not easily be derived from scientific literature. Results from [26] show that the effectiveness of social distancing is particularly great for pandemic with a basic reproductive number of R 0 = 1.5 -2.5. For the COVID-19 pandemic, a basic reproduction number R 0 = 2.6 is estimated, with an uncertainty range from 1.5 to 3.5 as seen in [27] . R 0 specifies how many new cases are caused by an existing case on average. With R 0 \u00bf 1, the virus spreads exponentially at times, but for R 0 \u00a11 the spread stops on its own [30] . A large number of studies have now calculated the number of basic reproductions, the incubation period and the duration of the infectiousness based on the number of cases from China [30] . However, the transmission through use of motorcycles as a means of public transport particularly in developing economies have not considered in the published models. The COVID-19 therefore is still a world pandemic and is currently a challenge for several countries all over the the world but worse for the developing countries. The goal of this paper is to present a mathematical model of trigonometric form for the spread of the COVID-19, where we concentrate on a new parameter called the use of motorcycles as a means of public transport to predict spread and number of deaths due to the COVID-19.",

The epidemic curve from a sample of 30 days is presented. Simulation methods and statistical analysis was done using MATLAB version 9.7. The fourth-order RungeKutta method, with tolerance set at 0.001, was used to perform curve fitting. Selected preliminary models of COVID-19, published in official webpages of academic/research institutions, as preprints, or as journal articles since the outbreak are reviewed. Important insights from the results of these models are discussed. Moreover, a model using a Susceptible-Exposed-Infected (SEI) framework is has been carefully reviewed to propose measures to prevent epidemics during large events, e.g., during parties or concerts with huge crowds. The parameter values used in this model are based on the known information about COVID-19. The model is represented by a system of instantaneous and noninstantaneous differential equations, and simulated using MATLAB version 9.7. The Differential equations are then reduced into a trigonometric form and later analysed. Motorcycles are used in most developing countries for public transport. In Kenya, they are called \"Boda Boda\", while in Nigeria they are commonly known as \"Okada.\" Most people in the cities, towns and even in rural areas prefer motorcycle because they are faster, relatively cheap and can be used to avoid traffic jam in roads. Despite their usefulness, motorcycles contributes immensely to the spread of COVID-19 because the operators do not follow the traffic rules. For instance, they don't put masks and helmets, they carry excess passengers, they don't wash their hands as required. Hence, social distancing is not taken care of. Due to these factors, we study the transmissibility of COVID-19 as a result of the risk factors from the motorcycle operators.",
