The main conclusion of our work is that efficient and timely detection and isolation of these asymptomatic individuals can have dramatic effects on the effective reproduction number and healthcare burden parameters. This intervention can provide a valuable tool complementary to other non-pharmaceutical interventions to contain the epidemic.",

Unfortunately, new facts come with a lag compared to the virus spread and governments are forced to make prompt decisions based on limited evidence which changes at a staggering pace. The fight against a practically unknown enemy has been and still is the major obstacle. Aside from studying the virus's biology, infecting mechanisms, probable treatments and of course vaccine development, epidemic mathematical modelling has stepped forward.",

Most evidently, the Case fatality Rate (CFR) varies largely between countries (i.e. Italy 12%, Argentina 3%, Iceland 0.3%). Varying CFRs cannot be explained only by the different population age structure or available critical care beds. Most importantly, uneven and time-varying testing criteria in different countries make the CFR an inadequate severity parameter. South Korea and especially and more recently, Iceland's approach to testing massively for COVID-19 has brought us closer to the real Infection Fatality Rate (IFR) which describes more precisely the magnitude of the threat [2] . Better estimates of the IFR have given insights on two aspects. Firstly, the asymptomatic or very mildly symptomatic group of individuals is more significant than previously thought [3] [4] [5] since they represent the vast majority of the infected individuals. Secondly, these individuals, in most cases, are not detected nor isolated, and therefore appear to be the leading cause of the epidemic's spread.",

Argentina, as a developing country, was not going to be able to bear this pandemic without a health care collapse. Based on the epidemic behaviour in Europe, the government determined a complete lock-down as the primary measure of control for the country as from March 20th, when Argentina's confirmed positive cases were only 128, mainly located in the capital city Buenos Aires and mostly imported. Many regions from inside Argentina had zero confirmed cases, including the authors' hometown, Mendoza province. Prompt lock-down measures significantly flattened the curve at an early stage. Arguably this was an anticipated measure, and it gave time to prepare (at least to some extent) for what was/is coming.",

We set our model to run in 4 zones of the Mendoza province considering their respective population, daily mobilization of people between the regions, and health care facilities for each area ( Figure 3) . As an example of the application of this tool, we simulated an outbreak in the North zone, starting with one infected person and monitored its arrival to the West area. We contemplated two different reproduction numbers; 0 = 4 (no mitigation nor suppression actions installed) or 0 = 2 (moderate containment measures governing the whole province). Around 10400 people travel every day between these districts. Without interfering in the communication routes between zones, it took 29 days (R0=4) and 88 days ( 0 = 2) for the virus to spread to the West zone. When travelling between the communities was reduced to a tenth, the outbreak reached the West with a 17-day lag (day 46) in the 0 = 4 scenario and a 42-day delay (day 130) for the 0 = 2 scenario (Figure 4) . As expected, this shows that blocking communication routes between districts is an excellent strategy to delay the entrance of the epidemic. Anyhow, this action has more power when combined with other containment measures as shown here by comparing a 0 = 4 versus an 0 = 2 situation. Furthermore, in this restricted communication situation, the exponential curves eventually catch up if no other interventions are instated (data not shown in graph). The communication restriction between North and West practically does not modify the North's dynamic, so in Figure  4 , we only show the basal state of the Northern District.

Elaborating on this result, we can add that fast and efficient detection plus the isolation of asymptomatic individuals can indeed control the epidemic. The effective reproduction number of the model shown in Figure 1 is significantly altered by fast and efficient detection plus the isolation of asymptomatic individuals, as shown in Figure 5 . If the efficiency of detection is 50% within three days of becoming infectious, the effective reproduction number can be reduced by a half. If this policy is accompanied by other non-pharmaceutical interventions that lower the basic reproduction number such as mitigation and suppression measures then the effective reproduction number can be brought to values lower than one, effectively controlling the epidemic. On the opposite extreme, the effective reproduction number is larger than the 0 parameter when asymptomatics are not isolated and therefore remain infectious until recovery.

In a basic reproduction number scenario of 2, isolating half of the asymptomatic individuals within four days of becoming infectious can effectively double the time it takes for clinical cases to duplicate in the exponential growth phase. This effect is smaller for more significant reproduction numbers reinforcing the statement that other interventions must accompany this policy in order to control the epidemic. The consequence on the effective reproduction number of the removal of asymptomatic individuals from the infectious pool affects both epidemic dynamics and equilibrium values.

This evidence supports once more what we said in the previous scheme; life cannot return to normal when suppression measures are relaxed. (Figure. 7 ). Considering that once the epidemic has struck, social standards are entirely changed, we simulated an alternation of 0 and between 2 and 1, meaning this that once strict measures are relaxed, there are still essential actions being taken (i.e. social distancing, University and colleges remain closed, etc.). In Figure 8 we show that the Northern area can stand this situation without a sanitary collapse, needing two quarantines to surpass the epidemic. The other, more rural areas still have an overwhelmed health care system and need much more time in maximum isolation.",
