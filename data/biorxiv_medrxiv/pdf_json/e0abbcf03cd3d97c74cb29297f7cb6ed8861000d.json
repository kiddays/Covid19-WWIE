Further, we evaluated synergy between pyronaridine and artesunate (Pyramax\u00ae), which are used in combination to treat malaria. Artesunate was not found to have lysosomotropic activity in vitro and the combination effect on EBOV inhibition was shown to be additive.

The most recent outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, has killed more than 2200 people (4) . Even with approval of a vaccine for prevention of EVD (5) there is still an urgent need to advance development of filovirus-specific antiviral therapeutics. A clinical trial (NCT03719586) investigated ZMapp (a monoclonal antibody cocktail) (6) ), remdesivir (a small molecule), MAb114 (a monoclonal combination) (7)) and REGN-EB3 (monoclonal antibody combination) (8). These results showed that the antibodies REGN-EB3 and mAb114 had overall statistically similar survival rates of 71% and 66%, respectively. Unfortunately, ZMapp and remdesivir were less effective with a 51% and 47% survival rates, respectively (9) . With remdesivir showing no statistically significant clinical efficacy the search for antiviral small molecules continues.",

Previously we evaluated pyronaridine, tilorone and quinacrine in vitro for its anti-EBOV activity (Zaire strain) in the type I IFN-deficient Vero 76 cell line (19, 20) and no antiviral activity was observed at any concentration below the 50% cytotoxicity concentration. In HeLa cells all three drugs demonstrated selectivity (12, 14) . These observations support the hypothesis that their antiviral activity could be partially acting through or on the type I IFN-related innate immunity pathway (15). We also tested a combination of pyronaridine with tilorone in HeLa cells and evaluated the data with the BRAID model which suggested they are likely synergistic (21). Based on published data for tilorone and quinacrine, which are well known to be lysosomotropic agents, it was suspected that this may also be important. In addition, pyronaridine is used as an antimalarial in combination with artesunate (Pyramax\u00ae). We had previously determined that artesunate also has micromolar in vitro inhibitory activity against EBOV (22). We now assess whether pyronaridine accumulates in lysosomes and if there is any effect with artesunate or its active metabolite dihydroartemisinin against EBOV when combined with pyronaridine in vitro.",

More recently, combinations of approved drugs found in these and other studies have suggested synergistic combinations (44) (45) (46) (47) . To date, none of these many efforts for EBOV have resulted in a clinical antiviral candidate. Several small molecule antivirals were felled at the hurdle of animal models, specifically the transition from mouse to the guinea pig model.

We have also previously used these ML models to predict in vitro efficacy for drugs that were then tested against EBOV (12, 22) . The mechanism for these three compounds against EBOV is unknown. Others have demonstrated that compounds with physicochemical properties such as a basic pKa (> 6.5) and cLogP of > 2 tend to be lysosomotropic (38) and they accumulate in the lysosomes. We have now taken an ML approach to predict potential for a lysosomotropic mechanism using published in vitro data (38, 39) along with ECFP6 molecular fingerprints and a Bayesian algorithm. We have now performed several in vitro studies to validate the predictive ability of this model as well as infer the potential mechanism of one of these EBOV drugs. Pyronaridine clearly is a potent lysosomotropic agent, more so than all the other molecules tested. There is a strong correlation between published anti-EBOV activity and the lysosomotropic property (Table S2 ) for a large number of drugs. All of the compounds that were considered actives in our model were researched to identify whether they had been previously tested against EBOV and or MARV either with a psuedovirus/VLP and or a competent virus inhibition assay. 21 of 23 of these compounds had been tested previously and all inhibited these viruses, with AC 50 s almost all in the nM to low \u00b5M range.

Artesunate which is also similarly active against EBOV was found not to share this physiological characteristic. The initial combination of these two drugs to form Pyramax\u00ae was to avoid drug resistance of Plasmodium parasites, the causative agents of Malaria and has been extensively reviewed (52) . The combinations of these two molecules are additive in inhibiting EBOV replication in vitro but with a reduced cytotoxicity as compared to the individual treatments (Figure 2 and 3). Previous work has suggested that it is possible to identify pairs of drugs that block EBOV infection in vitro via the same methodology as used here (47) This current study has implications outside of EBOV, with the increased interest in antivirals for testing against SARS-CoV-2, and in particular the heavy focus on chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, which have shown low micromolar activity in vitro against this virus (54) (55) (56) (57) . Pyronaridine has recently also been shown to have some limited activity against SAR-CoV-2 in Vero cells (54) , but Vero cells may not be as appropriate as human cells to test compounds such as pyronaridine (low in vitro selectivity index, but high in vivo antiviral activity). Based on our previous findings, this leaves the distinct possibility that there has been an underestimate of pyronaridine's .

Physicochemical properties and Assay Central lysosomotropic machine learning predictions for compounds tested in vitro. An applicability score of 1 indicates that all the fragments are in the model and may indicate the molecule is in the training set (chloroquine is in the training set). (Calculated with ACD/Labs PhysChem Batch program $ , (59)) Predicted pka's (negative log of the acid dissociation constant) were obtained from drugbank, which were initially calculated using Chemaxon. AlogP (predicted log octanol-water partition coefficient was calculated via Discovery Studio). plots of the smoothed raw data, predicted additive inhibition and predicted inhibition using the 7-parameter BRAID analysis. It is noted that inhibition data under toxic concentrations (>50% cell death) were removed from the analysis. The \"Additive\" or \"BRAID\" error represents the corresponding accuracy of fit with the \"Observed Effect\". \u03ba represents the combinatory effect where \"strong synergy\" corresponds to \u03ba = 2.5, \"mild synergy\" corresponds to \u03ba = 1, \"mild antagonism\" corresponds to \u03ba = \u22120.66, and \"strong antagonism\" corresponds to \u03ba = \u22121.
