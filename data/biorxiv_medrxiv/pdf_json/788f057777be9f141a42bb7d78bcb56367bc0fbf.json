The model divides the total population into several possible states or compartment : susceptible (S), exposed (E) infected and being under an incubation period, infected (I) being infectious, simple or mild removed R M , severe removed (including hospitalized) R S and death cases (D). The adding of the two new compartment R M and R S are driven by data which together replace the original R compartment in the classical SEIR model. We first fit the constant transmission rate parameter to the epidemic data in Mayotte during an early exponential growth phase using an algorithm with a package of the software R and based on a Maximum Likewood estimator. This allows us to predict the epidemic without any control in order to understand how the control measure and public policies designed are having the desired impact of controlling the epidemic. To do this, we introduce a temporally varying decreasing transmission rate parameter with a control or quarantine parameter q. Then we pointed out some values of q to maintain control which is critical in Mayotte given the fragility of its health infrastructure and the significant fraction of the population without access to water.",

The epidemic began slightly later in France, from February. To prevent further spread of COVID-19, all travel into Mayotte for tourism and family visits was prohibited from Friday, March 20. Only essential travel for selected individuals, such as residents returning home, professionals from essential services, and patients with health conditions was allowed to entry. Local authorities have advised all travelers arriving from the mainland France or areas affected by COVID-19 to self-isolate at home for 14 days and avoid contact with others. In addition, the government has urged the public to observe good personal hygiene, such as regular hand washing. Individuals who develop respiratory symptoms, such as cough, fever, and difficulty breathing, within 14 days of arrival into Mayotte are advised not to visit the doctor or emergency room directly, but to contact the SAMU (French Emergency Medical Services) immediately by dialing 15. Further international infected travellers of the virus was expected until March 29 ; but from March 30 the government has decided to cancel all flights both departure and arrival in Mayotte.",

Mathematical models can be defined as a method of emulating real life situations with mathematical equations to expect their future behavior. In epidemiology, mathematical models are relevant tools in analyzing the spread and control of infectious diseases. Based on the development and epidemiological characteristics of COVID-19 infection, a modified SEIR model is appropriate to study the dynamic of this disease. The population is partitioned into susceptible (S), exposed (E) infected and being under an incubation period, infected (I) being infectious, simple or mild removed R M , severe removed (including hospitalized) R S and death cases (D). It is well known that one of the most useful parameters concerning infectious diseases is called basic reproduction number. It can be specific to each strain of an epidemic model. Estimating the basic reproduction numbers for COVID-19 presents challenges due to the high proportion of infectious not detected by health systems and regular changes in testing policies, resulting in different proportions of infections being detected over time and between countries. Most countries so far only have the capacity to test a small proportion of suspected cases and tests are reserved for severely ill patients or for high-risk groups (e.g. contacts of cases appeared in Mulhouse,France). Looking at case data, therefore, gives a systematically biased view of trends. However, in France and other contries in Europe the basic reproduction numbers for COVID-19 is betwen 2 and 3 at the begining of the epidemic with an average around 2.5.",

Our model can thus be used to project the time-line of the model forward in time. We propose various scenarios on this control to show how the impact of strict respect of the government measure can lead to have a control on the capacity of the main hospital in Mayotte to manage severe cases according to the maximal number of staff and places available.",

Mayottes Regional Health Agency and local authorities confirms the first case of new coronavirus infection on march 14 but reported on march 13, an imported case. He was an individual who traveled from the metropolitan France and back to Mayotte three days ago. Subsequently, two others imported case was reported few days later but arrived at the same moment like the first one. According to this information we choose the initial number of infected people I(0) = 3. But 5 others imported case was confirmed on march 20. After that 8 others imported on March 26. Again three others imported cases were confirmed from march 27. Thus a total of 17 imported cases were confirmed two week days later. One can thus think that almost 1 imported case is introduced per day after march 13 until march 28. But since March 29, the authorities of Mayotte department and France have decided to close and cancel all flights to and from Mayotte, which therefore limits the introduction of new imported cases but cannot prevent the spread of the virus. In this case and according to Remark ??, we can assume that among susceptibles individuals a negligible fraction of international infectious individuals subsequently travel and are detected in their destination to Mayotte. Thus, according to the model (??) one may take y(t) = t as a variable number y(t) of infectious international travellers to Mayotte at time t.

Suppose that thenumbers of potentially infectious contacts between an infectious individual and another individual in successive time intervals [t, t+T ),[t+T, t+2T ), ..., [t+(n1)T, t+nT ) are independent identically distributed random variables and that n is very large.
