Coronaviruses are positive-sense, single stranded RNA viruses that cause disease pathology ranging from the common cold to pneumonia. 2, 3 Despite being listed on the WHO blueprint priority list, there are currently no licensed vaccines for SARS or MERS. 4 However, previous studies have elucidated the need to stabilize coronavirus spike proteins in their pre-fusion conformation in order to serve as a vaccine immunogen. 5 Self-amplifying RNA (saRNA) encapsulated in lipid nanoparticles (LNP) is a highly relevant platform for producing vaccines in the context of a global pandemic as it's possible to encode any antigen of interest 6, 7 and requires a minimal dose compared to messenger RNA (mRNA). 8 The first RNA therapeutic, which is formulated in LNP, was approved in 2018 and has set the precedent for clinical safety of LNP-formulated RNA. 9 Here, we compare the immunogenicity of saRNA encoding a pre-fusion stabilized SARS-CoV-2 spike protein encapsulated in LNP in a preclinical murine model to the immune response generated by a natural infection in recovered COVID-19 patients. We characterize both the humoral and cellular response as well as the neutralization capacity of a pseudotyped SARS-CoV-2 virus.",
