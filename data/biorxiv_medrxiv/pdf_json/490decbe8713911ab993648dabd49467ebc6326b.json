Coronavirus can be transmitted by people who are infected by this pandemic. The chance of getting infected for an infectious individual is very higher. which means that the factor \u03b2 satisfies 0 \u2264 \u03b2 \u2264 1.",

Since, the parameter is defined by the product of the probability of successfully getting infected when coming into contact with an infected individual and the per-capita contact rate, for that, it is necessary to decrease these two parameters which depend both on \"the contact\".
