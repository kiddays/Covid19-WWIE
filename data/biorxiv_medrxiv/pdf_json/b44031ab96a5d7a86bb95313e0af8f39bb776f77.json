At the same time, it was advised that small business and private meetings be cancelled voluntarily, meaning that the measure was not enforced by law. Therefore, people were not arrested even if they did not comply with this government requirement [2] . Nevertheless, the effort depends on voluntary compliance of the people. Moreover, this was the first time to require voluntary event cancellation. Those reasons complicate the ex ante prediction of the proportion of events which were cancelled and the extent to which contacts were reduced. Moreover, since March 3, almost all schools were closed from the middle of March to spring vacation as a measure to control the spread of COVID-19. Even though they can be infected and can transmit the virus to adults, school closure effects were questionable ex ante because schoolchildren are not the most susceptible age class for All rights reserved.

We particularly examine how policies affect the effective reproduction number. Therefore, we ignore prediction of the entire course of the outbreak and its outcomes such as the number of deaths. Nevertheless, outcomes are expected to be a primary concern for modelling. Moreover, collapse of medical services can be expected to lead to worse outcomes even if the reproduction number remains unchanged. Prediction of the effects of severe policies including lockdowns is expected as a future challenge for our research.",

After VECSC, the reproduction number escalated again beyond that before VECSC. Similar phenomena might occur after a lockdown.
