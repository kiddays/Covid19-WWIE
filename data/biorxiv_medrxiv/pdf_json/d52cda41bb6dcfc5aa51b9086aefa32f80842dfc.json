If we are willing to assume that a single member of a household with n members will infect the remaining members with probability 1, then the number of deaths in a household follows a binomial distribution with parameters (n\u22121, p) where p is the CFR. Although the method may be affected by classification errors, its simplicity will allow to reduce the error of the estimates by increasing the sample size, since it requires minimal laboratory testing capabilities. We illustrate our methodology with data from Mexico and estimate the CFR in 0.34 %, that is, we estimate that the total number of infections is about 300 times larger than the number of deaths. We specify some dataset limitations. In comparison, using the number of deaths to date and a recently published results from random tests in Iceland, we calculated the ratio estimated infections/deaths in about 200 for that country.",

These estimates are particularly important to estimate the total number of infections by expanding the fraction of observed in some category, for the instance the number of hospitalized persons or the number of deaths. 10 Let p = [p 1 , p 2 , . . . , p s ] be the probabilities that an individual will develop reaction i from a possible set reactions, for instance: S = {None, Mild, Severe, Death} or any other categorization that can be associated to an individual without error and where the categories are mutually exclusive.

The simplest explanation is the following: we know that in an infected 110 household with n j members, there are n j \u2212 1 individuals that have been subject to a contact. If one of the members of the household has a contact with an individual outside its household, its response still counts regardless of where the infection was acquired. Recall that we are estimating the probability of having a specific reaction to infection, not the probability of infection. This is 115 the rationale we use to select a member at random from the duplicates in the list of deaths. It is not relevant who is the infected zero, we only need to ensure there was enough pressure of infection to guarantee a contact.",

This is due to the fact that state, county, city and street are known, but in most cases there is no street number, so, in this approximation 125 we considered two cases in the same street as belonging to the same household, which underestimates the number of households. Observe that the denominator in (1) can be written as m(\u00b5 \u2212 1), where \u00b5 is the average household size, thus this approach tends to overestimatep in (1).",

Special care must be taken since both, the number of observed deaths in Iceland and the study in Mexico are small. The method presented here is simple enough to be applied in countries with 165 relatively few tracking capabilities. All it is needed is a list of households (a sample may suffice) with the total number of members in the household and the number of deaths for COVID-19 in each household. The precision of estimate (1) depends on the sample size m, and the precision of estimate (2) depends in addition on how good is our estimate of the actual number of deaths from 170 COVID-19 to date. Overall, the precision will depend on our ability to diagnose COVID-19 related deaths. Assumption (i) is central for this proposal, but there is a way to avoid it although clearly at a larger economic cost: this consists in testing all the members of the household of a confirmed case. The estimate (1) can still be 175 applied using only data of confirmed cases, but now x is the number of deaths among all confirmed cases in all households (excluding the infected zero) and n the total number of confirmed cases in all households (including the infected zero).",
