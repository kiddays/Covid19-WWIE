Also, the analysis of SMD showed that patients with severe COVID-19 have a significantly higher serum levels of CRP (SMD = 3.363, P value <.001), D-Dimer (SMD = 1.073, P value <.001), and LDH (SMD = 3.345, P value <.001) .

The disease kept spreading dramatically to reach other provinces in China and other countries around the world, forcing the WHO to declare it as a global pandemic on the 11 th of March 2020 [3] . Despite the efforts done to contain the disease, it has spread to over 200 countries around the world, causing a significant burden at the level of health facilities, as well as economic burdens on international systems [4] .",

However, there is a wide gap between the total population and the number of intensive care beds available [9] . Further adding to the burden, ICU services cost the hospitals around 39% of the total drug costs, 25% of the equipment, and 13% of the lab investigations [10] . Researchers are still working to find a definitive treatment of COVID-19 and there are ongoing trials on some antiviral, anti-inflammatories, and anti-malarial drugs such as hydroxyl-chloroquine sulfate and chloroquine phosphate products to be used for certain hospitalized patients with COVD-19 [5, 11] .",

Other investigations have been used to evaluate the patient's condition and to predict severe outcomes of the disease such as complete blood count, D-Dimer, Procalcitonin, Creactive protein (CRP), and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) [4] [5] . Two recent meta-analyses showed that increased Procalcitonin values and thrombocytopenia are associated with a higher risk of severe COVID-19 [12] [13] . Other studies suggested that lymphocytes count, D-Dimer, CRP, and LDH have a role in the prognosis of COVID-19. However, and to the best of our knowledge, there is no meta-analysis on these biomarkers. Therefore, the objective of this review is to assess the association between severe COVID-19 and these laboratory markers. Taking into consideration the disease burden and the limited resources and capacities of health facilities, it is very crucial to find parameters that support the clinical condition's risk assessment to aid the anticipation of severe complications.",

Based on several studies, it has been suggested that the immune system is impaired during the disease and COVID-19 might damage T lymphocytes [6, 8, 28] . These studies showed a particular decrease in the CD4+ subset of lymphocytes and higher naive CD4+ cells than memory cells in severe cases [6, 8, 28] . The higher naive : memory cells ratio indicates that the immune system was impaired more severely [6, 8] . The resulted cytokine .
