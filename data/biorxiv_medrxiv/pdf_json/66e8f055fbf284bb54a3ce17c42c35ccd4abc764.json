Disease mitigation strategies require informed decision-making to ensure a balance between the protection of the vulnerable from disease and the maintenance of global economies. We show that temporally restricted containment efforts, 15 that have the potential to flatten epidemic curves, can result in wider disease spread and larger epidemic sizes in metapopulations. Longer-term rewiring of metapopulation networks or the enforcement of feasible long-term measures that decrease disease transmissions appear to be more efficient than temporarily restricted intensive mitigation strategies (e.g. short-term mass quarantine).

In fact, it is well known that contact network structure and patterns of connectivity among local populations are main drivers of contagion processes from local to regional scale, with contact frequencies among populations largely determining whether local epidemics are coupled or not (8) . However, the extent to which temporarily restricted intensive mitigation strategies (e.g. short-term total containment) in response to the COVID-19 epidemic can successfully lower overall epidemic size, and protect those most vulnerable, has yet to be quantified. and compared across different scenarios of landscape-level connectivity (i.e. metapopulation structure). 65 Theory predicts that metapopulation extinction-colonization dynamics can maintain disease persistence even with frequent local fade-out and extirpation (9) . If local epidemics in different populations are weakly coupled, synchronous but short-term mitigation strategies may fail their target to contain disease spread during epidemic peaks (10). Further, local containment of 70 outbreaks with delayed local extirpation may facilitate disease spread at the metapopulation level. Metapopulation source-sink dynamics, the effect of metapopulation structure, and the role of depleted pools of susceptible individuals (i.e. herd immunity), have been studied in the context of disease spread for decades (11) . Nevertheless, there is a lack of understanding of whether and how temporally restricted intensive mitigation strategies, could result in long-term 75 reduction of overall infection rates on spatially structured metapopulations. Understanding the usefulness of short-term intensive containment strategies constitutes a pressing challenge in times of the ongoing COVID-19 crisis. More generally, this understanding will contribute to the unresolved debate on whether it is possible to establish alternatives to socioeconomically detrimental mass quarantines (6, 12) . 80 All rights reserved.

This result, however is in line with general expectations of how 160 metapopulations dynamics explain disease persistence alongside local suppression and spatial dissemination among connected populations(9, 14,15). If short-term intensive containment efforts designed to flatten the epidemic curves of COVID-19 result in more prolonged ('flattened') local epidemics (4), disease spread among different populations can be particularly facilitated in highly connected populations and unfold its adverse effects at larger scale. This 165 effect helps to explain the surprisingly low benefit of temporary mitigation strategies, including whole population isolation measures over several weeks or months.Crucially, we do want to emphasize that containment efforts are absolutely vital for protecting people from infection by newly emerging disease such as COVI-19 until global vaccinations campaigns are in place to contain any further spread. We contend that constantly lowering 170 transmission rates and carefully circumventing those links in metapopulation networks most supportive for disease spread, can ultimately reduce epidemic size at metapopulation scale.",
