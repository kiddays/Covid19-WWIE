In the case of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), droplet spread can occur from symptomatic as well as presymptomatic and asymptomatic persons. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has therefore recently recommended home-made cloth face coverings for use by the general public in areas of significant community-based transmission. Because medical masks and N95 respirators are in short supply, these are to be reserved for healthcare workers. There is, however, little information on the effectiveness of home-made face coverings in reducing droplet dissemination. Here, we ascertained the performance of ten different fabrics, ranging from cotton to silk, in blocking high velocity droplets, using a 3-layered commercial medical mask as a benchmark material. We also assessed their breathability and ability to soak water. We reason that the materials should be as breathable as possible, without compromising blocking efficiency, to reduce air flow through the sides of the mask since such flow would defeat the purpose of the mask. We found that most home fabrics substantially block droplets, even as a single layer. With two layers, blocking performance can reach that of surgical mask without significantly compromising breathability. Furthermore, we observed that home fabrics are hydrophilic to varying degrees, and hence soak water. In contrast, medical masks are hydrophobic, and tend to repel water. Incoming droplets are thus soaked and \"held back\" by home fabrics, which might offer an as of yet untapped and understudied advantage of homemade cloth masks. Overall, our study suggests that most double-layered cloth face coverings may help reduce droplet transmission of respiratory infections.",

            "text": "At the crux of any pandemic is the transmission of a pathogenic agent, e.g. a novel virus, that spreads in populations on a global scale. Current knowledge from influenza, SARS-1, and MERS indicates three major routes of transmission: droplets, aerosols, and contact [1, 2] . Although the mechanism of spread of the current novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) is not clearly understood, it is thought that spread can occur through droplets containing virus particles when infected persons sneeze, cough, or speak [2] [3] [4] . Larger droplets tend to fall nearby by gravity, and the smaller ones can travel longer [1, 5, 6] . Droplets inhaled by a healthy individual allow the virus to enter the respiratory system and cause infection. The larger droplets can also give rise to short range direct transmission mediated through hand contacts [6, 7] . Face masks can offer a physical barrier against virus transmission. This is particularly true for SARS-CoV-2 virus that are shed by symptomatic, pre-symptomatic, and asymptomatic carriers [8] [9] [10] [11] . During the COVID-19 pandemic, the supply of commercially manufactured facemasks has not been able to meet the demand. This raises the question whether home-made face masks can be used by the general public to reduce transmission.",

            "text": "Recently, the U.S. CDC has provided new guidance for the public to use non-commercial alternative to facemasks such as cloth face coverings in order to slow the spread of COVID-19 [12] . However, it is not yet clear what kind of fabric would be the most efficient material or how many layers of cloth would protect against both spreading and contracting the virus. Existing literature on home-made masks have mostly focused on the filtration efficacy of the masks against aerosol or dry airborne particles less than 1\u00b5m in size under prescribed flows or pressure differentials [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] . These studies are relevant for situations where an individual is breathing in an atmosphere with pathogenic aerosol particles. In contrast, when a patient or an asymptomatic person coughs, sneezes, or talks into a mask, the droplets that hit the inside of the mask are relatively large, and they have high momentum [6] . Also, when healthcare providers provide care to patients, they can be on the receiving end of such droplets that may be loaded with pathogens. How home-made masks can be effective in these scenarios remains elusive. This has led to controversies on the use of home-made masks and their effectiveness. To address this issue in the current context of COVID-19, we evaluated medical masks along with ten regular household fabrics for their droplet blocking efficiency against high and low velocity droplets in a laboratory setting. We also assessed their breathability, i.e., the ease of breathing through these fabrics. We first define the scope of our study.",

For the former, the mask is most challenged when droplets land on the mask cloth with high momentum (high mass and velocity) [18, 19] . For the recipient, the droplet momentum is small or negligible. If a common mask is to be applicable to both, then the mask material (i) must be able to resist the high momentum droplets, and (ii) still be breathable enough so that air does not go through the sides of the mask. Large fraction of air flow through the sides defeats the purpose of the mask, as droplets can be carried with the side flow, and the mask provides a false sense of protection. Thus, the two critical parameters for any mask material are breathability, , and efficiency of blocking droplets, . High breathability may reduce blocking efficiency, and vice versa. The problem of finding an appropriate material for a home-made mask thus reduces to picking a fabric that maximizes both the parameters. We consider a set of ten common household fabrics. Their properties are compared with a medical mask fabric (Face Mask, FM-EL style) consisting of three layers (Fig. 1) . This medical mask serves as our benchmark.",

The weight (mass per unit area) of each fabric was measured using a high precision weighing scale. To assess the hydrophilicity and water soaking ability of fabrics, a 100\u00b5l droplet of water was dispensed onto the fabric and videos of the process of wetting and soaking were recorded. Supplementary Video 1 provides a qualitative comparison of the hydrophobic non-soaking medical mask, a slow-soaking fabric, and a highly hydrophilic fast-soaking fabric. Water soaking ability was quantified by processing the droplet soaking videos and calculating the rate of change of soaked fabric area (soaking speed in mm 2 /s in Table 1 ).

            "text": "A schematic illustration of our experimental method for measuring droplet blocking efficiency is shown in Fig. 2a . To generate droplets with high initial velocity, we used a metered-dose inhaler (Ventolin HFA) [23, 24] and loaded the nozzle of the inhaler with 10\u00b5l of a suspension of 100nmdiameter fluorescent beads (Invitrogen) in distilled water (3.6x10 10 beads/ml). The fluorescent beads serve two purposes: (1) mimic SARS-CoV-2 virus (70-100nm-diameter) in terms of size [25, 26] , and (2) allow to quantify the blocking efficiency of the fabric samples. When the inhaler is pressed, the internal pressure of the inhaler pushes the bead suspension out of the nozzle, creating high speed droplets moving along the direction of the inhaler tube. The droplets then hit the fabric sample that is placed in front of the inhaler (Fig. 2b) . We used a high-speed camera (Fastcam, Photron) to record the motion of the droplets with 10,000 frames per second (Supplementary Videos 2-5). Image analysis revealed that the velocity of the droplets is about 17m/s near the inhaler and decreases as they travel through air (Fig. 2c) . The velocity reduces to about 2.7m/s at 300mm (~12 inch) from the inhaler.",

To solve this problem, we first coated the bottom of the petri dish with 1ml of warm gelatin solution (5% wt/v in distilled water). Gelatin forms a hydrogel at and below room temperature and melts at higher temperatures [27] . We let the gelatin solution gel inside the petri dishes at 4\u00b0C, then shot droplets as before, with and without fabric samples (separate petri dish for each test). Now the droplets containing beads were collected on the gelatin layer. Next, we warmed the samples to 37\u00b0C in an incubator to liquify the gelatin layer and allow the beads to dissolve into the gelatin solution. This solution was transferred to a vial, vortexed for 20s, then sonicated for 30min to uniformly disperse the fluorescent beads in solution. 400\u00b5l of this homogenized bead-gelatin mixture was pipetted into the well of a glass-bottom petri dish, the well was covered with a glass coverslip, and the sample was returned to 4\u00b0C to allow the solution to gel. The beads were thus frozen in place in the hydrogel.",

In all cases, the fabrics were placed at a distance of 25mm (~1 inch) from the nozzle of the inhaler. These tests represent the case of mask users releasing droplets with high momentum on the mask by sneezing, coughing, and speaking. We find that most fabrics have reasonable efficiency in blocking high momentum droplets with a single layer. With two layers, their efficiency can reach that of the medical mask. It is thus expected that the efficiency will be even better for low momentum droplets, which is the case for users receiving droplets from a distance.",

Fig. 3a illustrates the concept of measuring . We used a plug flow tube [20, 21] for the measurements. Here, the sample fabric seals the opening of a plug flow tube. Pressurized air was pumped through the tube. Pressure outside the tube is atmospheric and the pressure inside the tube was measured with respect to the atmosphere. Thus, air was forced through the fabric by the gauge pressure, . Since the area of the fabric sample subjected to air flow is the same as the cross-sectional area of the plug flow tube, the change in flow rate through unit area of fabric, , is equivalent to the change in average flow velocity, inside the tube. Hence, breathability can be written as \u2044 . In a plug tube, flow velocity is approximately uniform across the tube cross section [21, 22] . We measured velocity, , at the center of the tube, while the gauge pressure, , was measured at around 1/3 radius from the center.

The single-layered T-shirt (Fabric 5) has high breathability (7.8mm/Pa\u2022s) and poor blocking efficiency (43.3%).

With a single layer of T-shirt fabric, a significant number of small droplets pass through, giving a blocking efficiency of , whereas the medical mask allows only a few small droplets to go through ( ). The average velocity of the small droplets leaving the single layer of Tshirt fabric is about 8.5m/s, significantly lower than their incident velocity of 17m/s. The kinetic energy of the incident droplets is spent in deforming the fabric (bending and stretching) and in splitting the droplets (Fig. 4a) . The exiting small droplets do not have much momentum left to impact the second layer, if present. Many of them might even be soaked by the second layer. Indeed, high speed imaging reveals very few droplets exiting the 2-layered T-shirt fabric sample (Fig. 4b) . This reduction of momentum and the ability to soak water may explain the high blocking efficiency of 2-layered T-shirt fabric sample ( ). Thus, energy dissipation and soaking appear to be the key mechanisms of droplet blocking efficiency of home fabrics. After completion of the impact and partial transmission, the T-shirt fabric soaks and retains the remaining drop volume, whereas hydrophobic medical mask does not soak any liquid. Large droplets may just roll down the medical mask by gravity.",

The sample fabric is then wetted with water, placed on the bottle mouth without wrinkles, and tied in place with rubber bands. Next, the bottle is flipped, and the time that it takes water to drain out, T drain , is recorded using the stopwatch. We stopped the time when water stops streaming and starts to drip. Typically, the higher the breathability, the lower is the time required for draining. Hence, inverse of the draining time (1/T drain ) gives a measure of breathability of the fabric sample.

We found that the max. soaking speed is correlated with breathability (Fig. 5d) and anti-correlated with droplet blocking efficiency (Fig.  5e) .

We studied ten different common fabrics, 100% cotton to 100% polyester and silk, from shirts, T-shirts, quilt cloths, dishcloth, and bed sheet. We characterized these fabrics quantitatively for their ability to block high impact droplets from dissemination that occurs during sneezing and coughing, as well as for their breathability, weight, and their ability to soak water. We found that all of these fabrics have considerable efficiency at blocking droplets, even when used as a single layer. For example, a 1-layer T-shirt fabric had the lowest droplet blocking efficiency (43.3%) among all the fabrics studied for high impact droplets. However, when used in two and three layers, the efficiency increases to 98.6% and 99.98%, respectively, compared to the 96.3% efficiency of the 3-layered medical mask. Yet, the 3-layered T-shirt still has comparable breathability to the medical mask. Breathability is a critical parameter for any mask design. A high efficiency mask material with low breathability will have air flow through the sides allowing droplets to enter or exit the respiratory system. Home-made face coverings from such fabrics will only give a false sense of protection.",
