The suddenness and global scope of this pandemic has raised urgent questions that require coordinated investigation in order to slow the disease's devastation. A critically important public health objective is to identify key modifiable environmental factors that may contribute to the severity of the health outcomes (e.g., ICU hospitalization and death) among individuals with COVID-19. Data from China and Italy show that a majority of COVID-19 deaths occurred in adults aged \u226560 years1 and in persons with serious underlying health conditions.2-4 Early age-stratified COVID-19 death rates in the United States, reported by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC),5 also suggest that persons aged \u226565 are at highest risk. Additional factors associated with severe disease include male sex and the presence of comorbidities including hypertension, obesity, diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular disease, and chronic lung disease.6 7 Severe COVID-19 infection is characterized by a high inflammatory burden, and it can cause viral pneumonia with additional extrapulmonary manifestations and complications including acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS),8-13 which has a mortality rate ranging from 27% to 45%.14 Studies have also documented high rates of heart damage,11 15 cardiac arrhythmias,12 and blood clots16 in COVID-19 patients. Patients with severe disease can suffer respiratory failure and failure of other vital systems, leading to death.",

The association between PM2.5 and health, including both infectious and chronic respiratory diseases, cardiovascular diseases, neurocognitive disease, and pregnancy outcomes in the United States and worldwide is well established.18-24 A recent study by our group also documented a statistically significant association between long-term exposures to PM2.5 and ozone and risk of ARDS among older adults in the United States.25 Numerous scientific studies reviewed by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA) have linked PM2.5 to a variety of health concerns including premature death in people with heart or lung disease, non-fatal heart attacks, irregular heartbeats, aggravated asthma, decreased lung function, and increased respiratory symptoms such as inflammation, airway irritations, coughing, or difficulty breathing. 26 We hypothesize that because long-term exposure to PM2.5 adversely affects the respiratory and cardiovascular systems and increases mortality risk,27-29 it also exacerbates the severity of COVID-19 infection symptoms and worsens the prognosis of COVID-19 patients. In this study, we quantified the impact of long-term PM2.5 exposure on COVID-19 mortality rates in United States counties. Our study includes 3,087 counties in the United States, covering 98% of the population.",

The results indicate that long-term exposure to air pollution increases vulnerability to the most severe COVID-19 outcomes. We found statistically significant evidence that an increase of 1 g/m3 in long-term PM2.5 exposure is associated with an 8% increase in the COVID-19 mortality rate. Our results were adjusted for a large set of socioeconomic, demographic, weather, behavioral, epidemic stage, social isolation measures, and healthcare-related confounders and demonstrated robustness across a wide range of sensitivity analyses.",

Also, unmeasured confounding bias is a threat to the validity of our conclusions. Unfortunately, in the midst of a pandemic it is not feasible to design a study and collect the data at the ideal level of spatial and temporal resolution to minimize all sources of bias. Yet, conditional on the data available, we have endeavored to adjust for confounding bias by all of the most important factors, including population density, time since the beginning of the outbreak, social isolation measures, behavior, weather, age structure, ethnicity, access to health care, and socio-economic factors. We also conducted 68 additional analyses to assess the robustness of the results to many modelling choices. Furthermore, we computed the E-value to demonstrate that the confounding effect of any unmeasured confounder would need to be much stronger than that of any of our observed confounders in order to explain away the relationship between PM2.5 exposure and COVID-19 mortality rate. The calculation of the E-value provided reassurance that the presence of a strong unmeasured confounder is unlikely; however, this possibility cannot be ruled out completely.",

We also note that the use of long-term county-level exposure data in our study likely led to some degree of exposure misclassification.

The results of these analyses were consistent with the main analysis. For the analysis of the PM2.5 categorized into quintiles, the MRR for the kth can be interpreted as the increase in COVID-19 mortality rate associated with a change from the first quintile to the kth quintile in long-term PM2.5 exposure.

Some studies57-59 have suggested that air pollution can also proliferate the transmission of infectious disease. If COVID-19 spread is indeed impacted by air pollution levels, which is not yet known, some of the effects detected in our study could be mediated by this factor as well.This analysis provides a timely characterization of the relationship between historical exposure to air pollution and COVID-19 deaths in the United States. Research on how modifiable factors may exacerbate COVID-19 symptoms and increase mortality risk is essential to guide policies and behaviors to minimize fatality related to the outbreak. Our analysis relies on up-to-date populationlevel COVID-19 data and well-validated air pollution exposure measures.Strengths of this analysis include adjusting for a wide range of potential confounders and a demonstrated robustness of results to different model choices. Moreover, the analyses rely exclusively on data and code that are publicly available. This provides a platform for the scientific community to continue updating and expanding these analyses as the pandemic evolves and data accumulate.",
