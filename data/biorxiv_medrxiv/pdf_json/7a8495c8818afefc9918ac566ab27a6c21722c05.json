Automated detection of lung infections from computed tomography (CT) images offers a great potential to augment the traditional healthcare strategy for tackling COVID-19. However, segmenting infected regions from CT scans faces several challenges, including high variation in infection characteristics, and low intensity contrast between infections and normal tissues. Further, collecting a large amount of data is impractical within a short time period, inhibiting the training of a deep model. To address these challenges, a novel COVID-19 Lung Infection Segmentation Deep Network (Inf-Net) is proposed to automatically identify infected regions from chest CT scans. In our Inf-Net, a parallel partial decoder is used to aggregate the high-level features and generate a global map. Then, the implicit reverse attention and explicit edge-attention are utilized to model the boundaries and enhance the representations. Moreover, to alleviate the shortage of labeled data, we present a semi-supervised segmentation framework based on a randomly selected propagation strategy, which only requires a few labeled images and leverages primarily unlabeled data. Our semi-supervised framework can improve the learning ability and achieve a higher performance. Extensive experiments on a COVID-19 infection dataset demonstrate that the proposed Inf-Net outperforms most cutting-edge segmentation models and advances the state-of-theart performance.",

            "text": "S INCE December 2019, the world has been facing a global health crisis: the pandemic of a novel Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) [1] , [2] . According to the global case count from the Center for Systems Science and Engineering (CSSE) at Johns Hopkins University (JHU) [3] (updated April 12th, 2020), 1,777,666 identified cases of COVID-19 have been reported so far, including 108,867 deaths and impacting more than 180 countries/regions. For COVID-19 screening, the reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) has been considered the gold standard. However, the shortage of equipment and strict requirements for testing environments limit the rapid and accurate screening of suspected subjects. Further, RT-PCR testing is also reported to suffer from high false negative rates [4] . As an important complement to ( RT-PCR tests, the radiological imaging techniques, e.g., Xrays and computed tomography (CT), have also demonstrated effectiveness in both current diagnosis, including follow-up assessment and evaluation of disease evolution [5] , [6] . Moreover, a clinical study with 1014 patients in Wuhan China, has shown that chest CT analysis can achieve 0.97 of sensitivity, 0.25 of specificity, and 0.68 of accuracy for the detection of COVID-19, with RT-PCR results for reference [4] . Similar observations were also reported in other studies [7] , [8] , suggesting that radiological imaging may be helpful in supporting early screening of COVID-19.",

[28] presented an automated lung segmentation system based on bidirectional chain code to improve the performance. However, the similar visual appearances of nodules and background makes it difficult for extracting the nodule regions. To overcome this issue, several deep learning algorithms have been proposed to learn a powerful visual representations [29] - [31] . For instance, Wang et al. [29] developed a central focused convolutional neural network to segment lung nodules from heterogeneous CT scans. Jin et al. [30] utilized GAN-synthesized data to improve the training of a discriminative model for pathological lung segmentation. Jiang et al. [31] designed two deep networks to segment lung tumors from CT scans by adding multiple residual streams of varying resolutions.",

Currently, there is increasing focus on training deep neural network using the SSL strategy [33] . These methods often optimize a supervised loss on labeled data along with an unsupervised loss imposed on either unlabeled data [34] or both the labeled and unlabeled data [35] , [36] . Lee et al. [34] provided to utilize a crossentropy loss by computing on the pseudo labels of unlabeled data, which is considered as an additional supervision loss. In summary, existing deep SSL algorithms regularize the network by enforcing smooth and consistent classification boundaries, which are robust to a random perturbation [36] , and other approaches enrich the supervision signals by exploring the knowledge learned, e.g., based on the temporally ensembled prediction [35] and pseudo label [34] .",

[15] categorized these applications into three scales, including patient scale (e.g., medical imaging for diagnosis [37] , [38] ), molecular scale (e.g., protein structure prediction [39] ), and societal scale (e.g., epidemiology [40] ). In this work, we focus on patient scale applications [18] , [22] , [37] , [38] , [41] - [44] , especially those based on CT scans. For instance, Wang et al. [37] proposed a modified inception neural network [45] for classifying COVID-19 patients and normal controls. Instead of directly training on complete CT images, they trained the network on the regions of interest, which are identified by two radiologists based on the features of pneumonia. Chen et al. [38] collected 46,096 CT image slices from COVID-19 patients and control patients of other disease. The CT images collected were utilized to train a U-Net++ [46] for identifying COVID-19 patients. Their experimental results suggest that the trained model performs comparably with expert radiologists in terms of COVID-19 diagnosis. In addition, other network architectures have also been considered in developing AI-assisted COVID-19 diagnosis systems. Typical examples include ResNet, used in [18] , [41] , and U-Net [47] , used in [42] . Finally, deep learning has been employed to segment the infection regions in lung CT scans so that the resulting quantitative features can be utilized for severity assessment [43] , large-scale screening [44] , and lung infection quantification [15] , [21] , [22] of COVID-19.",

As can be observed, CT images are first fed to two convolutional layers to extract high-resolution, semantically weak (i.e., low-level) features. Herein, we add an edge attention module to explicitly improve the representation of objective region boundaries. Then, the low-level features f 2 obtained are fed to three convolutional layers for extracting the high-level features, which are used for two purposes. First, we utilize a parallel partial decoder (PPD) to aggregate these features and generate a global map S g for the coarse localization of lung infections. Second, these features combined with f 2 are fed to multiple reverse attention (RA) modules under the guidance of the S g . It is worth noting that the RA modules are organized in a cascaded fashion. For instance, as shown in Fig. 2 , R 4 relies on the output of another RA R 5 . Finally, the output of the last RA, i.e., S 3 , is fed to a sigmoid activation function for the final prediction of lung infection regions.

However, Wu et al. [51] pointed out that, compared with high-level features, low-level features demand more computational resources due to larger spatial resolutions, but contribute less to the performance. Inspired by this observation, we propose to only aggregate high-level features with a parallel partial decoder component. Specifically, for an input CT image I, we first extract two sets of low-level features {f i , i = 1, 2} and three sets of highlevel features {f i , i = 3, 4, 5} using the first five convolutional blocks of Res2Net [52] . We then utilize the partial decoder p d (\u00b7) [51] , a novel decoder component, to aggregate the highlevel features with a paralleled connection. The partial decoder yields a coarse global map S g = p d (f 3 , f 4 , f 5 ), which then serves as global guidance in our RA modules.",

First, the PPD acts as the rough locator and yields a global map S g , which provides the rough location of lung infection regions, without structural details (see Fig. 2 ). Second, we propose a progressive framework, acting as the fine labeler, to mine discriminative infection regions in an erasing manner [53] , [54] . Specifically, instead of simply aggregating features from all levels [54] , we propose to adaptively learn the reverse attention in three parallel high-level features. Our architecture can sequentially exploit complementary regions and details by erasing the estimated infection regions from high-level side-output features, where the existing estimation is up-sampled from the deeper layer.",

However, we are aware that, in a clinical setting, in addition to the overall evaluation, clinicians might also be interested in the quantitative evaluation of different kinds of lung infections, e.g., GGO and consolidation. Therefore, we extend Semi-Inf-Net to a multi-class lung infection labeling framework so that it can provide richer information for the further diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19. The extension of Semi-Inf-Net is based on an infection region guided multi-class labeling framework, which is illustrated in Fig. 5 . Specifically, we utilize the infection segmentation results provided by Semi-Inf-Net to guide the multi-class labeling of different types of lung infections. For this purpose, we feed both the infection segmentation results and the corresponding CT images to a multi-class labeling network (FCN8s [58] in our case, which is popular in medical image segmentation tasks [59] , [60] ). This framework can take full advantage of the infection segmentation results provided by Semi-Inf-Net and effectively improve the performance of multi-class infection labeling.",

Inf-Net is owed to our coarse-to-fine segmentation strategy, where a parallel partial decoder first roughly locates lung infection regions and then multiple edge attention modules are employed for fine segmentation. This strategy mimics how real clinicians segment lung infection regions from CT scans, and therefore achieves promising performance. In addition, the advantage of our semi-supervised learning strategy is also confirmed by Fig. 6 . As can be observed, compared with Inf-Net, Semi-Inf-Net yields segmentation results with more accurate boundaries. In contrast, Inf-Net gives relatively fuzzy boundaries, especially in the subtle infection regions.",

Extensive experiments on our COVID-SemiSeg dataset have demonstrated that the proposed Inf-Net and Semi-Inf-Net outperform the cutting-edge segmentation models and advance the state-of-the-art performances. Our system has great potential to be applied in assessing the diagnosis of COVID-19, e.g., quantifying the infected regions, monitoring the longitudinal disease changes, and mass screening processing.",
