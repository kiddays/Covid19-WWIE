The model was fit using iterated particle filtering to case count and death count time series from 51 countries. We found evidence for a declining transmission rate in 42 of the 51 examined countries. Of those 42 countries 34 have significant evidence for subcritical transmission rates, although the decline in new cases are relatively slow compared to the initial growth rates. This suggests that global scale social distancing efforts to slow the spread of COVID-19 are effective although they need to be strengthened in many regions and maintained in others to avoid further resurgence of COVID-19. The slow decline also suggests alternative strategies to control the virus are needed before social distancing efforts are partially relaxed.",

The extremely rapid spread of COVID-19 in China (2) does not appear to be an anomaly: the disease has shown a short doubling time (2.4-3.6 days) outside of China as well (3) . As of April 17, 2020, the virus caused 2,181,508 reported infections, and 147,337 deaths globally (4) . In response, most affected countries/regions have implemented strong social distancing efforts, such as school closures, working-fromhome, shelter-in-place orders. As a result, the spread of COVID-19 slows down substantially in some countries (5) , and thus the epidemic curves are flattened. As social distancing induces high costs to both society and individuals, plans to relax social distancing are discussed. However, it is not clear if the transmission in these areas are subcritical and how long the transmission is reduced to a level that are manageable for health care systems.",

Following the approach suggested by King et al.(6) , we use a (partially) stochastic model and base our estimates on incidence rather than cumulative incidence data . Using both case count and death count of data allowed us to disentangle changes in surveillance intensity from changes in transmission (3) . We found evidence for large decreases in the country-level transmission rates, in several of the worst-affected countries. Importantly, using data up to April 16, 2020, we specifically tested whether the transmission is subcritical (i.e. the reproductive number R is below 1). Most countries showed large decreases in transmission rates over time, and some have transmission rates below the epidemic threshold, i.e. R = 1. On the other hand, many countries still appear to be showing rapid exponential growth. Given its highly contagious nature, COVID-19 can spread rapidly when strong social distancing measures are lifted, even partially (3) . Alternative strategies that can effective control the virus are needed when social distancing measures are relaxed.",

Any country in the data that had more than 2000 cumulative cases by April 16 was included in the modeled data. China and South Korea were excluded from the final analysis because the model was not capable of capturing the complex dynamics in those countries. To minimize the effect of repatriated cases we started each time series on the first day when the cumulative number of cases was greater than or equal to 100. All data processing and model fitting were otherwise done on the incidence scale. To address obvious bulk-reporting issues in the data (e.g. sudden zeros in the data followed by very large numbers), we smoothed the data using Tukey's 3-median method. Because several countries had days with a single death surrounded by days with no deaths, which the smoothing method would set to zero, days with a single death were not replaced with smoothed values. The original data and the smoothed data used for estimation are shown in Supplemental figure S1.",

To optimize the likelihood of the data, we used 2000 particles in 100 iterations for each country. The reported likelihoods were measured using 6000 particles at the optimized Maximum Likelihood Estimates (MLEs). The Monte Carlo error in the likelihood measurement was less than 0.1 log units. Because we are using an optimization rather than sampling method we fit a sequence of models to test if the data support time-variable detection and/or transmission rates. The first model assumes both the transmission rate and detection probability are constant (i.e. \u03c7 0 = \u03c7 f and \u03c1 0 = \u03c1 f ); the second model allows for time variable detection probability (i.e. \u03c7 0 = \u03c7 f ); the third model allows for time variable transmission rates \u03c1 0 = \u03c1 f ; and the fourth model estimates all the free parameters. We determine the best model by a sequence of likelihood ratio tests. If model 2 and/or model 3 are supported at \u03b1 = 0.05, then the model with the higher likelihood is preferred. If there is support for model 4 over the preferred model, then model 4 is considered best. This testing cascade avoids overfitting by considering both possible explanations in isolation and only including both if the data support it. Finally, for data sets that support a declining transmission rate, we run an additional model where the final transmission rate is set such that the reproduction number is 1. Note that the model structure assumes the final transmission rate is constant over the last 10 days of the data. We use the likelihood from that model conduct a likelihood ratio test to distinguish between countries that have nearly subcritical transmission rates to ones that have clear evidence of a shrinking epidemic.",

This may due to the assumption in the model that the delay in case detection from infection is constant over time, and the inability of the model to find a single time delay in case detection that fits both the case and death time series in Italy, Spain, and Iran both at the beginning and end of the data suggests heterogeneity in the detection rate over time of either cases or deaths in these countries.

Note that the starting exponential growth rate is the growth rate estimated from the initial data points we collected in each country, and it is not necessarily the rate of outbreak growth at the beginning of the outbreak. In countries with a decline, the average reduction in the transmission rate was 84% from the starting value. Of the included countries, 32 had shrinking epidemics (i.e. infected persons are generating less than 1 new infection on average). To further test whether there exists significant evidence that the transmission is sub-critical, we modified our model to force the final transmission to be at the threshold, i.e. the growth rate is 0, during the last 10 days of simulation. Comparing the two models, we found that 8 countries have maximum likelihoods that suggest R < 1 (i.e. negative growth) could not be meaningfully distinguished from R = 1.

This suggests that, despite the highly heterogeneous populations represented by these countries, the growth of COVID-19 outbreak can be reverted. Although our model cannot attribute exact causes to the global decline in transmissions rates, most countries implemented sustained, population-level social distancing efforts over a period of weeks to months. These efforts are highly likely to play a major role in reducing the transmission of COVID-19 (5).",

Social distancing measures have their own social costs. Our results suggests alternative strategies to control the virus are needed in place when social distancing efforts are relaxed. Due to the uncertainties in the impact of each specific control measures, changes to policies should be made slowly because the signal of changing transmission can take weeks to fully propagate into current data streams as a result of the long lag between infection to case confirmation (as we estimated to be approximately 2 weeks).",
