[5] The clinical spectrum of COVID-19 appears to be wide, including asymptomatic infection, mild respiratory tract illness, and severe pneumonia with respiratory failure and even death. [6] The mortality of COVID-19 is different among countries and regions, for instance 4.02% in China, 0% in Vietnam, 10.14% in Italy, 1.45% in USA\uff0cand 0.44% in Austrilia. [5] So far, studies on the epidemic and clinical characteristics of COVID-19 have mainly concentrated on initial or first-generation cases. Information about imported and second-generation cases is limited. In this study, we focused on Shaanxi province as a region with imported and second-generation cases and described the clinical and laboratory characteristics of 134 COVID-19 cases in this province with a hope to provide some insight into the prevention and treatment of the disease in China and elsewhere.",

The percentage of male patients in our data was 48.5%, different from the male patient predominence reported in two studies on Wuhan cases (73% in Huang et al [13] and 68% in Chen et al [14] ). In this study, the male-female ratio was approximately 1:1.06, with no difference between severe and non-severe cases. This finding is contradicting to the previous conclusion that men were more susceptible than women to SARS-CoV-2. [14, 15] This might be related to occupational exposures, for more men than women work as salesmen or market managers in seafood markets. As recorded, 66.0% of the patients in Huang's report and 49% of the patients in Chen's report had the history of exposure to the Huanan Seafood Market, and most of the affected patients were male workers. [13, 14] In contrast, no patient in our study had such exposure. All of these indicated a change of transmission mode outside Wuhan and that gender may not be a susceptible factor for COVID-19. [14] Similarly, severe patients were much older than non-severe patients. This suggests that age may be an important risk factor for poor outcome. The role of age in COVID-19 seems to be similar to its role in SARS and MERS, which has been reported as an independent predictor of adverse outcome.

[13, 14, 18] Only two cases in our cohort needed mechanical ventilation. This might indicate that patients outside Wuhan had a much better prognosis than the first generation patients in Wuhan. What's more, of the cases in Wuhan, those initially identified had a higher mortaility than those confirmed and treated later (15% [13] vs. 11% [14] vs. 4.3%[18]). This phenomenon was similar to that during the transmission of MERS-CoV, in which the global mortality of the first-generation MERS-CoV was about 35.5%, while that of the second-generation was around 20%. [22] Furthermore, the median interval from symptom onset to hospital admission in Shaanxi cases was shorter than in Wuhan cases (4.5 vs. 7 days). [13, 18] and the Shaanxi patients were younger than those in Wuhan (46 vs. 55-62 years). [14, 15, 18] These may be reasons for the notable reduction in mortality in Shaanxi cases.",

Similar to what was reported by Sun et al, [23] in 54.7% (69/126) of the pneumonia cases, pulmonary fibrosis was found in later chest CT images when shadowing had been resolved, and the phenomenon was more common in severe patients than in non-severe patients.

These findings suggest that SARS-CoV-2 might mainly act on lymphocytes, especially T lymphocytes, and the severity of lymphopenia might reflect the severity of the disease. Furthermore, levels of inflammatoryparameters, such as CRP and ESR elevated in COVID-19 patients and were even higher in severe patients. The changes of these laboratory parameters illustrated that the virus invaded through respiratory mucosa and spread in the body, triggering a series of immune responses and inducing severe inflammation and cytokine storm in vivo.
