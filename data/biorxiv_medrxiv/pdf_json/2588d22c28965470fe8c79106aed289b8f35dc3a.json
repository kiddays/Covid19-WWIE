We have assessed the limit of detection by parallel reaction monitoring (PRM) on an Orbitrap Eclipse mass spectrometer for target tryptic peptides of several SARS-CoV-2 proteins from a sample of virus infected Vero cells. For Nucleocapsid protein the limit of detection was found to be in the mid-attomole range (0.9 x 10 -12 g), which would theoretically correspond to approximately 10,000 SARS-CoV-2 particles, under the assumption that all viral proteins are assembled in macromolecular virus particles. Whether or not this sensitivity is sufficient to play a role in SARS-CoV-2 detection in patient material such as swabs or body fluids largely depends on the amount of viral proteins present in such samples and is subject of further research.

Thus, the rapid, sensitive and specific diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 is widely recognized to be critical in responding to this outbreak, but also for long-term improvements in patient care. Conventional methods for diagnostic testing of viral infections, which are also widely used for SARS-CoV-2 testing, are based on polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or other (multiplexed) nucleic-acid based technologies. Since its emergence late 2019 it has become clear that additional diagnostic tools that target SARS-CoV-2 should be developed to complement existing tools in a \"proactive approach\" proposed by the Coronaviridae Study Group of the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses) 1 . Alternative and/or complementary SARS-CoV-2-specific diagnostic tests are desperately needed since the current testing capacity is insufficient, amongst others because of shortages of supplies such as RNA extraction kits, PCR reagents and delivery issues for primers and probes, etc. In addition, additional testing assays are helpful in research to better understand the biological activity and potential of the virus.",

Recent developments in and targeted proteomics methods and Orbitrap mass spectrometry such as parallel reaction monitoring (PRM) have shown a substantial sensitivity increase for over the past years. Although mass spectrometry based approaches have been used in a few SARS-CoV-2 studies recently (David E. Gordon Here, we exploit the potential of mass spectrometry based proteomics technology to solve the issue of insufficient SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic testing capacity. For this, we first assess the limit of detection by PRM on an Orbitrap Eclipse for specific tryptic peptides of SARS-CoV-2 proteins. The sensitivity was found to be in the mid-attomole range (~0.9 pg) for Nucleocapsid (NCAP), which is the most abundant viral protein and therefore the most likely target candidate for tests. A rough calculation indicates that this level of sensitivity should be sufficient to detect protein amounts theoretically corresponding to approximately 10,000 SARS-CoV-2 particles. Obviously, whether or not this sensitivity is sufficient to play a role in SARS-CoV-2 detection in patient material such as swabs, mucus and other body fluids, largely depends on the amount of viral proteins present in such samples.

Upon off-line high pH reversed-phase (RP) fractionation peptide LC-MS was performed on an Orbitrap Lumos and RAW files were combined during data analysis. SARS-CoV-2 proteins were measured with high sequence coverage as exemplified in Figures 1-3 . Based on a label free semi-quantitative (LFQ) analysis of MaxQuant output data, we estimate that 4-5% of the total proteome of this sample (composed of Vero cells, viral proteins inside cells and viral particles outside of cells in the supernatant) is made up by viral proteins. Of all SARS-CoV-2 proteins covered Nucleocapsid (NCAP) is the most abundant one, making up > 88 % of all signal intensity as calculated from MaxQuant intensity values. Therefore, if intensity values can be used as a proxy for total protein mass, almost 90 % of the SARS-CoV-2 proteome would consist of NCAP. Moreover, the high number of identified Chlorocebus proteins (>6,000; see Supplementary Table 1) suggests that it is possible to not only study SARS-CoV-2 proteins, but to also investigate the effects of viral infection on the host cell proteome in great detail.",

One assumption is that the general composition of a virion is roughly 10 % RNA, 70 % proteins and 20 % lipids (weight percentages) and the genomic RNA is ~30,000 nt 3 . This would then correspond to roughly 9.0E6 Da RNA and 6.3E7 Da total protein per virion. Based on the MaxQuant LFQ intensity data we assume that ~90 % of the total SARS-CoV-2 proteome mass is composed of NCAP. This would be 5.7E7 Da, which for a 46 kDa MW proteins corresponds to 1,240 molecules. This number of Nucleocapsid copies per virion is in the same ballpark as copy numbers of 2,600 that have been reported for Nucleocapsid of other RNA (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder.

Our calculations indicate that the level of sensitivity should be sufficient to detect protein amounts theoretically corresponding to approximately 10,000 SARS-CoV-2 particles. Whether this sensitivity is sufficient for this technology to play a role in diagnostics of COVID-19 largely depends on the amount of virus material that is present in patient material such as nasopharyngeal swabs, mucus, gargle solution, remains to be seen and is subject of further research. It is likely that the majority of viral proteins in swab samples consists of (unpackaged) proteins present within cells. In addition, it is currently unknown what proportion of SARS-CoV-2 particles in clinical specimens is infectious. Data from RT-qPCR determined genome copy numbers on virus culture supernatant suggest that infectious titers are around 2 logs lower than genome copy numbers for coronaviruses (data not shown).",
