            "text": "The factors mediating fatal SARS-CoV-2 infections are poorly understood. Here, we show that cigarette smoke causes a dose-dependent upregulation of Angiotensin Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2), the SARS-CoV-2 receptor, in rodent and human lungs. Using single-cell sequencing data, we demonstrate that ACE2 is expressed in a subset of secretory cells in the respiratory tract. Chronic smoke exposure triggers the expansion of this cell population and a concomitant increase in ACE2 expression. In contrast, quitting smoking decreases the abundance of these secretory cells and reduces ACE2 levels. Finally, we demonstrate that ACE2 expression is responsive to inflammatory signaling and can be upregulated by viral infections or interferon treatment. Taken together, these results may partially explain why smokers are particularly susceptible to severe SARS-CoV-2 infections. Furthermore, our work identifies ACE2 as an interferon-stimulated gene in lung cells, suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 infections could create positive-feedback loops that increase ACE2 levels and facilitate viral dissemination.",

            "text": "In December 2019, a novel respiratory disease emerged in a seafood market in Wuhan, China 1 . Genomic sequencing demonstrated that the causative agent was a highly-contagious coronavirus, since named SARS-CoV-2 2,3 . The disease, called COVID-19, rapidly spread worldwide, and as of April 2020, more than 3 million people have been infected and more than 200,000 people have died 4 . No clinically-validated treatment or vaccine for COVID-19 is currently available. Thus, understanding the factors that mediate susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 is crucial for controlling disease transmission. Molecular analysis has begun to shed light on how SARS-CoV-2 infections occur. Like a related coronavirus that emerged in 2003 5 , SARS-CoV-2 enters human cells by binding to the extracellular domain of Angiotensin Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2) 3, 6 . Importantly, ACE2 is both necessary and sufficient for infection by SARS-CoV-2: ACE2-targeting antibodies block viral uptake in permissive cells while transgenic expression of human ACE2 allows viral entry in nonhuman cells. ACE2 normally functions in the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) by cleaving the vasoconstrictive hormone angiotensin-II into the vasodilator angiotensin 1-7 7 . Sequestration of ACE2 by coronavirus dysregulates the RAS pathway, contributing to morbidity 8 . Additionally, ACE2 levels are capable of influencing disease progression: among a cohort of mice engineered to express human ACE2, mice expressing the highest levels of ACE2 mRNA exhibited the shortest survival time following coronavirus exposure 9 . Thus, the regulation of ACE2 expression likely has a significant effect on SARS-CoV-2 susceptibility.",

ACE2 was expressed at high levels in mouse, rat, and human kidneys, consistent with its role as a regulator of the RAS pathway. ACE2 was also expressed in rodent and human lungs, the predominant location of coronavirus infections 27 . Interestingly, significant ACE2 expression was also evident in the mouse and human small intestine. Viral RNA has been detected in stool samples from patients with COVID-19 28 , and gastrointestinal symptoms have been reported in a subset of affected individuals 13 , suggesting a potential alternate route for SARS-CoV-2 transmission.

We therefore investigated whether either feature was associated with increased ACE2 expression. In four different cohorts of aging mice and one cohort of aging rats, we did not detect a significant agedependent change in ACE2 expression in the lung ( Figure 1A -B and S1D-F) 25, [30] [31] [32] [33] . Similarly, ACE2 expression in rodent lungs was not significantly different between sexes ( Figure 1C -D) 25, 34 . We next assessed the expression of ACE2 in three different human cohorts: 1) lung tissue from the Genotype-Tissue Expression project (GTEx) 23, 24 , 2) whole-lung tissue samples from organ donors 35 , and 3) pathologically-normal lung tissue from a cohort of patients analyzed as part of The Cancer Genome Atlas 36 . These datasets yielded results that were consistent with our rodent analyses: ACE2 expression was equivalent between men and women and between young individuals (<29 years) and elderly individuals (>70 years)( Figure 1E -J). In total, these findings suggest that the increased morbidity of men and older patients with COVID-19 is unlikely to result from inherent differences in the basal level of ACE2 expression in the lung.",

To investigate whether smoking could affect ACE2 levels, we first assessed gene expression in mouse lungs. We analyzed a cohort of mice exposed to diluted cigarette smoke for 2, 3, or 4 hours per day for five months 41 . Strikingly, we found a dose-dependent increase in ACE2 expression according to smoke exposure ( Figure 2A ). Mice exposed to the highest dose of cigarette smoke expressed ~80% more ACE2 in their lungs compared to sham-treated mice. To determine whether this association was present in humans as well, we assessed tissue collected from three cohorts of current smokers and never-smokers [42] [43] [44] . For these analyses, lung epithelial cells were sampled by fiberoptic bronchoscopy from either the trachea, the large airways, or the small airways ( Figure 2B ). In each cohort, we observed that tissue samples from smokers exhibited ~30%-55% more ACE2 compared to tissue from non-smokers ( Figure 2C -E). In a combined analysis comprised of data from all three tissue locations, ACE2 was in the top 2% of genes most strongly dysregulated by smoke exposure ( Figure 2F ).",

Interestingly, we observed that Cathepsin B expression, but not TMPRSS2 or Cathepsin L expression, was consistently increased in mice and humans exposed to cigarette smoke ( Figure S3 ). In a metaanalysis across the trachea, large airways, and small airways, Cathepsin B was in the top 11% of genes dysregulated in the respiratory tract of cigarette smokers ( Figure S3D ).

Smoking caused an increase in both the number of ACE2+ positive cells and in ACE2 expression within ACE2+ cells ( Figure 4G -H).

As our single-cell analysis suggested that the coronavirus receptor ACE2 is expressed at higher levels in differentiated secretory and ciliated cells compared to basal stem cells, we investigated whether in vitro mucociliary differentiation increases ACE2 expression. Indeed, in mouse tracheal extracts 79 and primary human lung cells 80 , mucociliary differentiation resulted in a highly-significant upregulation of ACE2 ( Figure 4K -L). Finally, to investigate the link between smoking, differentiation, and ACE2 expression, we examined data from human bronchial epithelial cells cultured at an ALI in which cells were either exposed to clean air or to diluted cigarette smoke 81 . Remarkably, treatment with cigarette smoke during in vitro differentiation resulted in a significant upregulation of ACE2 relative to cells that were differentiated in clean air ( Figure 4M ). Smoke exposure increased ACE2 expression by ~42%, comparable to the increases that we observed between the lungs of non-smokers and smokers ( Figure 2 ). Differentiation in the presence of cigarette smoke similarly resulted in an upregulation of the goblet/club cell transcriptional signature and a downregulation of the ciliated cell transcriptional signature ( Figure  4N ). In full, our results demonstrate that a subset of lung secretory cells express the coronavirus receptor ACE2, and cigarette smoke promotes the expansion of this cell population.",

Indeed, we observed increased ACE2 expression in multiple cohorts of patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF)( Figure S3A -D) [82] [83] [84] [85] . Interestingly, both COPD and IPF are strongly associated with prior cigarette exposure 86, 87 , and COPD in particular has been identified as a risk factor for severe COVID-19 16, 88 . However, ACE2 expression was generally not affected by other lung conditions or toxins. We did not observe a significant difference in ACE2 expression in lung samples from a large cohort of patients with asthma or from patients with the lung disease sarcoidosis ( Figure S3E -F) 89, 90 . Similarly, ACE2 expression was unaltered in lung tissue from a mouse model of cystic fibrosis and in mice exposed to a variety of carcinogens, including arsenic, ionizing radiation (IR), and 1,3-butadiene ( Figure S3G -J) [91] [92] [93] [94] . We conclude that ACE2 upregulation in the lung is tightly associated with a history of cigarette smoking and is not a universal response to pulmonary diseases.",

Cytokine release can be triggered by viral infections, which serve to induce immune cell activation and expansion 95 . Cigarette smoke is also an inflammatory agent, and smokers tend to exhibit an increase in inflammation-related serological markers 96, 97 . To investigate a potential link between inflammation and the expression of the host factors required for coronavirus infections, we first examined the levels of ACE2 in published datasets of respiratory epithelial cells challenged with different viruses. We observed a highly significant upregulation of ACE2 in airway cells that were infected with two RNA viruses, influenza and Respiratory Syncytial Virus ( Figure 5A -B) 98 . Infection with two coronaviruses, SARS and MERS, that are closely related to the 2019 pandemic strain also caused an increase in ACE2 levels ( Figure 5C -D) 99, 100 . Double-stranded RNA that is produced during viral replication can be detected by host pattern recognition receptors, triggering a strong immune response 101 . Accordingly, transfection of the dsRNA mimic poly(I:C) into airway epithelial cells was sufficient to induce the upregulation of ACE2 ( Figure 5E ) 102 . These results reveal that inflammatory signals -like those triggered by smoking or by a viral infection -are capable of increasing the expression of ACE2 in the respiratory epithelium.",

IFN-a, IFN-b, and IFN-g treatment increased ACE2 expression in tracheal cells, while only IFN-a and IFN-b affected ACE2 in small airway cells. To further verify these results, we re-analyzed a published gene expression dataset of airway epithelial cells exposed to IFN-b, and we found a similar increase in ACE2 levels following interferon treatment ( Figure 5H ) 103, 104 .

Next, we compared ACE2 RNA levels with ACE2 immunohistochemistry staining in untransformed human tissues. We similarly observed a strong correlation between ACE2 RNA and protein staining: five of the six tissues with the highest levels of RNA expression exhibited strong staining, while none of the 35 other tissues with lower RNA levels exhibited strong staining ( Figure S4C ) 108 . Lastly, we directly compared ACE2 expression in seven human cell lines by qRT-PCR and by western blotting. We found that cell lines that displayed the highest levels of ACE2 RNA (LoVo, Caco-2, and Calu3) also exhibited the most ACE2 protein, while cell lines with very low levels of ACE2 RNA (HCT116, CAL148, and A2780) had undetectable levels of ACE2 protein ( Figure S4D -E). Thus, while we cannot rule out the possibility that ACE2 RNA and protein levels are differentially regulated in certain circumstances, our analysis reveals that ACE2 RNA and protein levels are generally correlated.",

Here, we show that cigarette smokers harbor consistently higher levels of the SARS-CoV-2 receptor ACE2 in their respiratory tracts. This upregulation is likely mediated by the expansion of ACE2+ secretory cells caused by chronic smoke exposure. Certain inflammatory cytokines also trigger ACE2 upregulation, which could further influence ACE2 expression due to smoking-associated lung inflammation. The overabundance of ACE2 in the lungs of smokers may partially explain why smokers are significantly more likely to develop severe SARS-CoV-2 infections that require aggressive medical interventions 13, 16, 17, 37 . Furthermore, as quitting smoking is associated with a decrease in ACE2 expression, it is possible that giving up cigarettes may reduce susceptibility to deadly COVID-19.",

In particular, it has been reported that nicotine and/or cigarette smoke has the potential to downregulate ACE2 expression in certain tissues or cell types [109] [110] [111] [112] . In this manuscript, we focused our analysis on factors affecting ACE2 expression in the mammalian lungs and associated respiratory epithelia. We observed a consistent correlation between smoking history and ACE2 expression that was dose-dependent ( Figure 2G-H) , that could be recapitulated in mice ( Figure 2A ) and in vitro ( Figure 4M ), that was detectable in both bulk and single-cell analyses ( Figure 2F and 4G-H), and that remained significant when controlling for other demographic variables (Table 1) . Thus, we propose that cigarette smoke causes the upregulation of ACE2 expression in the respiratory tract. However, we recognize that individual components found within cigarettes, like nicotine, may have a different effect on ACE2 than whole smoke, and smoking itself could alter ACE2 levels in non-respiratory organs in different ways 110 .",

Alternately, ACE2 may be expressed in mesenchymal or other lineages within the lung, and our inability to detect it may be a limitation of the single-cell samples that we analyzed. Nonetheless, by examining datasets from both mice and humans, and by including cells collected from bronchial brushing, we demonstrated consistently high levels of ACE2 transcripts in the secretory cells that participate in mucociliary clearance 48 .

Notably, prolonged smoke exposure triggers secretory cell hyperplasia, thereby increasing the production of mucous in the respiratory tract [64] [65] [66] . We found that this smoking-induced expansion of secretory cells also causes an increase in ACE2 levels, as smoking doubled the number of cells co-expressing ACE2 and MUC5AC. Additionally, consistent with a recent report 122 , we found that ACE2 is an interferonregulated gene, and is over-expressed in lung epithelial cells following viral infection or interferon treatment. Lung damage and inflammation caused by smoking could also contribute to ACE2 upregulation. Additionally, we speculate that the interferon-dependent upregulation of ACE2 could create a positive-feedback loop for SARS-CoV-2 infections. That is, interferon secretion following an initial infection could increase ACE2 expression within neighboring cells, thereby rendering those cells susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 and facilitating viral dissemination. Accordingly, clinical interventions to dampen the immune response could benefit patients in part by breaking this positive-feedback cycle 22, 129 .",

In the literature, ACE2 expression in the lung has been reported to both increase 133 and decrease 120,134 during aging. Across five rodent and three human datasets, we did not observe a significant correlation in either direction between ACE2 levels and age. It remains possible that such a difference could be found using tissue from older or younger individuals. Additionally, it is possible that ACE2 expression within single cell types correlates with age, but such differences are not prominent enough to detect using bulk microarray and RNA-Seq analysis.",

In general, we have documented a strong correlation between ACE2 mRNA and protein levels ( Figure S4 ), but it remains possible that ACE2 protein is differentially regulated in mammalian lungs, or that the localization of ACE2 protein to the cell surface is strictly controlled. Immunohistochemistry using tissue samples from smokers and virusinfected patients will be needed to confirm that these factors also increase the levels of ACE2 protein available to interact with SARS-CoV-2 particles.",

Mice that were engineered to express high levels of human ACE2 succumbed to infections with the SARS coronavirus more quickly than mice that expressed low levels of human ACE2, suggesting that increasing ACE2 enhances viral susceptibility 9 . At the same time, ACE2-knockout mice are vulnerable to a variety of lung injuries, and ACE2 expression has been reported to play a protective role in the respiratory tract 8, 135, 136 . As ACE2 expression is both necessary and sufficient for SARS-CoV-2 infections 6,137 , it seems highly likely that an expansion of ACE2+ cells in the lungs will facilitate viral dissemination, but it remains possible that the presence of ACE2 has some beneficial functions as well.
