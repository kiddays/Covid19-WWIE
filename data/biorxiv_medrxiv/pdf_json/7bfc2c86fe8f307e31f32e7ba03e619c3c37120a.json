One has been the critical shortage of personal protective equipment (PPE) for healthcare workers (HCWs) on the frontlines of the pandemic response. 1, 2 Single-use disposable PPE such as N95 Filtering Facepiece Respirators (FFR) and surgical facemasks are being worn for extended periods or are reused until they become soiled or visibly damaged. Shortages of PPE have been detrimental to the morale of HCWs and places them at risk for infection, death and disability. [3] [4] [5] Given these extraordinary challenges, it has become vital to devise novel alternative methods to reuse PPE safely and effectively.",

It has subsequently modified its guidance regarding PPE required while caring for patients with SARS-CoV-2. 8 At present, both the CDC and the World Health Organization (WHO) recommend the use of N95 FFR for all aerosol-generating procedures (AGP) performed on confirmed COVID-19 patients and persons under investigation (PUI). 9, 10 Given the shortage of N95 respirators, the CDC has provided updated guidance for extended use and limited reuse of these respirators by HCWs. 11 Several strategies have been proposed for conserving the supply of PPE including repurposing other devices to be used as FFRs, creating FFRs at home and decontamination of N95s using methods such as ultraviolet-C germicidal irradiation, dry heat, moist heat, and vaporized hydrogen peroxide. [12] [13] [14] [15] Vaporized hydrogen peroxide (VHP) has provided the most promising results and was recently given provisional US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) for decontamination of used N95 respirators. 16 Although the availability of VHP decontamination is an important development, the process is labor and time-intensive due to a long treatment cycle and also requires the shipment of used N95 respirators to and from a central processing center. 17 There remains an urgent need for an effective N95 respirator disinfection process that will allow on-site reprocessing with rapid turnaround times, ease of use with existing personnel and expertise, and flexibility and .

Ideally, the process should allow for the disinfection of other PPE, such as gowns, surgical face masks, powered air-purifying respirator (PAPR) hoods, and face shields as the needs arise. We previously reported that a high-level disinfection cabinet that generates aerosolized peracetic acid (PAA) and hydrogen peroxide was effective for disinfection of N95 respirators. 18 Here, we expanded on these promising findings by evaluating the use of the same technology on a much larger scale for whole-room disinfection of a large number of respirators and evaluated the impact of the treatment on mask performance.",

We found that the PAA room disinfection system was easy to set up, operate and was effective for disinfection of N95 respirators with a total cycle time of 1 hour and 16 minutes. Using multiple methods, we did not detect any adverse effects on filtration efficiency, structural integrity, or strap elasticity after 5 treatment cycles. There was no detectable off-gassing of PAA from the treated masks.

[30] [31] [32] G. stearothermophilus spores have been used in the study of PAA decontamination of surfaces. 33 Our findings are consistent with previous studies that demonstrated the efficacy of the PAA disinfection system. Both the room HLDS and a high-level disinfection cabinet were effective in reducing pathogens, including C. difficile spores, on steel disk carriers by greater than 6 log10 CFU. 24, 34 However, an extended cycle with the disinfection cabinet was required to achieve a 6 log10 reduction in bacteriophage MS2 inoculated on N95 respirators. 18 In the current study, an extended cycle was also required to achieve a 6 log10 reduction in bacteriophage MS2 or G. stearothermophilus spores on N95 respirators. Similarly, Battelle has reported a prolonged VHP cycle time with a total time of 480 minutes for N95 decontamination. 17 Our results demonstrate that the N95 respirators retain their structural integrity, outer surface hydrophobicity and strap elasticity for at least 5 repeated cycles of PAA treatment. However, on a microscopic level, there was evidence of visible bubbling on the non-woven polypropylene fibers of the outer layer, which increased proportionally with the duration of exposure to PAA. The significance of these bubbles are unclear at this time.",

The technology is substantially more effective than ultraviolet-C light for N95 decontamination. 18 The platform is scalable and can be set up in real-world hospital settings. We conservatively estimate that about 2000 N95 respirators could be effectively disinfected in a room with the dimensions of the test room (2447 cu. ft), with capacity increasing proportionally to the room dimensions. The PAA room HLDS is currently used for terminal disinfection of patient rooms in some centers across the US and abroad. It can be readily repurposed for N95 decontamination without much added costs. PAA works at room temperatures and requires a shorter cycle time than many other disinfection methods. While the use of VHP is not recommended with cellulose-containing materials, PAA could potentially be used with masks containing cellulose.",

The deploy and dwell times are directly responsible for microbial reduction, whereas the scrub and the vent cycles impact clearance of residual PAA vapors to recommended safe levels. There are no specific OSHA standards for PAA. 20 The American Conference of Governmental Hygienists (ACGIH) recommends a Threshold Limit Value (TLV) of 0.4 ppm, as a 15-minute Short Term Exposure Limit (STEL). 20-22 The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) recommended Acute Exposure Guidelines (AEGL-1) limit is 0.17 ppm/0.52 mg/m 2 . 23Before the start of the disinfection cycle, the deploy, dwell, scrub and vent phase times were manually configured using the application programming interface (API) on the accompanying digital tablet(Figure 2), which in turn, remotely connected to the HLDS using Bluetooth\u00ae technology. The deploy and the dwell times were adjusted to provide effective disinfection of the masks with the least possible amount of exposure to the PAA. The PAA concentrations in the room were measured in real-time by a PAA sensor (Safecide\u2122, chemDAQ, Pittsburgh, PA).At the end of the vent cycle, PAA concentrations were at 0.12 ppm, below the AEGL-1 limit of 0.17 ppm (Figure 3). The 15-minute time-weighted average (TWA) of PAA concentration after the decontamination cycle was 0.08 ppm (15-min STEL for PAA is 0.4 ppm).",

Structural integrity of the N95 masks following exposure to aerosolized PAA: SEM analysis indicated evidence of bubbles on the surface of the PAA-treated respirator outer fabric fibers which appeared to increase with the number of PAA cycles (Figure 6A-F).
