The prospect of immune age reduction, 7 by reverting induced glycosylation changes through metabolic intervention, opens many 8 possibilities. Herein, we have investigated whether weight loss interventions affect 9 inflammation-and ageing-related glycosylation alterations, in a longitudinal cohort of 10 bariatric-surgery patients.

Namely, it has been shown that hyposialylated IgG (corresponding to an 94 \"old\" IgG glycome) can induce obesity-related hypertension and insulin resistance in B-cell-95 deficient mice, through activation of the endothelial Fc\u03b3RIIB (22,23). These findings indicate 96 that the IgG N-glycome could represent more than a biomarker of inflammation and aging, 97 since distinctive IgG glycoforms act as effector molecules in certain pathologies. Furthermore, 98 supplementation with N-acetylmannosamine (ManNAc), a precursor of sialic acid, protects 99 obese mice from hypertension and insulin resistance induction by reverting an \"old\" IgG N-100 glycome into a \"young\" one (23,24). However, studies exploring the possibilities of converting 101 an \"old\" IgG glycome into a \"young\" one by metabolic intervention in humans are limited. Of 102 note, only one small study indicated that high-intensity interval training can \"rejuvenate\" the 103 IgG N-glycome (25). 104",

The glycosylation alterations induced by a low-calorie diet are showing 360 exactly the opposite direction of change than those seen in various inflammatory conditions, 361 such as type 2 diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and inflammatory bowel 362 disease (16,29,34,35), suggesting a gradual attenuation of inflammation. Interestingly, no 363 significant changes were found for the IgG N-glycome alone after the diet, probably due to 364 the relatively short follow-up period (3 weeks), which matches IgG serum half-life. Altogether, 365 our glycomic data suggest that the overall inflammatory body status improves after a short 366 time of low-calorie diet, reflecting a quickly noticeable and beneficial metabolic effect. 367",

Converesely, IgG 380 galactosylation levels substantially decrease with ageing and during inflammation (11,13).

Interestingly, the same group made another 400 significant discovery -promotion of IgG sialylation breaks the link between obesity and 401 hypertension/insulin resistance (23,24). Namely, supplementation with the sialic acid 402 precursor restored IgG sialylation, highlighting a potential approach to improve both 403 metabolic and cardiovascular health in humans, with a single intervention. Our data suggest 404 that a similar effect might be achieved by weight loss interventions, through restoring of IgG 405 sialylation levels. Altogether, it is quite fascinating that such marked effects could be observed 406 on a rather small number of participants, which further highlights their significance in a given 407 biological setting. 408 409 Lastly, in order to confirm the effects of weight loss on the biological/immune age, we 410 investigated how BMI decrease affects IgG N-glycome during a 20-year-period.

In brief, IgG was isolated in a high-throughput manner, using 96-well protein G 154 monolithic plates (BIA Separations, Slovenia), starting from 100 \u03bcl of plasma. Plasma was 155 diluted 7\u00d7 with phosphate buffered saline (PBS; Merck, Germany) and applied to the protein 156G plate. IgG was eluted with 1 ml of 0.1 M formic acid (Merck, Germany) and immediately 157 neutralized with 1 M ammonium bicarbonate (Acros Organics, USA). 158 N-glycan release from IgG and total plasma proteins 159 Isolated IgG samples were dried in a vacuum centrifuge. After drying, IgG was denatured with 160 the addition of 30 \u03bcl of 1.33% SDS (w/v) (Invitrogen, USA) and by incubation at 65 \u00b0C for 10 161 min. Plasma samples (10 \u03bcl) were denatured with the addition of 20 \u03bcl of 2% (w/v) SDS 162 (Invitrogen, USA) and by incubation at 65 \u00b0C for 10 min. From this point on, the procedure was 163 identical for both IgG and plasma samples.

To each sample 25 \u03bcl of labelling mixture was added, followed 172 by 2 h incubation at 65 \u00b0C. Free label and reducing agent were removed from the samples 173 using hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography solid-phase extraction (HILIC-SPE).
