The development of severe disease and mortality is higher in older individuals, males and those with other co-morbidities, and may vary across ethnic groups. However, so far, no host genetic factor has been clearly associated with susceptibility and development of severe disease. To understand the impact of host genetics on expression of ACE2 (SARS-CoV-2 receptor) during RNA virus infection we performed a GWAS for ACE2 expression in HCV-infected liver tissue from 195 individuals. We discovered that polymorphisms in the host IFNL region which control expression of IFNL3 and IFNL4 modulate ACE2 expression. ACE2 expression was regulated additionally by age, with a subsidiary effect of co-morbidity. The IFNL locus controlled expression of a gene network incorporating many well-known interferon-stimulated genes which anticorrelated with ACE2 transcript levels. The same anti-correlation was found in the gastrointestinal tract, a site of SARS-CoV-2 replication where inflammation driven interferon-stimulated genes are negatively correlated with ACE2 expression. The interferon dependent regulation of ACE2 was identified in a murine model of SARS-CoV-1 suggesting conserved regulation of ACE2 across species. Polymorphisms in the IFNL region, as well as age, may impact not only on classical antiviral responses but also on ACE2 with potential consequences for clinical outcomes in distinct ethnic groups and with implications for therapeutic interventions.",

Patients harbouring the impaired IFN-\u03bb4-S70 variant display lower hepatic interferon-stimulated gene (ISG) expression levels, which is associated with increased HCV clearance following acute infection and a better response to IFN-based therapy, compared to patients carrying the more active IFN-\u03bb4-P70 variant 16 . After imputing and phasing IFNL4 rs368234815 and rs117648444 we observed three haplotypes: TT/G (IFN-\u03bb4-Null); \u0394G/G (IFN-\u03bb4-P70) and \u0394G/A (IFN-\u03bb4-S70).

This has been explored in HCV, where a slower, but sustained impact of IFNL signalling is seen 24 . In vitro studies have revealed that ISG expression and anti-viral activity induced by recombinant IFNL4 are comparable to that induced by IFNL3 25 . Importantly, however, the tight regulation of IFNL4 26 means its ability to respond and induce a rapid antiviral state may be limited 27 as seen both in vitro, and in vivo 28 . However, once established, the IFNL4 transcriptional module may also be highly sustained (as seen here and in other HCV cohorts 16 ) and also noted elsewhere, e.g. after childbirth 29 .",

            "text": "In mice, the type III IFN response is restricted largely to mucosal epithelial tissues, with the lung epithelium responding to both type I and III IFNs 30 and intestinal epithelial cells responding exclusively to type III IFNs. Among nonhematopoietic cells, epithelial cells are potent producers of type III IFNs. In mouse models, type III IFNs seem to be the primary type of IFN found in the bronchoalveolar lavage in response to influenza A virus infection and play a critical role in host defence 31 . Intriguingly, in humans, the IFNL4 polymorphism identified here is associated with the outcome of RNA virus respiratory tract infections in children, with the non-CC variant showing a poorer outcome 32 . The data from the GI tract indicate that this gene expression pattern is conserved amongst tissues, consistent with emerging data 33 . Inflammatory signals may act to sustain the triggering of ISGs and sustain downregulation of ACE2. Of note for inflammatory bowel disease, loss of ACE2 in the ileum impacts on secretion of antimicrobial peptides and the local microbiome 34 . Downregulation of ACE2 itself may limit the ability of coronaviruses to enter cells, but may, if sustained, have impacts on inflammation. Indeed ACE2 -/mice suffer from enhanced disease following virus infection of the lung through an angiotensin-driven mechanism 35 . In other settings, the nonCC genotype may provide a more limited early response 26 and lead to more sustained activation of the IFNL pathway 29 than CC genotype (Supplementary Figure 12 and 13) although overall the issue of which genotype might be protective in COVID-19 remains open. We also note the impact of ageing, which blunts this response in both genotypes. The mechanism for this requires further study, as does the impact of gender. These data and model are also consistent with transient upregulation of ACE2 seen in early time points by IFN\u03b1 in vitro 36 but the full kinetics need further study in vitro and in vivo.",

Both liver RNA trascriptomic and human genome-wide SNP data were obtained on a total of 190 patients of mainly White self-reported ancestry infected with HCV subtype 3a. After quality control and filtering of the human genotype data, approximately 330,000 common SNPs with minor allele frequency greater than 5% were available for analysis. The Phasing and imputation was performed using SHAPEIT2 46 and IMPUTE2 47 version 2.3.1 using default settings and the 1000 Genomes Phase III dataset as a reference population 48 . After QC, the imputation data for 182 patients were of high quality. Imputation quality for samples included for rs117648444 and rs368234815 variants (information 0.974 and 0.994 respectively and certainty 0.995 and 0.997 respectively).
