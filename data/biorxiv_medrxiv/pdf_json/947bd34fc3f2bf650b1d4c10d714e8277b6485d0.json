SMH would need to create 86 new ICU beds, while SJHC would need to reduce its ICU beds for non-COVID care by 72%. Uncertainty in local epidemiological features was more influential than uncertainty in clinical severity. If physical distancing reduces contacts by 20%, maximizing the diagnostic capacity or syndromic diagnoses at the community-level could avoid a surge at each hospital.",

By March 6, 2020, there was direct evidence of local onward transmission in Canada (2) . Local transmission refers to acquisition within a geographical locale (in this case, within Canada) but without a direct link to a travel-acquired case. Early evidence from China suggests that among patients diagnosed with COVID-19, 13.8% develop severe disease and 6.1% develop critical illness (3) . Thus, an important component of responding to local onward transmission is preparing for a surge in inpatient and intensive care needs for patients with COVID-19 (4) (5) (6) .",

Despite similar underlying epidemics, the fast/large and default epidemics project different health-care needs driven by differences in probability of severe disease. In the absence of further interventions, ICU admissions in the small/slow epidemic still surpass the daily number of ICU admissions in 2019 (Figure 3c ). Appendix 2 Table 2 .2 summarizes the peak number of admissions, and peak in daily census (prevalence) of inpatients within the first 300 days of the outbreak. Across all plausible scenarios, the IQR of peak prevalence in number of non-ICU inpatients with COVID-19 ranges between 10,189 and 38,502; and for ICU inpatients ranges between 2,454 and 17,651. In the default scenario, the model estimates a peak of 32,368 non-ICU and 7,418 ICU inpatient beds needed to care for patients with COVID-19 in the GTA. Thus, the total daily census of non-ICU and ICU inpatients, with or without COVID-19 is shown in Figure 4 and Figure 5 respectively for St. Michael's Hospital, and in Appendix 2 for St. Joseph's Health Centre (Figure 2.2 and 2.3) . The model estimates that if nothing changes with the baseline (pre-outbreak) levels of admissions, both hospitals will surpass non-ICU and ICU capacity under the fast/large and default scenarios within 90 days of the outbreak, but (as expected based on Figure 3c ) that may not be the case with the small/slow epidemic ( Table 2 provides the daily census (prevalence) of inpatients with COVID-19 from each scenario, the median and IQR of the full range of constrained model outputs for the 6 catchment of each hospital, and the relative reduction in non-COVID admissions or absolute increase in ICU beds needed to address the surge at each site. In the default scenario, for St. Michael's Hospital to remain below its non-ICU bed capacity 90 days into the outbreaks, the hospital would need to reduce non-ICU inpatient care for non-COVID by 70%, to open up 279 non-ICU inpatient beds; St. Michael's Hospital would also need to create 86 new ICU-beds in addition to its current capacity of 71 beds to be able to care for non-COVID and new COVID-related ICU inpatients ( Table 2 ). At St. Joseph's Health Centre, under the default scenario, non-ICU beds and ICU-beds for non-COVID would need to be reduced by 58% and 72%, respectively, to open up 217 non-ICU beds and 13 ICU beds by 90 days into the outbreak, to remain below the hospital's respective bed capacity ( Table 2) .",

Results of sensitivity analyses were similar for St. Joseph's Health Centre. At the hospital-level, uncertainty in local epidemiological features was more influential than uncertainty in clinical severity. For example, uncertainty in local seeding ( Figure  6a ) has a larger influence on non-ICU care at St. Michael's Hospital than uncertainty in clinical severity (Figure 6b) . The effect of early versus delayed initiation of physical distancing has a large impact as shown in Figure 6c . If physical distancing could only reduce contact rates by 20%, then maximizing the diagnostic capacity or syndromic diagnosis at the community-level in the GTA could reduce the surge at St. Michael's hospital from 285 to 40 non-ICU patients with COVID-19 and 101 to 10 ICU patients with COVID-19 by day 90 of the outbreak.",

However, the impact of the city's outbreak is expected to vary across hospitals by their local catchment, with local epidemic features driving each hospital's surge. The local transmission dynamics, or what was happening with the epidemic overall in the city, had a larger influence on a hospital's surge than uncertainty around disease severity. As such, community-level interventions, like maximizing diagnosis (via testing, or via syndromic case finding) among symptomatic individuals in the community could potentially mitigate the surge in each hospital.",

The preliminary hospitalspecific findings (on March 4, 2020) were used to prepare for the local surge at the two hospitals. First, the hospitals opened up beds by temporarily cancelling non-essential surgeries and procedures. Second, as most COVID-related inpatient care would fall under the hospitalist and medicine services, the relevant departments rapidly set up a separate service with a viable back-up system and ability for rapid scale up in anticipation of increasing cases requiring admission, and staffing short-falls due to infection, exposure, or while awaiting test results if symptomatic. Third, ambulatory clinics were reduced with a focus on virtual care and urgent assessments only; this allowed clinic space to be consolidated to preserve personal protective equipment and human resources (including physicians) for deployment to other areas. This consolidation also allowed identification of potential inpatient spaces. There was also a change in health-care use by the public: non-COVID medicine admissions are dropping across the city and country (29). Thus, the next iteration of analyses will need to account for active and passive reductions in admissions.",

However, distribution of admissions may be expected to follow even more granular patterns of transmission in the hospital's neighborhood-level catchment area (30). Future work includes capturing heterogeneity within the five health units and near real-time adjustment of the catchment using observed patterns of hospital-specific admissions. Finally, our objective was to conduct a scenario-based analyses, and not to explicitly fit the model to observed cases, hospitalizations, ICU admissions and deaths in the GTA; these are the next step in supporting local GTA hospitals and re-distribution of ICU care across the city (31).",

The observed data on cumulative detected cases for the Greater Toronto Area (travel-related, and local transmission) up to March 20, 2020 are also shown (dashed black line) as part of the face validity check. The model output for the fast/large epidemic is shown in green and slow/small epidemic in blue, selected as the upper and lower quartile of peak incidence, respectively, within the first 300 days. The default (solid red line) depicts the default scenario (Table 1) . Simulated timeline begins at the start of the 'seeding' of the population with 0.0011-0.0048% of the population already infected with SARS-Cov-2. For observed data, we define outbreak started when 3 confirmed cases were observed. We chose 3 cases detected as the onset of epidemic based on the observed epidemic curve in the Greater Toronto Area, where the curve started to take off after detection of 3 cases. We applied the same threshold for other regions for comparability of epidemic curves across geographic locations. Abbreviations: GTA: Greater Toronto Area.",
