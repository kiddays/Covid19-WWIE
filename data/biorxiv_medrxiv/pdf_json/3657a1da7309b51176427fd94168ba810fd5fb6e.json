CQ = chloroquine. There was no delay to patency of first blood-stage P. cynomolgi infection in either low-or 285 high-dose ivermectin groups (Figure 2 ). Ivermectin displayed \u00b5M levels of liver schizont efficacy 286 in vitro, however, a lack of delay to blood-stage patency suggests minimal impact of ivermectin 287 on liver schizont development. Admittedly, the injection of one million P. cynomolgi sporozoites 288 into the macaque sets a very high bar for any drug as it only requires one sporozoite to develop 289 into a liver schizont to continue the blood-stage malaria infection. This is in contrast to a single 290 mosquito that is predicted to deliver <100 sporozoites during blood feeding (21) To the best of our knowledge this is highest repeated dose ivermectin pharmacokinetic 300 investigation in any mammal species. There were no significant changes in the Cl/F or T 1/2 . It 301 should be noted that this study had a small sample size, only three macaques per ivermectin-302 treated group, and thus ivermectin autoinhibition warrants further evaluation in future trials.

There was a slight 258 reduction in peak concentrations achieved and delay in time to achieve peak concentrations 259 when comparing the first and seventh doses.

One monkey vomited the first dose of ivermectin (1.2 mg/kg) when administered 265 as monotherapy but had no emesis upon further dosing. Emesis was observed previously in 266 ivermectin-treated macaques receiving 2 mg/kg single dose, and the occurrence of emesis 267 increased with higher doses (4, 6, 8, 12, and 24 mg/kg) (17, 18). The combination of ivermectin 268 (0.6 and 1.2 mg/kg) and chloroquine (10 mg/kg) for seven days was safe and well-tolerated in 269 macaques.. This suggests that this combination could be used in humans during P. vivax MDAs 270 in regions where chloroquine is still an effective P. vivax blood-stage therapeutic. 271 Prophylactic mode in vitro results with ivermectin parent compound indicate effect of 272 ivermectin against P. cynomolgi liver schizonts and hypnozoites (Figure 1), but at higher 273 concentrations than could be safely achieved in humans (10). However, there is a growing body 274 of evidence that the activity of ivermectin is not restricted to the parent compound alone and that 275 ivermectin metabolites may be active as well. Indeed, when comparing the effect of ivermectin 276 metabolized by a human to that of parent compound mixed in human blood, the mosquito-lethal 277 effect against Anopheles dirus and Anopheles minimus was 20-to 35-fold more potent (5) and 278 the sporontocidal effect against P. vivax development in An. aquasalis was 5-fold lower (20). 279Even though P. berghei in vitro liver-stage IC 50 s were in the \u00b5g/ml range, liver schizont inhibition 280 in vivo with ivermectin at doses plausible for use in humans (8). The points above 281 warranted evaluation of ivermectin against P. cynomolgi in Rhesus macaques even though in 282 vitro IC 50 s were in the \u00b5g/ml range and ivermectin only reaches ng/ml concentrations in orally-283 treated hosts. 284",

Novel methods of Plasmodium knowlesi control, such as treatment of wild 334 primates with ivermectin baits to target wild Anopheles populations could potentially be 335 evaluated in this ivermectin macaque model system. 336 Although ivermectin was able to inhibit liver-stage development of P. cynomolgi in vitro, 337 no demonstrable effect was observed with in vivo macaque challenge. Repeated doses of 338 ivermectin (0.3, 0.6, 1.2 mg/kg) for seven days in macaques was safe with a corresponding rise 339 in drug exposures (AUC), but no signs of autoinhibition.

Real Time PCR 433 reaction was carried out in a total of 25 \u00b5l reaction using Rotor-Gene Multiplex PCR kit (Qiagen, 434 Hilden, Germany) and a final concentration of primer and probe at 0.5 \u00b5m and 0.2 \u00b5m, 435 respectively. PCR cycling condition consists of PCR initial activation step at 95\u00b0C for 5 mins 436 followed by 45 cycles of denaturation at 95\u00b0C for 15 secs and annealing /extension at 60\u00b0C for 437 15 secs. The fluorescence data was acquired during annealing/extension step. Blood from a 438 macaque (R915) previously infected with P. cynomolgi was used as a positive control and a 439 cutoff at cycle 36 was used to define P. cynomolgi positive samples in this study.440 441 Pharmacokinetics 442",

The total run time was 7 462 min and the injection volume was 5 \u00b5l. For mass spectrometry was set in the positive 463 electrospray ionization mode with multiple reaction monitoring. Instrument parameters included 464 capillary voltage of 3.5 kv, source and desolvation temperature of 150 and 400\u02daC, respectively. 465 The nitrogen generator was set at 120 lb/in 2 to generate cone and desolvation gas flow of 50 466 and 800 L/H, respectively. The mass transitions were observed at m/Z 892.77\uf0e0569.50 and 467 894.79\uf0e0571.52 for ivermectin and ivermectin-D2, respectively. Masslynx\u2122 software (Waters 468 Corp., Milford, MA, USA) was used for quantification. 469 470 Pharmacokinetic analysis 471 Noncompartmental analysis (NCA) was used to generate pharmacokinetic parameters using 472 Phoenix WinNonlin 8.1 (Certara USA, Inc., NJ, USA). The PK parameters determined were the 473 elimination half-life (T 1/2 ), maximum concentration in plasma (C max ), time to reach C max after 474 dosing (T max ), area under the concentration-time curve in 24 hour (AUC 24hr ), area under the 475 time curve after the last dose to infinity (AUC INF ) and percentage of AUC INF due to 476 extrapolation from T last (last collection time point) to infinity (AUC %Extrap ) and since the fraction of 477 dose absorbed cannot be estimated for extravascular models, apparent volume of distribution 478 (Vz/F) and apparent clearance (CL/F) were substituted for V and CL. Data analysis and 479 graphical representation were completed using GraphPad Prism version 8.0. 480 481 Pharmacokinetic modeling and simulation 482 Generated NCA pharmacokinetic parameters were used as parameters estimates for 483 compartment modelling. Observed ivermectin concentration were best described by one 484 compartment analysis with first order absorption and first order elimination. 485 486 Ethical Statement 487 The USAMD-AFRIMS Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee and the Animal Use Review 488 Division, U.S. Army Medical Research and Materiel Command, reviewed and approved this 489 study (PN 16-03).
