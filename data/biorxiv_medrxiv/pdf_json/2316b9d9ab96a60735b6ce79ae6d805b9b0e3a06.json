Here we propose exit strategies from lockdown that provide sustainable, albeit reduced, economic activity. We use mathematical models to show that a cyclic schedule of 4-day work and 10-day lockdown, or similar variants, can prevent resurgence of the epidemic while providing part-time employment. The cycle pushes the reproduction number R below one by reduced exposure time and by exploiting the virus latent period: those infected during work days reach peak infectiousness during lockdown days. The number of work days can be adapted in response to observations. Throughout, full epidemiological measures need to continue including hygiene, physical distancing, compartmentalization, testing and contact tracing. This conceptual framework, when combined with other interventions to control the epidemic, can offer the beginnings of predictability to many economic sectors.",

Once a lockdown has reduced the number of critical cases to a desired goal, a decision must be reached on how to exit it responsibly. The main concern is the risk of resurgence of the epidemic. One strategy proposes reinstating lockdown when a threshold number of critical cases is exceeded in a resurgence, and stopping lockdown again once cases drop below a low threshold 2,5,6 ( Fig  1A,S1 ).

Simulation used a SEIR-Erlang deterministic model with mean latent period of 3 days and infectious periods of 4 days. Results are robust to uncertainty in model parameters (Fig S2) . An important consideration is that the cyclic strategy is adaptive, and can be tuned when conditions change and the effects of the approach are monitored. For example, weather conditions may affect R 5,6 , as well as advances in regional monitoring and contact tracing. If one detects, for example, that a 4:10 strategy leads to an increasing trend in cases, one can shift to a cycle with fewer work days. Conversely, if a strong decreasing trend is observed, one can shift to more work days and gain economic benefit (Fig 5) . A conservative approach can exit lockdown with 1 day of work, build up to two days, and so on. Measures will be required during the work days to ensure that people do not excessively compensate for the lockdown periods by having so many more social connections that R is strongly increased. This may include sound epidemiological measures such as the continuation of banning large social events and clear communication campaigns by the health authorities to enhance adherence to hygiene and physical distancing. Shared work spaces can be disinfected to reduce future infection through surfaces. Extensive rapid testing and contact tracing should be developed and extended in parallel 15 .",

A key idea in this analysis is that the replication number is a function of economic variables, including consumption of \"social\" goods and market work (labor). The social good is one that involves many social interactions, such as going to a restaurant. Economic outcomes under lockdown policies are determined by the operation of at least two margins: (i) how flexible is each job in terms of working remotely; and (ii) whether production is intense in the social good (i.e., has high inputs of the social good) or in the regular consumption good. The authors give the example of waiters and shop assistants jobs as inflexible and high on social goods; in contrast, the production of a software engineer or an architect is highly flexible and not intense in the social good.

The mechanism is as follows: the initial effects of the epidemic and lockdown policy affect production and consumption; depending on how consumption and production of the social good are affected, \u03b2{t} is affected in turn; hence, epidemic dynamics are affected, and in turn influence production and consumption once more, and the process is iterated. The authors aim at modelling the emerging tradeoff between health and economic outcomes, given policy choices under this mechanism. They conjecture that there may be a region where both health and economic outcomes could be improved. The current proposal of a cyclic strategy aims at such improvement. Forecasts by the IMF, [iii] central banks and investment banks speak of declines in the whole of 2020, including a recovery phase, of 6%-12% of GDP.

Analyses of the economic consequences of the 1918 Spanish flu (Great Influenza Pandemic) found that the influenza led to 39 million deaths (which translate to 150 million deaths in 2020 terms), a drop in GDP of 6%, and a consumption decline of 8% in typical countries. These losses are comparable to those seen in the last global Great Recession of 2008-2009 20 . In fact, the expected annual cost of pandemic influenza falls in the same range as does that of climate change between 0.2% and 2% of global income. A pandemic that exceeds 720,000 deaths per year worldwide would cost $570 billion per year ($80 billion in lost income and $490 billion in mortality cost), 0.7% of global income21 .",
