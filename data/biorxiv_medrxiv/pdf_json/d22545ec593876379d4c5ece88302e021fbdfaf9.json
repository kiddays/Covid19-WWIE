Presenting few symptoms, but showing high viral load from the respiratory tract; 2. A two-step disease process, with worsening of symptoms around 10 days of symptom onset in spite of decreased viral load in respiratory samples. In our model we plot the disease progression as a function of infection, survivability, and inflammation ( Figure 2 ).

Laboratory studies may include an elevated D-Dimer and prothrombin time, as well as lymphopenia (see Figure 2 ).
