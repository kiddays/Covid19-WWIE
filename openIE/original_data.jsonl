{"text": "Thai medicinal plants may be useful for treating PRRSV infection in pigs . "}
{"text": "Therefore , we investigated the in vitro anti-PRRSV and antioxidant properties of seven Thai medicinal plants : Caesalpinia sappan Linn. , Garcinia mangostana Linn. , Houttuynia cordata , Perilla frutescens , Clinacanthus nutans , Phyllanthus emblica , and Tiliacora triandra . "}
{"text": "Results : Using antiviral screening , we observed that T. triandra extract strongly inhibited PRRSV infectivity in MARC-145 cells [ virus titer 3.5 median tissue culture infective dose ( TCID 50 ) /ml ( log10 ) ] at 24 h post-infection , whereas C. sappan extract strongly inhibited PRRSV replication [ virus titer 2.5 TCID 50 /ml ( log10 ) ] at 72 h post-infection . "}
{"text": "C. sappan extract had the highest total phenolic content [ 220.52 mM gallic acid equivalent/g ] and lowest half-maximal inhibitory concentration [ 1.17 mg/ml in 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl and 2.58 mg/ml in 2,2-azino-bis ( 3ethylbenzothiazo-line-6-sulfonic acid ) diammonium salt ] . "}

{"text": "It is proposed that virus is normally latent in many elderly brains but reactivates periodically ( as in the peripheral nervous system ) under certain conditions , for example stress , immunosuppression , and peripheral infection , causing cumulative damage and eventually development of AD .

{"text": "Diverse approaches have provided data that explicitly support , directly or indirectly , these concepts . "}
{"text": "Several have confirmed HSV1 DNA presence in human brains , and the HSV1-APOE-ε4 association in AD . "}
{"text": "Further , studies on HSV1-infected APOE-transgenic mice have shown that APOE-e4 animals display a greater potential for viral damage . "}
{"text": "Reactivated HSV1 can cause direct and inflammatory damage , probably involving increased formation of beta amyloid ( Aβ ) and of AD-like tau ( P-tau ) -changes found to occur in HSV1-infected cell cultures . "}
{"text": "Implicating HSV1 further in AD is the discovery that HSV1 DNA is specifically localized in amyloid plaques in AD . "}
{"text": "Other relevant , harmful effects of infection include the following : dynamic interactions between HSV1 and amyloid precursor protein ( APP ) , which would affect both viral and APP transport ; induction of toll-like receptors ( TLRs ) in HSV1-infected astrocyte cultures , which has been linked to the likely effects of reactivation of the virus in brain . "}
{"text": "Several epidemiological studies have shown , using serological data , an association between systemic infections and cognitive decline , with HSV1 particularly implicated . "}

{"text": "Reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) , a mediator of cell apoptosis , play a crucial role in the mitochondria apoptotic pathway . "}
{"text": "However , whether PPV infection induces ST cells apoptosis and ROS accumulation is still unclear . "}
{"text": "Methods : To determine the effects of PPV infection on the apoptosis , we detected morphological changes , DNA ladder , activities of caspases , and expression of PARP in PPV-infected ST cells . "}
{"text": "Moreover , aiming to investigate the effect of PPV infection on the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway and ROS accumulation , we detected the Δψm , apoptosis-related genes , and ROS . "}
{"text": "To investigate the role of ROS in the process of PPV-induced apoptosis , the ST cells were infected with PPV and treated with the ROS antioxidants . "}
{"text": "The ROS level was measured using Reactive Oxygen Species Assay Kit and the Δψm , expression level of Bcl-2 , translocation of Bax , and redistribution of mitochondria cytochrome c were tested . "}
{"text": "In this study , we demonstrated that PPV infection could induce apoptosis that was characterized by morphological changes , DNA fragmentation and activation of caspases . "}
{"text": "Moreover , PPV infection suppressed Bcl-2 expression , enhanced Bax expression and translocation to mitochondria , decreased the mitochondrial transmembrane potential , and triggered the release of cytochrome c , which caused the subsequent activation of caspase-9 and caspase-3 and initiation of apoptosis . "}
{"text": "However , during the process of PPV-induced apoptosis , the protein levels of Fas and FasL were not affected . "}
{"text": "Further studies showed that PPV infection caused ROS accumulation . "}
{"text": "Inhibition of ROS could reduce mitochondrial transmembrane potential and could significantly block ST cells apoptosis via suppressing Bax translocation , cytochrome c and caspase-3 activation . "}

{"text": "Background : As internet and social media use have skyrocketed , epidemiologists have begun to use online data such as Google query data and Twitter trends to track the activity levels of influenza and other infectious diseases . "}
{"text": "In China , Weibo is an extremely popular microblogging site that is equivalent to Twitter . "}
{"text": "Capitalizing on the wealth of public opinion data contained in posts on Weibo , this study used Weibo as a measure of the Chinese people 's reactions to two different outbreaks : the 2012 Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus ( MERS-CoV ) outbreak , and the 2013 outbreak of human infection of avian influenza A ( H7N9 ) in China .

{"text": "Background : Poisson regression modeling has been widely used to estimate influenza-associated disease burden , as it has the advantage of adjusting for multiple seasonal confounders . "}
{"text": "However , few studies have discussed how to judge the adequacy of confounding adjustment . "}
{"text": "This study aims to compare the performance of commonly adopted model selection criteria in terms of providing a reliable and valid estimate for the health impact of influenza . "}
{"text": "Methods : We assessed four model selection criteria : quasi Akaike information criterion ( QAIC ) , quasi Bayesian information criterion ( QBIC ) , partial autocorrelation functions of residuals ( PACF ) , and generalized cross-validation ( GCV ) , by separately applying them to select the Poisson model best fitted to the mortality datasets that were simulated under the different assumptions of seasonal confounding . "}
{"text": "The performance of these criteria was evaluated by the bias and root-mean-square error ( RMSE ) of estimates from the pre-determined coefficients of influenza proxy variable . "}
{"text": "These four criteria were subsequently applied to an empirical hospitalization dataset to confirm the findings of simulation study . "}
{"text": "Results : GCV consistently provided smaller biases and RMSEs for the influenza coefficient estimates than QAIC , QBIC and PACF , under the different simulation scenarios . "}
{"text": "Sensitivity analysis of different pre-determined influenza coefficients , study periods and lag weeks showed that GCV consistently outperformed the other criteria . "}

{"text": "Here , using mouse squamous cell carcinoma cells , we report a completely new function for the autophagy protein Ambra1 as the first described 'spatial rheostat ' controlling the Src/FAK pathway . "}
{"text": "Ambra1 regulates the targeting of active phospho-Src away from focal adhesions into autophagic structures that cancer cells use to survive adhesion stress . "}
{"text": "Ambra1 binds to both FAK and Src in cancer cells . "}
{"text": "When FAK is present , Ambra1 is recruited to focal adhesions , promoting FAK-regulated cancer cell direction-sensing and invasion . "}
{"text": "However , when Ambra1 can not bind to FAK , abnormally high levels of phospho-Src and phospho-FAK accumulate at focal adhesions , positively regulating adhesion and invasive migration . "}
{"text": "Spatial control of active Src requires the trafficking proteins Dynactin one and IFITM3 , which we identified as Ambra1 binding partners by interaction proteomics . "}
{"text": "We conclude that Ambra1 is a core component of an intracellular trafficking network linked to tight spatial control of active Src and FAK levels , and so crucially regulates their cancer-associated biological outputs . "}
{"text": "We have developed a high-resolution genomic mapping technique that combines transposon-mediated insertional mutagenesis with either capillary electrophoresis or massively parallel sequencing to identify functionally important regions of the Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus ( VEEV ) genome . "}
{"text": "We initially used a capillary electrophoresis method to gain insight into the role of the VEEV nonstructural protein 3 ( nsP3 ) in viral replication . "}
{"text": "We identified several regions in nsP3 that are intolerant to small ( 15 bp ) insertions , and thus are presumably functionally important . "}
{"text": "We also identified nine separate regions in nsP3 that will tolerate small insertions at low temperatures ( 30uC ) , but not at higher temperatures ( 37uC , and 40uC ) . "}
{"text": "Because we found this method to be extremely effective at identifying temperature sensitive ( ts ) mutations , but limited by capillary electrophoresis capacity , we replaced the capillary electrophoresis with massively parallel sequencing and used the improved method to generate a functional map of the entire VEEV genome .

{"text": "In this study , we performed modeling studies to obtain its 3D structure and NDM-1/antibiotics complex . "}
{"text": "It revealed that the hydrolytic mechanisms are highly conserved . "}
{"text": "In addition , the detailed analysis indicates that the more flexible and hydrophobic loop1 , together with the evolution of more positive-charged loop2 leads to NDM-1 positive strain more potent and extensive in antibiotics resistance compared with other MBLs . "}
{"text": "Furthermore , through biological experiments , we revealed the molecular basis for antibiotics catalysis of NDM-1 on the enzymatic level . "}

{"text": "We next observed that similar doses of apilimod block EBOV-glycoprotein-virus like particle ( VLP ) entry and transcription-replication competent VLP infection , suggesting that the primary mode of action of apilimod is as an entry inhibitor , preventing release of the viral genome into the cytoplasm to initiate replication . "}
{"text": "After providing evidence that the anti-EBOV action of apilimod is via PIKfyve , we showed that it blocks trafficking of EBOV VLPs to endolysosomes containing Niemann-Pick C1 ( NPC1 ) , the intracellular receptor for EBOV . "}

"}
{"text": "Conclusions : Semi-quantitative measures of microbial concentration did not reliably differentiate between illness and asymptomatic colonization , suggesting that clinical symptoms may not always be directly related to microbial load for common respiratory infections . "}
{"text": "Background : In many studies , some information might not be available for the whole cohort , some covariates , or even the outcome , might be ascertained in selected subsamples . "}
{"text": "These studies are part of a broad category termed two-phase studies . "}
{"text": "Common examples include the nested case-control and the case-cohort designs . "}
{"text": "For two-phase studies , appropriate weighted survival estimates have been derived ; however , no estimator of cumulative incidence accounting for competing events has been proposed . "}
{"text": "This is relevant in the presence of multiple types of events , where estimation of event type specific quantities are needed for evaluating outcome . "}
{"text": "Methods : We develop a non parametric estimator of the cumulative incidence function of events accounting for possible competing events . "}
{"text": "It handles a general sampling design by weights derived from the sampling probabilities . "}
{"text": "The variance is derived from the influence function of the subdistribution hazard . "}
{"text": "Results : The proposed method shows good performance in simulations . "}
{"text": "It is applied to estimate the crude incidence of relapse in childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia in groups defined by a genotype not available for everyone in a cohort of nearly 2000 patients , where death due to toxicity acted as a competing event . "}
{"text": "In a second example the aim was to estimate engagement in care of a cohort of HIV patients in resource limited setting , where for some patients the outcome itself was missing due to lost to follow-up . "}
{"text": "A sampling based approach was used to identify outcome in a subsample of lost patients and to obtain a valid estimate of connection to care . "}

{"text": "Background : The outcome of a viral infection is regulated by complex interactions of viral and host factors . "}
{"text": "SARS coronavirus ( SARS-CoV ) engages and regulates several innate immune response pathways during infection . "}
{"text": "We have previously shown that the SARS-CoV Papain-like Protease ( PLpro ) inhibits type I interferon ( IFN ) by inhibiting IRF3 phosphorylation thereby blocking downstream Interferon induction . "}
{"text": "This finding prompted us to identify other potential mechanisms of inhibition of PLpro on IFN induction . "}
{"text": "Methods : We have used plasmids expressing PLpro and IRF3 including an IRF3 mutant that is constitutively active , called IRF3 ( 5D ) . "}
{"text": "In these experiments we utilize transfections , chromatin immunoprecipitation , Electro-mobility Shift Assays ( EMSA ) and protein localization to identify where IRF3 and IRF3 ( 5D ) are inhibited by PLpro . "}
{"text": "Results : Here we show that PLpro also inhibits IRF3 activation at a step after phosphorylation and that this inhibition is dependent on the de-ubiquitination ( DUB ) activity of PLpro . "}
{"text": "We found that PLpro is able to block the type I IFN induction of a constitutively active IRF3 , but does not inhibit IRF3 dimerization , nuclear localization or DNA binding . "}
{"text": "However , inhibition of PLpro 's DUB activity by mutagenesis blocked the IRF3 inhibition activity of PLpro , suggesting a role for IRF3 ubiquitination in induction of a type I IFN innate immune response . "}
{"text": "Conclusion : These results demonstrate an additional mechanism that PLpro is able to inhibit IRF3 signaling . "}
{"text": "These data suggest novel innate immune antagonism activities of PLpro that may contribute to SARS-CoV pathogenesis . "}
{"text": "Background : La Crosse virus ( LACV ) , family Bunyaviridae , was first identified as a human pathogen in 1960 after its isolation from a 4 year-old girl with fatal encephalitis in La Crosse , Wisconsin . "}
{"text": "As an initial step in the establishment of useful animal models to support vaccine development , we examined LACV infectivity , pathogenesis , and immunogenicity in both weanling mice and rhesus monkeys . "}
{"text": "Following intraperitoneal inoculation of mice , LACV replicated in various organs before reaching the CNS where it replicates to high titer causing death from neurological disease . "}
{"text": "The peripheral site where LACV replicates to highest titer is the nasal turbinates , and , presumably , LACV can enter the CNS via the olfactory neurons from nasal olfactory epithelium . "}
{"text": "The mouse infectious dose 50 and lethal dose 50 was similar for LACV administered either intranasally or intraperitoneally . "}
{"text": "LACV was highly infectious for rhesus monkeys and infected 100 % of the animals at 10 PFU . "}
{"text": "However , the infection was asymptomatic , and the monkeys developed a strong neutralizing antibody response . "}
{"text": "In mice , LACV likely gains access to the CNS via the blood stream or via olfactory neurons . "}
{"text": "The ability to efficiently infect mice intranasally raises the possibility that LACV might use this route to infect its natural hosts . "}
{"text": "Rhesus monkeys are susceptible to LACV infection and develop strong neutralizing antibody responses after inoculation with as little as 10 PFU . "}

{"text": "Since that in the seasons 2010-2011 and 2011-2012 the circulation of FLUB was decreasing we evaluated the clinical presentation , demographic characteristics , admitting department , and length of stay in children who contracted influenza admitted to Bambino Gesù Children 's Hospital , during the 2012-2013 influenza season , with the aim to establish if the recover of FLUB was associated to a clinical worsening , in comparison with those due to FLUA . "}
{"text": "Methods : A total of 133 respiratory specimens , collected from patients with symptoms of respiratory tract infections , positive for the Influenza A and B viruses ( FLUA and B ) were subtyped . "}
{"text": "Comparisons between the FLUA and FLUB groups were performed with the one-way ANOVA for continuous parametric variables , the Mann-Whitney test for non-parametric variables , or the Chi-Square test or Fisher 's exact test ( if cells < 5 ) for categorical variables . "}
{"text": "Results : 87.09 % of the FLUA isolates were the H1N1 subtype and 12.90 % were H3N2 . "}
{"text": "Among the FLUB isolates , 91.54 % were the B/Yamagata/16/88 lineage and 8.45 % were the B/Victoria/02/87 lineage . "}
{"text": "The largest number of FLUA/H1N1 cases was observed in children less than 1 years old , while the B/Yamagata/16/88 lineage was most prevalent in children 3-6 years old . "}
{"text": "Fever was a common symptom for both FLUA and B affected patients . "}
{"text": "The median length of stay in the hospital was 5 days for FLUA and 3 days for FLUB . "}
{"text": "Conclusions : The clinical features correlated to different Influenza viruses , and relevant subtypes , were evaluated concluding that the increasing of FLUB in the season 2012-2013 was without any dramatic change in clinical manifestation . "}
{"text": "Our findings suggest , finally , that a stronger commitment to managing patients affected by FLUA is required , as the disease is more severe than FLUB . "}

{"text": "Here we present our modular concerted protocol for sample processing for diagnostic metagenomics analysis of human , animal , and food samples . "}
{"text": "The workflow does not rely on dedicated amplification steps at any stage in the process and , in contrast to published methods , libraries prepared accordingly will yield only minute amounts of unclassifiable reads . "}
{"text": "We confirmed the performance of the approach using a spectrum of pathogen/ matrix-combinations showing it has the potential to become a commonly usable analytical framework . "}
{"text": "Diagnostic metagenomics with high-throughput sequencing ( HTS ) techniques continuously gains importance for broad and swift identification of pathogens in human , animal , and food samples 1 . "}
{"text": "While for known pathogens , highly sensitive and specific diagnostic methods like real-time quantitative PCR ( qPCR ) are in routine use and deliver reliable results , the identification of unrecognized pathogens , meaning unexpected or newly emerging pathogens or pathogens that are only distantly related with known ones , can be very difficult . "}
{"text": "In this respect , metagenomics using HTS are much more promising than routine diagnostics . "}
{"text": "Unrecognized pathogens , especially newly emerging zoonoses , may cause serious infectious diseases , and a delay of medical treatment or development of vaccines might have fatal consequences for the affected patients and animal stocks . "}
{"text": "Such delays can be caused by performing numerous laborious screening tests until the potential pathogen is found instead of a single comprehensive screening test . "}
{"text": "Prominent cases of emerging infectious diseases caused by novel or varying viruses for instance are the discovery of the Middle East respiratory syndrome ( MERS ) coronavirus in 2012 2 , the tremendous Ebola outbreak in 2014 3 , the report on a novel zoonotic bornavirus 4 , or the detection of the new Schmallenberg virus 5 affecting domestic and wild ruminants . "}
{"text": "However , infectious diseases with clinical signs like high fever , diarrhoea , or encephalitis − often life-threatening − can be caused by very different infectious agents 6,7 , not only viruses . "}
{"text": "In such puzzling cases , a generic approach that works likewise successful and efficient for all pathogen groups , as sketched in Fig . "}

{"text": "In addition to the overall workflow outlined in Fig . "}
{"text": "1 , after metagenomic analysis , it is desirable to confirm the initial sequencing-based suspicion by other methods and in the ideal case by fulfilling the Henle-Loeffler-Koch postulates 13 as for example done in case of the Schmallenberg virus 5 . "}
{"text": "Metagenomics for generic pathogen detection , so-called diagnostic metagenomics , in its pure form is a broad and undirected approach to find gene sequences or sequence fragments of infectious agents within sequence data sets of the whole community of a sample generated by high-throughput sequencing . "}
{"text": "A crucial point when handling diagnostic sequencing approaches is to explicitly distinguish between i ) high-throughput well-standardisable routine diagnostics for expected known pathogens and ii ) diagnostic metagenomics for all including unrecognized pathogens . "}
{"text": "The first approach is easier to design based on the spectrum of known sequences , testing with specific oligonucleotide primers for pathogens of known identity 14,15 , known tropism , and maybe also of a known proportion within a sample . "}
{"text": "The latter one − used for unrecognized pathogens like in the case of Schmallenberg virus 5 − should be a generic approach that can ideally be applied to all samples and pathogens . "}
{"text": "This approach can indeed be developed and tested using samples of known origin and pathogen content . "}

{"text": "Background : We sought to assess reporting in China 's Pneumonia of Unknown Etiology ( PUE ) passive surveillance system for emerging respiratory infections and to identify ways to improve the PUE surveillance system 's detection of respiratory infections of public health significance . "}
{"text": "Methods : From February 29-May 29 , 2016 , we actively identified and enrolled patients in two hospitals with acute respiratory infections ( ARI ) that met all PUE case criteria . "}
{"text": "We reviewed medical records for documented exposure history associated with respiratory infectious diseases , collected throat samples that were tested for seasonal and avian influenza , and interviewed clinicians regarding reasons for reporting or not reporting PUE cases . "}
{"text": "We described and analyzed the proportion of PUE cases reported and clinician awareness of and practices related to the PUE system . "}
{"text": "Results : Of 2619 ARI admissions in two hospitals , 335 ( 13 % ) met the PUE case definition ; none were reported . "}
{"text": "Of 311 specimens tested , 18 ( 6 % ) were seasonal influenza virus-positive ; none were avian influenza-positive . "}
{"text": "< 10 % PUE case medical records documented whether or not there were exposures to animals or others with respiratory illness . "}
{"text": "Most commonly cited reasons for not reporting cases were no awareness of the PUE system ( 76 % ) and not understanding the case definition ( 53 % ) . "}
{"text": "Conclusions : Most clinicians have limited awareness of and are not reporting to the PUE system . "}
{"text": "Exposures related to respiratory infections are rarely documented in medical records . "}
{"text": "Increasing clinicians ' awareness of the PUE system and including relevant exposure items in standard medical records may increase reporting . "}
{"text": "Exosomes are extracellular vesicles released upon fusion of multivesicular bodies ( MVBs ) with the cellular plasma membrane . "}
{"text": "They originate as intraluminal vesicles ( ILVs ) during the process of MVB formation . "}
{"text": "Exosomes were shown to contain selectively sorted functional proteins , lipids , and RNAs , mediating cell-to-cell communications and hence playing a role in the physiology of the healthy and diseased organism . "}
{"text": "Challenges in the field include the identification of mechanisms sustaining packaging of membrane-bound and soluble material to these vesicles and the understanding of the underlying processes directing MVBs for degradation or fusion with the plasma membrane . "}
{"text": "The investigation into the formation and roles of exosomes in viral infection is in its early years . "}
{"text": "Although still controversial , exosomes can , in principle , incorporate any functional factor , provided they have an appropriate sorting signal , and thus are prone to viral exploitation . "}
{"text": "This review initially focuses on the composition and biogenesis of exosomes . "}
{"text": "It then explores the regulatory mechanisms underlying their biogenesis . "}
{"text": "We discuss the current knowledge of how these changes affect exosomal release . "}
{"text": "We then summarize how different viruses exploit specific proteins of endocytic sub-compartments and speculate that it could interfere with exosome function , although no direct link between viral usage of the endocytic system and exosome release has yet been reported . "}
{"text": "Many recent reports have ascribed functions to exosomes released from cells infected with a variety of animal viruses , including viral spread , host immunity , and manipulation of the microenvironment , which are discussed . "}
{"text": "Given the ever-growing roles and importance of exosomes in viral infections , understanding what regulates their composition and levels , and defining their functions will ultimately provide additional insights into the virulence and persistence of infections . "}

"}
{"text": "Unfortunately , pathogens such as influenza virus and Streptococcus pneumoniae require hosts for their replication and dissemination , and prey on the respiratory tract as an ideal environment causing severe damage to the host during their invasion . "}

{"text": "MS2 phage-like particles ( MS2 PLP ) are artificially constructed pseudo-viral particles derived from bacteriophage MS2 . "}
{"text": "Such particles are able to mimic ssRNA viruses and , thus , may serve as the process control for molecular detection and quantification of such agents in several kinds of matrices , vaccines and vaccine candidates , drug delivery systems , and systems for the display of immunologically active peptides or nanomachines . "}
{"text": "Currently , there are several different in vivo plasmid-driven packaging systems for production of MS2 PLP . "}
{"text": "In order to combine all the advantages of the available systems and to upgrade and simplify the production and purification of MS2 PLP , a one-plasmid double-expression His-tag system was designed . "}
{"text": "The described system utilizes a unique fusion insertional mutation enabling purification of particles using His-tag affinity . "}
{"text": "Using this new production system , highly pure MS2 PLP can be quickly produced and purified by a fast performance liquid chromatography ( FPLC ) approach . "}
{"text": "The system can be easily adapted to produce other MS2 PLP with different properties . "}
{"text": "MS2 phage-like particles ( MS2 PLP ) are artificial pseudo-viral particles whose production is based on knowledge of the familiar bacteriophage MS2 ( +ssRNA , Leviviridae ) 1 and the ability of its coat protein dimers to pack specific single-stranded RNA ( ssRNA ) molecules 2-4 . "}
{"text": "The packaging is driven by dimerization of coat proteins followed by a specific interaction of dimers with a stem-loop structure ( called the `` pac '' site ) in ssRNA resulting in spontaneous formation of MS2 PLP . "}
{"text": "These particles are small in size ( about 27 nm ) , non-enveloped , non-infectious , non-replicative , stable pseudo-viral particles with the ability to protect encapsidated ssRNA molecules against the effects of ubiquitous nucleases . "}
{"text": "Due to these properties and their morphological and physicochemical characteristics , MS2 PLP carrying specific ssRNA molecules can serve as suitable process control virus ( PCV ) for the detection and quantification of ssRNA viruses within a wide range of samples ; for example , human norovirus ( NoV ) , human enterovirus ( EV ) , hepatitis A virus ( HAV ) , hepatitis E virus ( HEV ) , hepatitis C virus ( HCV ) , and human immunodeficiency virus type 1 ( HIV-1 ) 2,5-8 . "}
{"text": "Perspectives on the practical use of MS2 PLP as RNA vaccines and vaccine candidates , drug delivery systems , and systems for the display of immunologically active peptides or nanomachines are discussed in a recent review 9 . "}
{"text": "Since the first study at the beginning of the 1990s in which non-bacteriophage RNA was encapsulated by MS2 coat protein dimers , many different methods for the production of MS2 PLP have been developed 4 . "}
{"text": "Currently , the production of MS2 PLP is based on various in vivo plasmid-driven packaging systems , which exploit the spontaneous assembly of MS2 coat protein dimers in the presence of the pac site inside Escherichia coli ( E. coli ) 10 . "}
{"text": "However , while each of these systems have their advantages , they are also characterized by various drawbacks , e.g. , limited capacity for packaging of control ssRNA , lower efficiency of packaging , complicated system construction , or complicated and time-consuming purification of produced MS2 PLP . "}
{"text": "The newest and most advanced plasmid-driven packaging system , the so-called one-plasmid double-expression packaging system , allows construction of MS2 PLP with high efficiency and packaging specificity , and allows a maximum length of encapsidated ssRNA of up to 3,600 nucleotides ( nt ) 11 . "}
{"text": "However , this system still does not address a major drawback of current MS2 PLP preparations : the purification procedure . "}
{"text": "Therefore , produced MS2 PLP must be purified in a time-consuming and laborious ultracentrifugation step , which does not isolate MS2 PLP in the required purity 4 , 8 , 10 , 11 , 13 . "}
{"text": "The problem of purification can be solved by the introduction of an affinity tag ( e.g. , polyhistidine-tag ; His-tag ) to the structure of MS2 PLP allowing their purification using the Co 2+ affinity chromatography method 13,14 . "}
{"text": "This approach enables easy and fast purification of huge amounts of pure MS2 PLP . "}
{"text": "As the one-plasmid double-expression packaging system had not yet been developed at that time , Cheng et al . "}
{"text": "used a so-called one-plasmid expression system for production of MS2 PLP . "}
{"text": "The system has limited capacity for packaging of control sequences ( up to 2,000 nt ) , and the particles contain undesirable sequences from bacteriophage MS2 10,13 . "}
{"text": "Based on this knowledge , none of the previously used plasmid-driven systems for production of MS2 PLP is ideal . "}
{"text": "The novelty of the present study lies not only in combination of all the experience acquired so far with the different methods of MS2 PLP construction for developing a new plasmid-driven construction system , which integrates all the advantages and benefits of the previously described systems . "}
{"text": "This is also the first report about the construction of single-chain version of the coat protein dimer containing the His-tag capable to successfully form intact His-tagged MS2 PLP that can be purified in less than one hour by FPLC . "}

{"text": "Background : Growing number of confirmed and deaths cases from the coronavirus worldwide , particularly in Italy , Iran and South Korea , has resulted concerns about the future of these countries and their deterioration . "}
{"text": "Also the European region is likely to face more casualties due to the delay in the virus reaching most of its regions and , of course , as the trend continues . "}
{"text": "Methods : We conducted a simulation in both current and ideal situation for the next month to predict the death rate and examine the reason for the difference in Italy , Iran and South Korea individually . "}
{"text": "If we assume the cultural and political factors and age pyramids distribution are similar across regions , the differences are mainly due either to the heavier health-care burden owing to the larger population or to the medical facilities diversities . "}
{"text": "Results : Our results for Italy showed higher death number , but the rate would be more for Iran . "}
{"text": "South Korea is also expected to have a smaller increase in the number of confirmed cases and deaths compared to Iran and Italy by the next month . "}
{"text": "Conclusion : Given the prevailing conditions around the world and the increasing number of casualties , it is essential that all countries , especially those with fewer days of involvement , shall do their best to avoid major losses and damages . "}
{"text": "There are four human coronaviruses ( HCoVs ) , distributed worldwide , that are associated with a range of respiratory symptoms . "}

{"text": "Our work aims to develop a sensitive method ( mCoV-MS ) which can not only identify known HCoVs accurately , but also have the ability to provide clues for the emerging HCoVs . "}
{"text": "The method was performed using a MassARRAY matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry ( MALDI-TOF MS ) system . "}
{"text": "We developed a 17-plex analysis to detect six HCoVs in Panel A and another 17-plex analysis to detect Alphacoronavirus and Betacoronavirus in Panel B . "}
{"text": "All tested primers and probes for the mCoV-MS method were effective , with no cross-reactivity observed with other common respiratory viruses . "}
{"text": "To confirm the usefulness of the mCoV-MS method we screened 384 pharyngeal and/or anal swab samples collected from bats/rodents , and 131 nasal and throat swabs from human patients . "}
{"text": "The results showed good concordance with the results of metagenomic analysis or PCR-sequencing . "}
{"text": "The validation test showed mCoV-MS method can detect potentially pathogenic CoVs in Alphacoronavirus and Betacoronavirus and provide convincingly phylogenetic evidences about unknown CoVs . "}

{"text": "In the meantime , B. subtilis-RC remarkably increased the number of intraepithelial lymphocytes ( IELs ) . "}
{"text": "We also observed that oral administration of B. subtilis-RC significantly increased CD3 + T lymphocytes ' numbers and up-regulated the ratio of CD4 + /CD8 + T cells . "}
{"text": "Furthermore , high titers of specific serum immunoglobulin G ( IgG ) revealed satisfactory systemic immune response against PEDV infection . "}
{"text": "In summary , our study demonstrated that oral administration of B. subtilis-RC could trigger a high level of local and systemic immune responses and would be a promising candidate vaccine against PEDV infection in piglets . "}

{"text": "Background : The advancements in DNA sequencing technologies have allowed researchers to progress from the analyses of a single organism towards the deep sequencing of a sample of organisms . "}
{"text": "With sufficient sequencing depth , it is now possible to detect subtle variations between members of the same species , or between mixed species with shared biomarkers , such as the 16S rRNA gene . "}
{"text": "However , traditional sequencing analyses of samples from largely homogeneous populations are often still based on multiple sequence alignments ( MSA ) , where each sequence is placed along a separate row and similarities between aligned bases can be followed down each column . "}
{"text": "While this visual format is intuitive for a small set of aligned sequences , the representation quickly becomes cumbersome as sequencing depths cover loci hundreds or thousands of reads deep . "}
{"text": "We have developed ANDES , a software library and a suite of applications , written in Perl and R , for the statistical ANalyses of DEep Sequencing . "}

{"text": "Tools include the root mean square deviation ( RMSD ) plot , which allows for the visual comparison of multiple samples on a position-by-position basis , and the computation of base conversion frequencies ( transition/transversion rates ) , variation ( Shannon entropy ) , inter-sample clustering and visualization ( dendrogram and multidimensional scaling ( MDS ) plot ) , threshold-driven consensus sequence generation and polymorphism detection , and the estimation of empirically determined sequencing quality values . "}
{"text": "As new sequencing technologies evolve , deep sequencing will become increasingly cost-efficient and the inter and intra-sample comparisons of largely homogeneous sequences will become more common . "}

{"text": "Results : A timely application of antiviral drugs combined with a quick implementation of contact reduction measures is required to substantially protract the peak of the epidemic and reduce its height . "}
{"text": "Delays in the initiation of antiviral treatment ( e.g . "}

{"text": "Recently , the role of protease-activated receptors ( PAR ) in inflammation , coagulation and infection processes has been of growing interest . "}
{"text": "Herein , the effects of a PAR1 agonist and a PAR1 antagonist on hMPV infection were investigated in BALB/c mice . "}
{"text": "Intranasal administration of the PAR1 agonist resulted in increased weight loss and mortality of infected mice . "}
{"text": "Conversely , the PAR1 antagonist was beneficial to hMPV infection by decreasing weight loss and clinical signs and by significantly reducing pulmonary inflammation , pro-inflammatory cytokine levels ( including IL-6 , KC and MCP-1 ) and recruitment of immune cells to the lungs . "}
{"text": "In addition , a significant reduction in pulmonary viral titers was also observed in the lungs of PAR1 antagonist-treated mice . "}
{"text": "Despite no apparent direct effect on virus replication during in vitro experiments , an important role for PAR1 in the regulation of furin expression in the lungs was shown for the first time . "}
{"text": "Further experiments indicated that the hMPV fusion protein can be cleaved by furin thus suggesting that PAR1 could have an effect on viral infectivity in addition to its immunomodulatory properties . "}

{"text": "In critically ill patients higher incidence and worse prognosis of severe sepsis/septic shock appear to be associated with low-producers haplotypes . "}
{"text": "However an excess of MBL activation might be also harmful due to the possibility of an unbalanced proinflammatory response and an additional host injury . "}

{"text": "The surface of the groove , covered with numerous conserved residues between the head and body domains of influenza A NP , plays a crucial role in RNA binding . "}

{"text": "By targeting Y148 , we identified an influenza virus NP inhibitor , H7 [ ( E , E ) -1,7-bis ( 4-hydroxy-3-me thoxyphenyl ) -1,6-heptadiene-3,5-dione ] , which reduced the NP 's RNA-binding affinity and hindered viral replication . "}
{"text": "Finally , we present a structural model of the influenza NP in complex with RNA , which clearly illustrates the critical role of Y148 . "}
{"text": "Influenza infection and pneumonia are known to cause much of their mortality by inducing acute respiratory distress syndrome ( ARDS ) , which is the most severe form of acute lung injury ( ALI ) . "}
{"text": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ( ACE2 ) , which is a negative regulator of angiotensin II in the renin-angiotensin system , has been reported to have a crucial role in ALI . "}
{"text": "Downregulation of ACE2 is always associated with the ALI or ARDS induced by avian influenza virus , severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus , respiratory syncytial virus and sepsis . "}
{"text": "However , the molecular mechanism of the decreased expression of ACE2 in ALI is unclear . "}
{"text": "Here we show that avian influenza virus H5N1 induced the upregulation of miR-200c-3p , which was then demonstrated to target the 3′-untranslated region of ACE2 . "}
{"text": "Then , we found that nonstructural protein 1 and viral RNA of H5N1 contributed to the induction of miR-200c-3p during viral infection . "}
{"text": "Additionally , the synthetic analog of viral double-stranded RNA ( poly ( I : C ) ) , bacterial lipopolysaccharide and lipoteichoic acid can all markedly increase the expression of miR-200c-3p in a nuclear factor-κB-dependent manner . "}
{"text": "Furthermore , markedly elevated plasma levels of miR-200c-3p were observed in severe pneumonia patients . "}
{"text": "The inhibition of miR-200c-3p ameliorated the ALI induced by H5N1 virus infection in vivo , indicating a potential therapeutic target . "}
{"text": "Therefore , we identify a shared mechanism of viral and bacterial lung infection-induced ALI/ARDS via nuclear factor-κB-dependent upregulation of miR-200c-3p to reduce ACE2 levels , which leads increased angiotensin II levels and subsequently causes lung injury . "}
{"text": "Point-of-care tests are needed for the screening of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma ( HNSCC ) and other malignancies . "}
{"text": "Luciferase immunoprecipitation systems ( LIPS ) , employing light-emitting proteins , were used to examine serum antibodies against several cancer-associated targets in blood donor controls and subjects with colon cancer ( CC ) and HNSCC . "}
{"text": "The assessment of antibodies against the wild type p53 tumor antigen showed that approximately 25 % of the CC and 20 % of the HNSCC patients were seropositive . "}
{"text": "In addition , humoral responses against two p53 mutants , p53-R175H and p53-R273H , generally tracked the antibody responses seen against wild type p53 . "}
{"text": "Analysis of antibodies against highly specific biomarkers of HPV-16-associated malignancy , E2 , E6 , and E7 oncoproteins , revealed no seropositivity in blood donors and CC patients . "}
{"text": "However , 45 % ( 9/20 ) of the HNSCC patients showed E6 seropositivity , which overlapped all the detectable E2 ( 40 % ; 8/20 ) and E7 seropositive subjects ( 35 % ; 7/20 ) . "}
{"text": "Using neodymium magnets , ultrarapid LIPSTICKS testing of HPV-16 E6 antibodies in < 60 s per HNSCC sample demonstrated almost the same diagnostic performance ( 40 % sensitivity and 100 % specificity ) as LIPS testing in 2.5 h. While additional improvements and standardization are needed , these results highlight the possibility of using these approaches for the diagnosis of HPV-16-associated HNSCC . "}
{"text": "The transmission potential of a novel infection depends on both the inherent transmissibility of a pathogen , and the level of susceptibility in the host population . "}
{"text": "However , distinguishing between these pathogen-and population-specific properties typically requires detailed serological studies , which are rarely available in the early stages of an outbreak . "}
{"text": "Using a simple transmission model that incorporates age-stratified social mixing patterns , we present a novel method for characterizing the transmission potential of subcritical infections , which have effective reproduction number R < 1 , from readily available data on the size of outbreaks . "}
{"text": "We show that the model can identify the extent to which outbreaks are driven by inherent pathogen transmissibility and pre-existing population immunity , and can generate unbiased estimates of the effective reproduction number . "}
{"text": "Applying the method to real-life infections , we obtained accurate estimates for the degree of age-specific immunity against monkeypox , influenza A ( H5N1 ) and A ( H7N9 ) , and refined existing estimates of the reproduction number . "}
{"text": "Our results also suggest minimal pre-existing immunity to MERS-CoV in humans . "}
{"text": "The approach we describe can therefore provide crucial information about novel infections before serological surveys and other detailed analyses are available . "}
{"text": "The methods would also be applicable to data stratified by factors such as profession or location , which would make it possible to measure the transmission potential of emerging infections in a wide range of settings . "}
{"text": "The transmission potential of a new infection depends on both the transmissibility of the pathogen and the level of immunity in the host population . "}
{"text": "However , it can be difficult to measure these properties if there are limited experimental studies of population immunity . "}
{"text": "By incorporating social contact patterns into a mathematical model of disease transmission , we show that it is possible to estimate both pathogen transmissibility and pre-existing immunity from available data on the size of outbreaks . "}
{"text": "When an infection does not transmit efficiently between humans , estimates often have to be made using case data from a limited number of small outbreaks . "}

{"text": "Background : It had been more than 5 years since the first case of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus infection ( MERS-CoV ) was recorded , but no specific treatment has been investigated in randomized clinical trials . "}
{"text": "Results from in vitro and animal studies suggest that a combination of lopinavir/ritonavir and interferon-β1b ( IFN-β1b ) may be effective against MERS-CoV . "}
{"text": "The aim of this study is to investigate the efficacy of treatment with a combination of lopinavir/ritonavir and recombinant IFN-β1b provided with standard supportive care , compared to treatment with placebo provided with standard supportive care in patients with laboratory-confirmed MERS requiring hospital admission .

{"text": "Recently , several plant-derived carbohydrate-binding proteins ( lectins ) have emerged as a new class of antiviral biologics by taking advantage of a unique glycosylation pattern only found on the surface of viruses . "}
{"text": "In particular , a red algae-derived griffithsin ( GRFT ) protein has demonstrated superior in vitro and in vivo antiviral activity with minimum host toxicity against a variety of clinically relevant , enveloped viruses . "}
{"text": "This review examines the structural characteristics of GRFT , focusing on its carbohydrate-binding capability . "}

{"text": "Finally , results from two ongoing clinical studies examining GRFT 's effects on viruses are presented . "}
{"text": "Background : Porcine β-defensin 2 ( PBD-2 ) , produced by host cells , is an antimicrobial cysteine-rich cationic peptide with multi-functions . "}
{"text": "Previous studies have demonstrated that PBD-2 can kill various bacteria , regulate host immune responses and promote growth of piglets . "}
{"text": "However , the antiviral role of PBD-2 is rarely investigated . "}
{"text": "This study aimed to reveal the antiviral ability of PBD-2 against pseudorabies virus ( PRV ) , the causative pathogen of Aujeszky 's disease , in PK-15 cells and in a PBD-2 expressing transgenic ( TG ) mouse model . "}
{"text": "Methods : In this study , the cytotoxicity of PBD-2 on PK-15 cells was measured by CCK-8 assay . "}
{"text": "TG mice and wild-type ( WT ) mice were intraperitoneally injected with PRV and the survival rate was recorded for 10 days . "}
{"text": "Meanwhile , tissue lesions in brain , spleen and liver of infected mice were observed and the viral loads of PRV in brain , liver and lung were analyzed by RT-qPCR . "}
{"text": "Results : PBD-2 at a maximum concentration of 80 μg/mL displayed no significant cytotoxicity on PK-15 cells . "}
{"text": "A threshold concentration of PBD-2 at 40 μg/mL was required to inhibit PRV proliferation in PK-15 cells . "}
{"text": "The survival rate in PBD-2 TG mice was 50 % higher than that of WT mice . "}
{"text": "In addition , TG mice showed alleviated tissue lesions in brain , spleen and liver compared with their WT littermates after PRV challenge , while viral loads of PRV in brain , liver and lung of TG mice were significantly lower than that of WT mice . "}
{"text": "Conclusions : PBD-2 could inhibit PRV proliferation in PK-15 cells and protect mice from PRV infection , which confirmed the antiviral ability of PBD-2 both in vitro and in vivo . "}
{"text": "The application of PBD-2 in developing anti-viral drugs or disease-resistant animals can be further investigated . "}
{"text": "Background : Fuelled by the advent and subsequent development of next generation sequencing technologies , metagenomics became a powerful tool for the analysis of microbial communities both scientifically and diagnostically . "}
