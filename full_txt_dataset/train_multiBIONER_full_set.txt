The
seasonal
outbreaks
of
influenza
infection
cause
globally
respiratory
illness
,
or
even
death
in
all
age
groups
.

Given
early-warning
signals
preceding
the
influenza
outbreak
,
timely
intervention
such
as
vaccination
and
isolation
management
effectively
decrease
the
morbidity
.

However
,
it
is
usually
a
difficult
task
to
achieve
the
real-time
prediction
of
influenza
outbreak
due
to
its
complexity
intertwining
both
biological
systems
and
social
systems
.

By
exploring
rich
dynamical
and
high-dimensional
information
,
our
dynamic
network
marker/biomarker
(
DNM/DNB
)
method
opens
a
new
way
to
identify
the
tipping
point
prior
to
the
catastrophic
transition
into
an
influenza
pandemics
.

In
order
to
detect
the
early-warning
signals
before
the
influenza
outbreak
by
applying
DNM
method
,
the
historical
information
of
clinic

caused
by
influenza
infection
between
years
2009
and
2016
were
extracted
and
assembled
from
public
records
of
Tokyo
and

,
Japan
.

The
early-warning
signal
,
with
an
average
of
4week
window

to
each
seasonal

Moreover
,
the

We
investigated
the
spatiotemporal
dynamics
of
HSV
genome
transport
during
the
initiation
of
infection
using
viruses
containing
bioorthogonal
traceable
precursors
incorporated
into
their
genomes
(
HSV
EdC
)
.

In
vitro
assays
revealed
a
structural
alteration
in
the
capsid
induced
upon
HSV
EdC
binding
to
solid
supports
that
allowed
coupling
to
external
capture
agents
and
demonstrated
that
the
vast
majority
of
individual
virions
contained
bioorthogonally-tagged
genomes
.

Using
HSV
EdC
in
vivo
we
reveal
novel
aspects
of
the
kinetics
,
localisation
,
mechanistic
entry
requirements
and
morphological
transitions
of
infecting
genomes
.

Uncoating
and
nuclear
import
was
observed
within
30
min
,
with
genomes
in
a
defined
compaction
state
(
ca
.

3-fold
volume
increase
from
capsids
)
.

Free
cytosolic
uncoated
genomes
were
infrequent
(
7-10
%
of
the
total
uncoated
genomes
)
,
likely
a
consequence
of
subpopulations
of
cells
receiving
high
particle
numbers
.

Uncoated
nuclear
genomes
underwent
temporal
transitions
in
condensation
state
and
while
ICP4
efficiently
associated
with
condensed
foci
of
initial
infecting
genomes
,
this
relationship
switched
away
from
residual
longer
lived
condensed
foci
to
increasingly
decondensed
genomes
as
infection
progressed
.

Inhibition
of
transcription
had
no
effect
on
nuclear
entry
but
in
the
absence
of
transcription
,
genomes
persisted
as
tightly
condensed
foci
.

Ongoing
transcription
,
in
the
absence
of
protein
synthesis
,
revealed
a
distinct
spatial
clustering
of
genomes
,
which
we
have
termed
genome
congregation
,
not
seen
with
non-transcribing
genomes
.

Genomes
expanded
to
more
decondensed
forms
in
the
absence
of
DNA
replication
indicating
additional
transitional
steps
.

During
full
progression
of
infection
,
genomes
decondensed
further
,
with
a
diffuse
low
intensity
signal
dissipated
within
replication
compartments
,
but
frequently
with
tight
foci
remaining
peripherally
,
representing
unreplicated
genomes
or
condensed
parental
strands
of
replicated
DNA
.

Uncoating
and
nuclear
entry
was
independent
of
proteasome
function
and
resistant
to
inhibitors
of
nuclear
export
.

Together
with
additional
data
our
results
reveal
new
insight
into
the
spatiotemporal
dynamics
of
HSV
genome
uncoating
,
transport
and
organisation
.

Virtually
all
DNA
virus
classes
as
well
as
many
RNA
viruses
must
deposit
their
genomes
within
the
nucleus
for
transcription
,
genome
replication
and
subsequent
capsid
assembly
.

While
infecting
capsids
have
been
studied
by
various
methods
and
biochemical
approaches
have
been
used
to
investigate
the
bulk
genome
population
characteristics
,
quantitative
spatiotemporal
information
of
the
infecting
genome
itself
at
the
single
particle
level
has
been
lacking
.

This
is
required
for
any
complete
understanding
of
many
critical
aspects
of
virus
infection
and
virus
pathogenesis
.

Using
novel
techniques
in
bioorthogonal
chemistry
to
produce
normal
non-recombinant
viruses
with
readily
traceable
genomes
,
we
provide
the
first
direct
quantitative
spatiotemporal
analysis
of
HSV
genome
transport
and
presentation
to
the
cellular
environment
.

Using
these
techniques
which
discriminate
encapsidated
from
uncoated
genomes
and
input
from
replicated
DNA
,
our
work
provides
a
comprehensive
analysis
,
using
direct
measures
for
genome
detection
not
dependant
on
surrogate
outputs
.

The
results
reveal
completely
novel
aspects
of
early
genome
localisation
and
organisation
not
previously
appreciated
or
amenable
to
study
.

Furthermore
the
work
also
provides
a
roadmap
for
similar
studies
in
other
systems
and
for
future
analysis
of
many
aspects
in
different
fields
of
the
biology
of
infecting
virus
genomes

the
Middle

,
West

,
and
North

,
and
causes

.

To
date
,
no
effective

for

has
been
developed
;
therefore
,
there
is
urgent
need
to
find
an
efficient
method
to
prevent
WNV

.

In
this
study
,
we
prepared
and
evaluated
the
protective
efficacy
of
immune
serum

.

The

significantly
accelerated
the
virus
clearance
in
the
spleens

of

,

Thus
,
equine

is
a
potential

.

The
purpose
of
the
current
systematic
review
is
to
evaluate
the
efficacy
of
antiviral

in
treatment

.

In

order
to
identify

.

Method
:
An
extensive
search
was
performed
in
Medline
,

,
Scopus
,
Web

until

.

Two
independent
researchers
performed
the
screening
,
and
finally
the
related

were
included
.

Results
:
Only
one

on
the
efficacy
of

therapy
in

of

was
found
.

The
results
depicted
that

the
standard

regimen
of

has
no

reported
the
prescription
of

none
of
which
can
be

Conclusion
:
The
current
evidence
impede
researchers
from
proposing
an
appropriate
antiviral
therapy
against

,
making
the
current
situation
a
serious
concern
for
international
organizations
such
as

Health
Organization
(

)
.

In
the
time
of
the
current
pandemic
and
future
epidemics
,
organizations
such
as
WHO
should
pursue
more
proactive
actions
and

well-designed
clinical
trials
so
that
their
results
can
be

Acute
respiratory
distress
syndrome
(
ARDS
)
is
immune-driven
pathologies
that
are
observed
in
severe
cases
of
severe
acute
respiratory
syndrome
coronavirus
(
SARS-CoV
)
infection
.

SARS-CoV
emerged
in
2002
to
2003
and
led
to
a
global
outbreak
of
SARS
.

As
with
the
outcome
of
human
infection
,
intranasal
infection
of
C57BL/6J
mice
with
mouse-adapted
SARS-CoV
results
in
high-titer
virus
replication
within
the
lung
,
induction
of
inflammatory
cytokines
and
chemokines
,
and
immune
cell
infiltration
within
the
lung
.

Using
this
model
,
we
investigated
the
role
of
the
complement
system
during
SARS-CoV
infection
.

We
observed
activation
of
the
complement
cascade
in
the
lung
as
early
as
day
1
following
SARS-CoV
infection
.

To
test
whether
this
activation
contributed
to
protective
or
pathologic
outcomes
,
we
utilized
mice
deficient
in
C3
(
C3
-/-
)
,
the
central
component
of
the
complement
system
.

Relative
to
C57BL/6J
control
mice
,
SARS-CoV-infected
C3
-/mice
exhibited
significantly
less
weight
loss
and
less
respiratory
dysfunction
despite
equivalent
viral
loads
in
the
lung
.

Significantly
fewer
neutrophils
and
inflammatory
monocytes
were
present
in
the
lungs
of
C3
-/mice
than
in
C56BL/6J
controls
,
and
subsequent
studies
revealed
reduced
lung
pathology
and
lower
cytokine
and
chemokine
levels
in
both
the
lungs
and
the
sera
of
C3
-/mice
than
in
controls
.

These
studies
identify
the
complement
system
as
an
important
host
mediator
of
SARS-CoV-induced
disease
and
suggest
that
complement
activation
regulates
a
systemic
proinflammatory
response
to
SARS-CoV
infection
.

Furthermore
,
these
data
suggest
that
SARS-CoV-mediated
disease
is
largely
immune
driven
and
that
inhibiting
complement
signaling
after
SARS-CoV
infection
might
function
as
an
effective
immune
therapeutic
.

IMPORTANCE
The
complement
system
is
a
critical
part
of
host
defense
to
many
bacterial
,
viral
,
and
fungal
infections
.

It
works
alongside
pattern
recognition
receptors
to
stimulate
host
defense
systems
in
advance
of
activation
of
the
adaptive
immune
response
.

In
this
study
,
we
directly
test
the
role
of
complement
in
SARS-CoV
pathogenesis
using
a
mouse
model
and
show
that
respiratory
disease
is
significantly
reduced
in
the
absence
of
complement
even
though
viral
load
is
unchanged
.

Complement-deficient
mice
have
reduced
neutrophilia
in
their
lungs
and
reduced
systemic
inflammation
,
consistent
with
the
observation
that
SARS-CoV
pathogenesis
is
an
immune-driven
disease
.

These
data
suggest
that
inhibition
of
complement
signaling
might
be
an
effective
treatment
option
following
coronavirus
infection
.

Introduction
:
Natalizumab
blocks
α4-integrins
and
is
a
prototypic
agent
for
a
series
of
anti-inflammatory
drugs
that
impair
trafficking
of
immune
cells
into
the
CNS
.

However
,
modulation
of
the
access
of
immune
cells
to
the
CNS
is
associated
with
impaired
immune
surveillance
and
detrimental
viral
infections
of
the
CNS
.

Here
,
we
explored
the
potency
of
cellular
immune
responses
within
the
CNS
to
protect
against
viral
encephalitis
in
mice
with
T
cell
conditional
disruption
of
VLA-4
integrin
(
α4β1
)
expression
.

Results
:
While
VLA-4
expression
in
virus
specific
Th1
cells
is
non-redundant
for
their
ability
to
access
the
CNS
,
α4-integrin
deficient
Th17
cells
enter
the
CNS
compartment
and
generate
an
inflammatory
milieu
upon
intrathecal
vaccinia
virus
(
VV
)
infection
.

However
,
in
contrast
to
Th1
cells
that
can
adopt
direct
cytotoxic
properties
,
Th17
cells
fail
to
clear
the
virus
due
to
insufficient
Eomes
induced
perforin-1
expression
.

Conclusion
:
The
quality
of
the
intrathecal
cellular
antiviral
response
under
conditions
of
impaired
VLA-4
function
jeopardizes
host
protection
.

Our
functional
in
vivo
data
extend
our
mechanistic
understanding
of
anti-viral
immunity
in
the
CNS
and
help
to
estimate
the
risk
potential
of
upcoming
therapeutic
agents
that
target
the
trafficking
of
immune
cells
into
distinct
anatomical
compartments

A
central
tenet
of
medical
ethics
holds
that
it
is
permissible
to
perform
a
medical
intervention
on
a
competent
individual
only
if
that
individual
has
given
informed
consent
to
the
intervention
.

Yet
it
occasionally
seems
morally
permissible
to
carry
out
non-consensual
medical
interventions
on
competent
individuals
for
the
purpose
of
infectious
disease
control
(
IDC
)
.

We
describe
two
different
moral
frameworks
that
have
been
invoked
in
support
of
non-consensual
IDC
interventions
and
identify
five
desiderata
that
might
be
used
to
guide
assessments
of
the
moral
permissibility
of
such
interventions
on
either
kind
of
fundamental
justification
.

We
then
consider
what
these
desiderata
imply
for
the
justifiability
of
carrying
out
non-consensual
medical
interventions
that
are
designed
to
facilitate
rehabilitation
amongst
serious
criminal
offenders
.

We
argue
that
these
desiderata
suggest
that
a
plausible
case
can
be
made
in
favor
of
such
interventions

The

make
it
a
major
public
health
concern
.

The
culture
within
contact
sports
,
such
as
ice
hockey
,
encourages
aggression
that
puts
youth
at
risk
of
TBI
such
as
concussion
.

Newspaper
reports
play
an
important
role
in
conveying
and
shaping
the
culture
around
health-related
behaviors
.

We
qualitatively
studied
reports
about
sport-related
TBI
in
four
major
North
American
newspapers
over
the
last
quarter-century
.

We
used
the
grounded-theory
approach
to
identify
major
themes
and
then
did
a
content
analysis
to
compare
the
frequency
of
key
themes
between
1998-2000
and
2009-2011
.

The
major
themes
were
:
perceptions
of
brain
injury
,
aggression
,
equipment
,
rules
and
regulations
,
and
youth
hockey
.

Across
the
full
study
period
,
newspaper
articles
from
Canada
and
America
portrayed
violence
and
aggression
that
leads
to
TBI
both
as
integral
to
hockey
and
as
an
unavoidable
risk
associated
with
playing
the
game
.

They
also
condemned
violence
in
ice
hockey
,
criticized
the
administrative
response
to
TBI
,
and
recognized
the
significance
of
TBI
.

In
Canada
,
aggression
was
reported
more
often
recently
and
there
was
a
distinctive
shift
in
portraying
protective
equipment
as
a
solution
to
TBI
in
earlier
years
to
a
potential
contributing
factor
to
TBI
later
in
the
study
period
.

American
newspapers
gave
a
greater
attention
to
'perception
of
risks
'
and
the
role
of
protective
equipment
,
and
discussed
TBI
in
a
broader
context
in
the
recent
time
period
.

Newspapers
from
both
countries
showed
similar
recent
trends
in
regards
to
a
need
for
rule
changes
to
curb
youth
sport-related
TBI
.

This
study
provides
a
rich
description
of
the
reporting
around
TBI
in
contact
sport
.

Understanding
this
reporting
is
important

TBI
are
being
appropriately

Cistanche

is
a
traditional
Chinese

.

Here
,
we
confirmed
that
water-extractable
polysaccharides
of
CD
(
WPCD
)
could
modulate
immune
responses
in

and
in

.

In
a
dose-dependent
manner
,
WPCD
significantly
promoted
the
maturation
and
function
of
murine
marrow-derived

,
as
indicated

.

In
addition
,
its
immunomodulatory
activity
was
also
observed
in
mice
.

WPCD
effectively
improved
the
titers
of
IgG
,
IgG
1
and
IgG
2a
and
markedly
enhanced
the
proliferation
of

cells
,
the
production
of
IFN-γ
and
IL-4
in

and

of

in

better
than

.

Furthermore
,

could
markedly
up-regulate

on

To

,
no

Immunomodulators
could
represent
an

strategy
for
the

.

Recently
,
the
role
of
protease-activated
receptors
(
PAR
)
in
inflammation
,
coagulation
and
infection
processes
has
been
of
growing
interest
.

Herein
,
the
effects
of
a
PAR1
agonist
and
a
PAR1
antagonist
on
hMPV
infection
were
investigated
in
BALB/c
mice
.

Intranasal
administration
of
the
PAR1
agonist
resulted
in
increased
weight
loss
and
mortality
of
infected
mice
.

Conversely
,
the
PAR1
antagonist
was
beneficial
to
hMPV
infection
by
decreasing
weight
loss
and
clinical
signs
and
by
significantly
reducing
pulmonary
inflammation
,
pro-inflammatory
cytokine
levels
(
including
IL-6
,
KC
and
MCP-1
)
and
recruitment
of
immune
cells
to
the
lungs
.

In
addition
,
a
significant
reduction
in
pulmonary
viral
titers
was
also
observed
in
the
lungs
of
PAR1
antagonist-treated
mice
.

Despite
no
apparent
direct
effect
on
virus
replication
during
in
vitro
experiments
,
an
important
role
for
PAR1
in
the
regulation
of
furin
expression
in
the
lungs
was
shown
for
the
first
time
.

Further
experiments
indicated
that
the
hMPV
fusion
protein
can
be
cleaved
by
furin
thus
suggesting
that
PAR1
could
have
an
effect
on
viral
infectivity
in
addition
to
its
immunomodulatory
properties
.

Thus
,
inhibition
of
PAR1
by
selected
antagonists
could
represent
an
interesting
strategy
for
decreasing
the
severity
of
paramyxovirus
infections
.

A

to
make
general
recommendations
regarding
biosafety
practices
for

.

A
search
for
LAI
and
zoonoses
in
the
Asia-Pacific
region
using
online
search
engines
revealed
a
relatively
low
number
of
reports
.

Only
27
LAI
reports
were
published
between
1982
and
2016
.

The
most
common
pathogens
associated
with
LAIs
were
dengue
virus
,
Arthroderma
spp.
,
Brucella
spp.
,
Mycobacterium
spp.
,
Rickettsia
spp.
,
and

.

Seventy-eight
percent
(

out
of

occurred
in

countries
(
i.e.
,
Australia
,
Japan
,
South
Korea
,
Singapore

.

Two

and
one
lower-middle

)
reported

.

The
majority

(
fifty-two
percent
(

Five
LAI

from
clinical
or
diagnostic
laboratories
that
are
considered
at
the
frontier
for
zoonotic
disease
detection
.

Governments
and
laboratories
in
the
Asia-Pacific
region
should
be
encouraged
to
report
LAI
cases
as
it
provides
a
useful
tool
to
monitor
unintended
release
of
zoonotic
pathogens
and
to
further
improve
laboratory
biosafety
.

Non-reporting
of
LAI
events

rheumatoid
arthritis
(
RA
)
.

We
have
recently
shown
that
compounds
inducing
NCF1-dependent
oxidative
burst
,
e.g
.

phytol
,
have
a
strong
ameliorating
effect
on
arthritis
in
rats
.

However
,
the
underlying
molecular
mechanism
is
still
not
clearly
understood
.

The
aim
of
this
study
was
to
use
gene-expression
profiling
to
understand
the
protective
effect
against
arthritis
of
activation
of
NADPH
oxidase
in
the
immune
system
.

Results
:
Subcutaneous
administration
of
phytol
leads
to
an
accumulation
of
the
compound
in
the
inguinal
lymph
nodes
,
with
peak
levels
being
reached
approximately
10
days
after
administration
.

Hence
,
global
gene-expression
profiling
on
inguinal
lymph
nodes
was
performed
10
days
after
the
induction
of
pristaneinduced
arthritis
(
PIA
)
and
phytol
administration
.

The
differentially
expressed
genes
could
be
divided
into
two
pathways
,
consisting
of
genes
regulated
by
different
interferons
.

IFN-γ
regulated
the
pathway
associated
with
arthritis
development
,
whereas
IFN-β
regulated
the
pathway
associated
with
disease
protection
through
phytol
.

Importantly
,
these
two
molecular
pathways
were
also
confirmed
to
differentiate
between
the
arthritis-susceptible
dark
agouti
(
DA
)
rat
,
(
with
an
Ncf-1
DA
allele
that
allows
only
low
oxidative
burst
)
,
and
the
arthritis-protected
DA.Ncf-1
E3
rat
(
with
an
Ncf1
E3
allele
that
allows
a
stronger
oxidative
burst
)
.

Conclusion
:
Naturally
occurring
genetic
polymorphisms
in
the
Ncf-1
gene
modulate
the
activity
of
the
NADPH
oxidase
complex
,
which
strongly
regulates
the
severity
of
arthritis
.

We
now
show
that
the
Ncf-1
allele
that
enhances
oxidative
burst
and
protects
against
arthritis
is
operating
through
an
IFN-βassociated
pathway
,
whereas
the
arthritis-driving
allele
operates
through
an
IFN-γ-associated
pathway
.

Treatment
of
arthritis-susceptible
rats
with
an
NADPH
oxidase-activating
substance
,
phytol
,
protects
against
arthritis
.

Interestingly
,
the
treatment
led
to
a
restoration
of
the
oxidative-burst
effect
and
induction
of
a
strikingly
similar
IFN-β-dependent
pathway
,
as
seen
with
the
disease-protective
Ncf1
polymorphism
.

Controlling
the
spread
of
influenza
to
reduce
the
effects
of
infection
on
a
population
is
an
important
mandate
of
public
health
.

Mass
media
reports
on
an
epidemic
or
pandemic
can
provide
important
information
to
the
public
,
and
in
turn
,
can
induce
positive
healthy
behaviour
practices
(
i.e.
,
handwashing
,
social
distancing
)
in
the
individuals
,
that
will
reduce
the
probability
of
contracting
the
disease
.

Mass
media
fatigue
,
however
,
can
dampen
these
effects
.

Mathematical
models
can
be
used
to
study
the
effects
of
mass
media
reports
on
epidemic/
pandemic
outcomes
.

In
this
study
we
employ
a
stochastic
agent
based
model
to
provide
a
quantification
of
mass
media
reports
on
the
variability
in
important
public
health
measurements
.

We
also
include
mass
media
report
data
compiled
by
the
Global
Public
Health
Intelligence
Network
,
to
study
the
effects
of
mass
media
reports
in
the
2009
H1N1
pandemic
.

We
find
that
the
report
rate
and
the
rate
at
which
individuals
relax
their
healthy
behaviours
(
media
fatigue
)
greatly
affect
the
variability
in
important
public
health
measurements
.

When
the
mass
media
reporting
data
is
included
in
the
model
,
two
peaks
of
infection
result
.

Transmission
between
hosts
is
a
critical
part
of
the
viral
lifecycle
.

Recent
studies
of
viral
transmission
have
used
genome
sequence
data
to
evaluate
the
number
of
particles
transmitted
between
hosts
,
and
the
role
of
selection
as
it
operates
during
the
transmission
process
.

However
,
the
interpretation
of
sequence
data
describing
transmission
events
is
a
challenging
task
.

We
here
present
a
novel
and
comprehensive
framework
for
using
shortread
sequence
data
to
understand
viral
transmission
events
,
designed
for
influenza
virus
,
but
adaptable
to
other
viral
species
.

Our
approach
solves
multiple
shortcomings
of
previous
methods
for
this
purpose
;
for
example
,
we
consider
transmission
as
an
event
involving
whole
viruses
,
rather
than
sets
of
independent
alleles
.

We
demonstrate
how
selection
during
transmission
and
noisy
sequence
data
may
each
affect
naive
inferences
of
the
population
bottleneck
,
accounting
for
these
in
our
framework
so
as
to
achieve
a
correct
inference
.

We
identify
circumstances
in
which
selection
for
increased
viral
transmission
may
or
may
not
be
identified
from
data
.

Applying
our
method
to
experimental
data
in
which
transmission
occurs
in
the
presence
of
strong
selection
,
we
show
that
our
framework
grants
a
more
quantitative
insight
into
transmission
events
than
previous
approaches
,
inferring
the
bottleneck
in
a
manner
that
accounts
for
selection
,
both
for
within-host
virulence
,
and
for
inherent
viral
transmissibility
.

Our
work
provides
new
opportunities
for
studying
transmission
processes
in
influenza
,
and
by
extension
,
in
other
infectious
diseases
.

Nipah
virus
(
NiV
)
is
a
recently
emerged
zoonotic
Paramyxovirus
that
causes
regular
outbreaks
in
East
Asia
with
mortality
rate
exceeding
75
%
.

Major
cellular
targets
of
NiV
infection
are
endothelial
cells
and
neurons
.

To
better
understand
virus-host
interaction
,
we
analyzed
the
transcriptome
profile
of
NiV
infection
in
primary
human
umbilical
vein
endothelial
cells
.

We
further
assessed
some
of
the
obtained
results
by
in
vitro
and
in
vivo
methods
in
a
hamster
model
and
in
brain
samples
from
NiV-infected
patients
.

We
found
that
NiV
infection
strongly
induces
genes
involved
in
interferon
response
in
endothelial
cells
.

Among
the
top
ten
upregulated
genes
,
we
identified
the
chemokine
CXCL10
(
interferon-induced
protein
10
,
IP-10
)
,
an
important
chemoattractant
involved
in
the
generation
of
inflammatory
immune
response
and
neurotoxicity
.

In
NiV-infected
hamsters
,
which
develop
pathology
similar
to
what
is
seen
in
humans
,
expression
of
CXCL10
mRNA
was
induced
in
different
organs
with
kinetics
that
followed
NiV
replication
.

Finally
,
we
showed
intense
staining
for
CXCL10
in
the
brain
of
patients
who
succumbed
to
lethal
NiV
infection
during
the
outbreak
in
Malaysia
,
confirming
induction
of
this
chemokine
in
fatal
human
infections
.

This
study
sheds
new
light
on
NiV
pathogenesis
,
indicating
the
role
of
CXCL10
during
the
course
of
infection
and
suggests
that
this
chemokine
may
serve
as
a
potential
new
marker
for
lethal
NiV
encephalitis
.

Background
:
From
October
2010
through
February
2016
,
Arizona
conducted
surveillance
for
severe
acute
respiratory
infections
(
SARI
)
among
adults
hospitalized
in
the
Arizona-Mexico
border
region
.

There
are
few
accurate
mortality
estimates
in
SARI
patients
,
particularly
in
adults
≥
65
years
old
.

The
purpose
of
this
study
was
to
generate
mortality
estimates
among
SARI
patients
that
include
deaths
occurring
shortly
after
hospital
discharge
and
identify
risk
factors
for
mortality
.

Methods
:
Patients
admitted
to
two
sentinel
hospitals
between
2010
and
2014
who
met
the
SARI
case
definition
were
enrolled
.

Demographic
data
were
used
to
link
SARI
patients
to
Arizona
death
certificates
.

Mortality
within
30
days
after
the
date
of
admission
was
calculated
and
risk
factors
were
identified
using
logistic
regression
models
.

Results
:
Among
258
SARI
patients
,
47
%
were
females
,
51
%
were
white
,
non-Hispanic
and
39
%
were
Hispanic
.

The
median
age
was
63
years
(
range
,
19
to
97
years
)
and
80
%
had
one
or
more
pre-existing
health
condition
;
9
%
died
in
hospital
.

Mortality
increased
to
12
%
(
30/258
,
30
%
increase
)
when
electronic
vital
records
and
a
30-day
posthospitalization
time
frame
were
used
.

Being
age
≥
65
years
(
OR
=
4.0
;
95
%
CI
:
1.6-9.9
)
and
having
an
intensive
care
unit
admission
(
OR
=
7.4
;
95
%
CI
:
3.0-17.9
)
were
independently
associated
with
mortality
.

Conclusion
:
The
use
of
electronic
vital
records
increased
SARI-associated
mortality
estimates
by
30
%
.

These
findings
may
help
guide
prevention
and
treatment
measures
,
particularly
in
high-risk
persons
in
this
highly
fluid
border
population
.

Bacteriophage
(
phage
)
,
which
are
viruses
that
infect
bacteria
only
,
have
shown
promise
as
vehicles
for
targeted
cancer
gene
therapy
,
albeit
with
poor
efficiency
.

Recently
,
we
generated
an
improved
version
of
phage
vectors
by
incorporating
cis
genetic
elements
of
adenoassociated
virus
(
AAV
)
.

This
novel
AAV/phage
hybrid
(
AAVP
)
efficiently
delivered
systemically
administered
therapeutic
genes
to
various
tumor
targets
by
displaying
an
integrin
tumor-targeting
ligand
on
the
phage
capsid
.

However
,
inherent
limitations
in
bacteriophage
mean
that
these
AAVP
vectors
still
need
to
be
improved
.

One
of
the
limitations
of
AAVP
in
mammalian
cells
may
be
its
susceptibility
to
proteasomal
degradation
.

The
proteasome
is
upregulated
in
cancer
and
it
is
known
that
it
constitutes
a
barrier
to
gene
delivery
by
certain
eukaryotic
viruses
.

We
report
here
that
inhibition
of
proteasome
improved
targeted
reporter
gene
delivery
by
AAVP
in
cancer
cells
in
vitro
and
in
tumors
in
vivo
after
intravenous
vector
administration
to
tumor-bearing
mice
.

We
also
show
enhanced
targeted
tumor
cell
killing
by
AAVP
upon
proteasome
inhibition
.

The
AAVP
particles
persisted
significantly
in
cancer
cells
in
vitro
and
in
tumors
in
vivo
after
systemic
administration
,
and
accumulated
polyubiquitinated
coat
proteins
.

Our
results
suggest
that
the
proteasome
is
indeed
a
barrier
to
tumor
targeting
by
AAVP
and
indicate
that
a
combination
of
proteasome-inhibiting
drugs
and
AAVP
should
be
considered
for
clinical
anticancer
therapy
.

Programmed
−1
ribosomal
frameshifting
(
PRF
)
and
stop
codon
readthrough
are
two
translational
recoding
mechanisms
utilized
by
some
RNA
viruses
to
express
their
structural
and
enzymatic
proteins
at
a
defined
ratio
.

Efficient
recoding
usually
requires
an
RNA
pseudoknot
located
several
nucleotides
downstream
from
the
recoding
site
.

To
assess
the
strategic
importance
of
the
recoding
pseudoknots
,
we
have
carried
out
a
large
scale
genome-wide
analysis
in
which
we
used
an
in-house
developed
program
to
detect
all
possible
H-type
pseudoknots
within
the
genomic
mRNAs
of
81
animal
viruses
.

Pseudoknots
are
detected
downstream
from
∼85
%
of
the
recoding
sites
,
including
many
previously
unknown
pseudoknots
.

∼78
%
of
the
recoding
pseudoknots
are
the
most
stable
pseudoknot
within
the
viral
genomes
.

However
,
they
are
not
as
strong
as
some
designed
pseudoknots
that
exhibit
roadblocking
effect
on
the
translating
ribosome
.

Strong
roadblocking
pseudoknots
are
not
detected
within
the
viral
genomes
.

These
results
indicate
that
the
decoding
pseudoknots
have
evolved
to
possess
optimal
stability
for
efficient
recoding
.

We
also
found
that
the
sequence
at
the
gag-pol
frameshift
junction
of
HIV1
harbors
potential
elaborated
pseudoknots
encompassing
the
frameshift
site
.

A
novel
mechanism
is
proposed
for
possible
involvement
of
the
elaborated
pseudoknots
in
the
HIV1
PRF
event
.

Vacuolating
cytotoxin
A
(
VacA
)
is
one
of
the
important
virulence
factors
produced
by
H.
pylori
.

VacA
induces
apoptotic
cell
death
,
which
is
potentiated
by
ammonia
.

VacA
also
causes
cell
death
by
mitochondrial
damage
,
via
signaling
pathways
that
are
not
fully
defined
.

Our
aim
was
to
determine
whether
endoplasmic
reticulum
(
ER
)
stress
is
associated
with
VacA-induced
mitochondrial
dysfunction
and
apoptosis
.

We
found
that
C/EBP
homologous
protein
(
CHOP
)
,
a
key
signaling
protein
of
ER
stress-induced
apoptosis
,
was
transcriptionally
up-regulated
following
incubation
of
gastric
epithelial
cells
with
VacA
.

The
effect
of
VacA
on
CHOP
induction
was
significantly
enhanced
by
co-incubation
with
ammonium
chloride
.

Phosphorylation
of
eukaryotic
initiation
factor
2
(
eIF2
)
-alpha
,
which
is
known
to
occur
downstream
of
the
ER
stress
sensor
PKR-like
ERlocalized
eIF2-alpha
kinase
(
PERK
)
and
to
regulate
CHOP
expression
,
was
also
observed
following
incubation
with
VacA
in
the
presence
of
ammonium
chloride
.

Knockdown
of
CHOP
by
siRNA
resulted
in
inhibition
of
VacA-induced
apoptosis
.

Further
studies
showed
that
silencing
of
the
PERK
gene
with
siRNA
attenuated
VacA-mediated
phosphorylation
of

Microbial
infections
are
as
old
as
the
hosts
they
sicken
,
but
interest
in
the
emergence
of
pathogens
and
the
diseases
they
cause
has
been
accelerating
rapidly
.

The
term
'emerging
infectious
disease
'
was
coined
in
the
mid-1900s
to
describe
changes
in
disease
dynamics
in
the
modern
era
.

Both
the
term
and
the
phenomena
it
is
meant
to
characterize
have
evolved
and
diversified
over
time
,
leading
to
inconsistencies
and
confusion
.

Here
,
we
review
the
evolution
of
the
term
'emerging
infectious
disease
'
(
EID
)
in
the
literature
as
applied
to
human
hosts
.

We
examine
the
pathways
(
e.g.
,
speciation
or
strain
differentiation
in
the
causative
agent
vs.
rapid
geographic
expansion
of
an
existing
pathogen
)
by
which
diseases
emerge
.

We
propose
a
new
framework
for
disease
and
pathogen
emergence
to
improve
prioritization
.

And
we
illustrate
how
the
operational
definition
of
an
EID
affects
conclusions
concerning
the
pathways
by
which
diseases
emerge
and
the
ecological
and
socioeconomic
drivers
that
elicit
emergence
.

As
EIDs
appear
to
be
increasing
globally
,
and
resources
for
science
level
off
or
decline
,
the
research
community
is
pushed
to
prioritize
its
focus
on
the
most
threatening
diseases
,
riskiest
potential
pathogens
,
and
the
places
they
occur
.

The
working
definition
of
emerging
infectious
diseases
and
pathogens
plays
a
crucial
role
in
prioritization
,
but
we
argue
that
the
current
definitions
may
be
impeding
these
efforts
.

We
propose
a
new
framework
for
classifying
pathogens
and
diseases
as
``
emerging
''
that
distinguishes
EIDs
from
emerging
pathogens
and
novel
potential
pathogens
.

We
suggest
prioritization
of
:
1
)
EIDs
for
adaptation
and
mitigation
,
2
)
emerging
pathogens
for
preventive
measures
,
and
3
)
novel
potential
pathogens
for
intensive
surveillance
.

The
impact
of
porcine
epidemic
diarrhea
virus
(
PEDv
)
infection
on
the
US
pork
industry
has
mainly
been
attributed
to
the
mortality
that
it
causes
in
suckling
piglets
,
and
,
consequently
,
much
effort
has
been
invested
in
the
quantification
of
its
effect
in
sow
farms
.

However
,
no
information
on
the
performance
of
surviving
pigs
that
were
exposed
to
the
PEDv
as
piglets
is
available
.

Here
,
a
retrospective
cohort
study
to
evaluate
the
impact
of
porcine
epidemic
diarrhea
virus
(
PEDv
)
infection
on
growing
pigs
'
performance
,
as
indicated
by
mortality
,
average
daily
gain
(
ADG
)
,
average
daily
feed
intake
(
ADFI
)
,
and
feed
conversion
ratio
(
FCR
)
was
performed
using
production
records
from
weaned
pigs
in
nursery
and
wean-to-finish
sites
from
sow
farms
that
became
PEDv-infected
between
May
2013
and
June
2014
.

Production
records
from
the
first
batch
of
growing
pigs
weaned
in
infected
flows
after
the
PEDv
outbreak
(
``
infected
batches
''
)
were
compared
with
those
from
pigs
weaned
within
the
previous
14
to
120
days
(
``
control
batches
''
)
.

Performance
records
from
infected
and
control
batches
,
paired
by
flow
,
were
compared
using
non-parametric
paired
tests
.

Mortality
,
ADG
and
FCR
were
significantly
different
in
PEDv-positive
(
infected
)
compared
with
PEDvnegative
(
control
)
batches
,
with
a
mean
increase
of
mortality
and
FCR
of
11
%
and
0.5
,
respectively
,
and
a
decrease
of
ADG
of
0.16
lb/day
.

Our
results
demonstrate
a
poorer
performance
of
growing
pigs
weaned
after
a
PEDv
outbreak
compared
with
those
weaned
within
the
previous
14-120
days
,
suggesting
that
in
addition
to
the
mortality
induced
by
PEDv
in
suckling
pigs
,
the
disease
also
impairs
the
performance
of
surviving
pig
.

These
findings
help
to
quantify
the
impact
of
PEDv
infection
in
the
US
and
,
ultimately
,
contribute
to
efforts
to
quantify
the
cost-effectiveness
of
disease
prevention
and
control
measures
.

Macrodomains
constitute
a
conserved
fold
widely
distributed
that
is
not
only
able
to
bind
ADp-ribose
in
its
free
and
protein-linked
forms
but
also
can
catalyse
the
hydrolysis
of
the
latter
.

they
are
involved
in
the
regulation
of
important
cellular
processes
,
such
as
signalling
,
differentiation
,
proliferation
and
apoptosis
,
and
in
host-virus
response
,
and
for
this
,
they
are
considered
as
promising
therapeutic
targets
to
slow
tumour
progression
and
viral
pathogenesis
.

Although
extensive
work
has
been
carried
out
with
them
,
including
their
classification
into
six
distinct
phylogenetically
clades
,
little
is
known
on
bacterial
macrodomains
,
especially
if
these
latter
are
able
to
remove
poly
(
ADP-ribose
)
polymer
(
PAR
)
from
PARylated
proteins
,
activity
that
only
has
been
confirmed
in
human
TARG1
(
C6orf130
)
protein
.

To
extend
this
limited
knowledge
,
we
demonstrate
,
after
a
comprehensive
bioinformatic
and
phylogenetic
analysis
,
that
Fusobacterium
mortiferum
ATCC
9817
TARG1
(
FmTARG1
)
is
the
first
bacterial
macrodomain
shown
to
have
high
catalytic
efficiency
towards
O-acyl-ADP-ribose
,
even
more
than
hTARG1
,
and
towards
mono-and
poly
(
ADPribosyl
)
ated
proteins
.

Surprisingly
,
FmTARG1
gene
is
also
inserted
into
a
unique
operonic
context
,
only
shared
by
the
distantly
related
Fusobacterium
perfoetens
ATCC
29250
macrodomain
,
which
include
an
immunity
protein
51
domain
,
typical
of
bacterial
polymorphic
toxin
systems
.

Macrodomains
constitute
a
unique
conserved
130-190
amino
acids
three-layered
α/β/α
sandwich
fold
widely
distributed
throughout
the
phylogenetic
scale
.

They
exert
a
regulatory
influence
on
cellular
signalling
,
transcription
,
DNA
repair
,
genomic
stability
,
telomere
dynamics
,
necrosis
and
apoptosis
,
in
addition
to
cell
differentiation
and
proliferation
1
.

They
are
also
involved
in
different
aspects
of
posttranslational
protein
modification
of
the
ADP-ribosylation
signalling
pathway
,
including
reading
,
erasing
,
and
modulating
,
in
combination
with
two
other
important
NAD
+
-using
protein
families
,
poly
(
ADP-ribose
)
polymerases
(
PARPs
)
and
sirtuins
2-9
.

To
carry
out
such
a
plethora
of
functions
,
macrodomains
not
only
bind
ADP-ribose
(
ADPr
)
in
its
free
and
protein-linked
forms
,
but
also
related
ligands
,
such
as
O-acyl-ADP-ribose
(
OAADPr
)
,
and
even
unconnected
ones
,
such
as
poly
(
A
)
or
G-quadruplex
sequences
1
.

In
addition
,
they
could
also
catalyse
the
hydrolysis
of
the
2′,1′′-O-glycosidic
ribose-ribose
bond
in
poly
(
ADP-ribose
)
-modified
proteins
(
also
called
de-PARylation
)
,
the
protein-mono-ADP-ribose
(
MAR
)
ester
bond
(
de-MARylation
)
,
or
the
acyl-ADPr
ester
(
deacylation
)
10-14
.

Macrodomains
have
been
phylogenetically
subdivided
into
six
distinct
clades
1,14
.

MacroD-type
clade
is
the
most
studied
and
comprises
several
distinct
proteins
ranging
from
mono-
(
ADP-ribosyl
)
hydrolases
and
OAADPr
deacetylases
,
such
as
human
MacroD1
and
MacroD2
15
,
Oceanobacillus
iheyensis
MacroD
(
OiMacroD
)
14
and
E.
coli
YmdB
16
,
to
poly
(
A
)
binding
modules
,
such
as
GDAP2
,
a
highly
conserved
protein
found
from
plants
to
humans
with
a
lipid-binding
SEC14
domain
at
the
C
terminus
17
.

Another
class
characterized
by
strong
binding
to
ADP-ribosylated
proteins
without
catalytic
activity
is
the
MacroH2A-type
clade
,
which
include
the
epigenetic
tumour
suppressor
MacroH2A
18,19
,
and
the
macrodomains
from
multidomain
human
PARP9
,
PARP14
,
and
PARP15
,
which
are
involved
in
the
regulation
of
cell
migration
associated
with
lymphoma
(
PARP9
and
PARP14
)
20
,
in
tumour
suppression
(
PARP15
)
21
and
in
the
host-virus
response
(
PARP14
and
PARP15
)
22
.

Macrodomain-containing
proteins
from
Coronaviridae
,
Togaviridae
,
and
Hepeviridae
virus
families
have
also
been
identified
as
a
separate
clade
23,24
,
as
a
part
of
the
multidomain
nonstructural
protein
3
(
nsP3
)
,
which
is
involved
in
host
protein
recruitment
and
viral
replication
25
.

These
macrodomains
,
also
known
as
X
domain
or
Mac1
,
are
present
in
several
(
+
)
ssRNA
viruses
(
e.g
.

hepatitis
E
virus
,
SARS
coronavirus
,
human
coronavirus
HCoV
229E
,
Venezuelan
equine
encephalitis
virus
,
and
Chikungunya
virus
)
and
possess
broad
hydrolase
activity
towards
mono-ADP-ribosylated
proteins
(
PARP15
,
PARP14
and
PARP10
)
26
,
but
only
weak
activity
towards
PAR
automodified
PARP1
27
and
ADP-ribose-1′′-phosphate
28-30
.

In
addition
,
the
nsP3
proteins
of
SARS
coronavirus
(
SARS-CoV
)
and
other
β-coronaviruses
(
MERS-CoV
,
BtVs-BetaCoV/SC2013
)
contain
a
non-conserved
region
that
follows
the
X
domain
(
or
Mac
1
)
with
two
additional
macrodomains
,
Mac2
and
Mac3
,
formerly
known
as
SUD-N
and
SUD-M
25
,
respectively
.

Mac2
and
Mac3
do
not
bind
or
hydrolyse
ADP-ribose
,
but
do
bind
G
quadruplexes
24,31
.

However
,
while
Mac2
has
been
seen
to
be
dispensable
for
the
SARS-CoV
replication/transcription
complex
,
Mac3
is
essential
for
such
processes
,
even
though
it
is
not
conserved
in
all
the
coronaviruses
31
.

Thus
,
viral
macrodomains
seem
to
be
critical
for
viral
pathogenesis
and
evasion
of
the
host
immune
response
,
making
them
an
important
target
for
top-rated
pathogens
that
are
in
need
for
vaccine
development
,
such
as
Chikungunya
virus
27
.

Poly
(
ADP-ribose
)
glycohydrolases
(
PARGs
)
form
another
diverged
clade
,
which
were
recognized
as
macrodomains
only
after
their
seven-stranded
mixed
β-sheet
sandwiched
by
a
five
α-helices
structure
with
the
PARG-specific
GGGX
(
6-8
)
QEE
catalytic
motif
within
loop
1
was
determined
both
in
bacteria
and
human
32,33
.

These
enzymes
release
oligo-or
poly
(
ADPr
)
fragments
from
PARylated
proteins
,
being
predominantly
exoglycohydrolases
with
only
minor
contributions
to
debranching
PAR
polymers
34
.

On
the
other
hand
,
the
Macro-2
type
clade
groups
important
and
ubiquitous
cellular
processing
macrodomain
enzymes
involved
in
the
tRNA
splicing
pathway
,
which
catalyses
the
conversion
of
ADP-ribose-1′′-phosphate
(
Appr-1′′-p
)
to
ADP-ribose
35
,
with
no
de-MARylating
activity
36
.

Their
only
studied
representative
is
the
hypothetical
Saccharomyces
cerevisiae
ATCC
204508/S288c
YMR087W
protein
(
UniProt
code
YMX7_YEAST
)
35
.

By
contrast
,
the
YBR022W
macrodomain
protein
of
the
same
yeast
strain
(
now
named
POA1
)
not
only
converts
Appr-1′′-p
to
ADP-ribose
,
being
responsible
for
∼90
%
of
Appr1p
processing
activity
in
yeast
extracts
,
but
also
produces
de-MARylation
37
.

These
differences
in
activity
could
be
related
to
the
fact
that
POA1
belongs
to
a
different
macrodomain
clade
,
the
ALC1
clade
,
thus
named
for
the
presence
in
it
of
the
chromatin
remodeler
ALC1
(
amplified
in
liver
cancer
1
)
protein
38
,
and
whose
macrodomain
binds
to
sites
of
DNA
damage
by
sensing
PARP1-generated
PAR
39
.

Belonging
to
the
same
clade
is
the
Streptomyces
coelicolor
SCO6735
macrodomain
protein
,
which
hydrolyses
glutamate-linked
protein
mono-ADP-ribosylation
,
and
whose
depletion
significantly
increases
the
production
of
the
antibiotic
actinorhodin
in
S.
coelicolor
40
.

Interestingly
,
a
unique
class
of
macrodomains
with
DNA
ADP-ribosyl
glycohydrolase
activity
,
such
as
Mycobacterium
tuberculosis
and
Thermus
aquaticus
DarG
proteins
,
could
also
be
included
in
this
clade
.

These
last
proteins
reverse
the
thymidine
base-specific
ADP-ribosylation
caused
by
the
corresponding
DarT
toxins
,
a
new
class
of
DNA
ADP-ribosyl
transferases
41
.

These
DarG
proteins
are
structurally
most
similar
to
metazoan
TARG1
(
terminal
ADPr
protein
glycohydrolase1
,
also
known
as
OARD1
or
C6orf130
)
proteins
,
but
with
an
active
site
mostly
positively
charged
to
facilitate
the
binding
of
their
negatively
charged
ssDNA
substrate
41
.

Of
note
,
full-length
DarG
seems
to
inhibit
DarT
through
a
protein-protein
interaction
,
providing
another
layer
of
DarT
regulation
,
in
addition
to
its
macrodomain
hydrolytic
activity
41
.

This
mechanism
of
DarT-DarG
interaction
has
some
parallelism
with
that
recently
described
for
the
bifunctional
immunity
protein
Tri1
,
an
ADP-ribosyl
hydrolase
,
which
protects
the
essential
bacterial
tubulin-like
protein
FtsZ
against
the
ADP-ribosylating
toxin
Tre1
42
.

Interestingly
,
the
above-described
human
TARG1
(
hTARG1
)
is
the
only
known
macrodomain
able
to
hydrolyse
OAADPr
,
MARylated
proteins
10
,
and
the
ribose-acceptor
bond
of
PAR-modified
PARP1
,
removing
the
entire
PAR
chain
en
bloc
12
.

Its
catalytic
lysine
residue
forms
a
covalent
intermediate
with
the
ribose
ring
through
an
Amadori
rearrangement
mechanism
,
followed
by
aspartic
acid-mediated
hydrolysis
12
.

Surprisingly
,
although
this
special
class
of
macrodomain
containing
all
three
activities
has
been
described
in
some
bacteria
as
a
possible
alternative
mechanism
for
reversing
protein
ADP-ribosylation
2
,
they
have
not
previously
been
characterized
.

The
present
work
presents
a
comprehensive
bioinformatic
and
phylogenetic
analysis
of
putative
TARG1
proteins
in
bacterial
organisms
to
better
understand
their
distribution
.

We
have
focused
our
research
on
Fusobacterium
mortiferum
ATCC
9817
TARG1
because
of
its
sequence
identity
with
human
TARG1
,
being
the
first
protein
ever
characterised
from
this
microorganism
.

Interestingly
,
we
show
that
such
an
enzyme
was
the
first
bacterial
macrodomain
able
to
remove
the
PAR
polymer
,
confirming
this
unique
feature
of
TARG1-type
macrodomains
compared
with
MacroD-type
macrodomains
.

In
addition
,
the
operonic
structure
in
which
FmTARG1
gene
is
inserted
is
also
unique
in
nature
and
is
only
shared
with
the
distantly
related
microorganism
F.
perfoetens
ATCC
29250
.

Background
:
Device-associated
infection
(
DAI
)
plays
an
important
part
in
nosocomial
infection
.

Active
surveillance
and
infection
control
are
needed
to
disclose
the
specific
situation
in
each
hospital
and
to
cope
with
this
problem
effectively
.

We
examined
the
rates
of
DAI
by
antimicrobial-resistant
pathogens
,
and
30-day
and
in-hospital
mortality
in
the
intensive
care
unit
(
ICU
)
.

Methods
:
Prospective
surveillance
was
conducted
in
a
mixed
medical
and
surgical
ICU
at
a
major
teaching
hospital
from
2000
through
2008
.

Trend
analysis
was
performed
and
logistic
regression
was
used
to
assess
prognostic
factors
of
mortality
.

Results
:
The
overall
rate
of
DAIs
was
3.03
episodes
per
1000
device-days
.

The
most
common
DAI
type
was
catheter-associated
urinary
tract
infection
(
3.76
per
1000
urinary
catheter-days
)
.

There
was
a
decrease
in
DAI
rates
in
2005
and
rates
of
ventilator-associated
pneumonia
(
VAP
,
3.18
per
1000
ventilator-days
)
have
remained
low
since
then
(
p
<
0.001
)
.

The
crude
rates
of
30-day
(
33.6
%
)
and
in-hospital
(
52.3
%
)
mortality
,
as
well
as
infection
by
antibiotic-resistant
VAP
pathogens
also
decreased
.

The
most
common
antimicrobial-resistant
pathogens
were
methicillin-resistant
Staphylococcus
aureus
(
94.9
%
)
and
imipenem-resistant
Acinetobacter
baumannii
(
p
<
0.001
)
,
which
also
increased
at
the
most
rapid
rate
.

The
rate
of
antimicrobial
resistance
among
Enterobacteriaceae
also
increased
significantly
(
p
<
0.05
)
.

After
controlling
for
potentially
confounding
factors
,
the
DAI
was
an
independent
prognostic
factor
for
both
30-day
mortality
(
OR
2.51
,
95
%
confidence
interval

and
in-hospital

3.61
,
95
%
CI
2.10-3.25
,

)
.

Conclusions
:
The
decrease
in
the
rate
of
DAI
and
infection
by
resistant
bacteria
on
the
impact
of
severe
acute
respiratory
syndrome
can
be
attributed
to
active
infection
control
and
improved
adherence
after
2003
.

Background
:
Immune
evasion
is
one
of
the
recognized
hallmarks
of
cancer
.

Inflammatory
responses
to
cancer
can
also
contribute
directly
to
oncogenesis
.

Since
the
immune
system
is
hardwired
to
protect
the
host
,
there
is
a
possibility
that
cancers
,
regardless
of
their
histological
origins
,
endow
themselves
with
a
common
and
shared
inflammatory
cancerassociated
molecular
pattern
(
iCAMP
)
to
promote
oncoinflammation
.

However
,
the
definition
of
iCAMP
has
not
been
conceptually
and
experimentally
investigated
.

Several
viruses
cause
pulmonary
infections
due
to
their
shared
tropism
with
cells
of
the
respiratory
tract
.

These
respiratory
problems
due
to
viral
infection
become
a
public
health
concern
due
to
rapid
transmission
through
air/aerosols
or
via
direct-indirect
contact
with
infected
persons
.

In
addition
,
the
cross-species
transmission
causes
alterations
to
viral
genetic
makeup
thereby
increasing
the
risk
of
emergence
of
pathogens
with
new
and
more
potent
infectivity
.

With
the
introduction
of
effective
nucleic
acid-based
technologies
,
post
translational
gene
silencing
(
PTGS
)
is
being
increasingly
used
to
silence
viral
gene
targets
and
has
shown
promising
approach
towards
management
of
many
viral
infections
.

Since
several
host
factors
are
also
utilized
by
these
viruses
during
various
stages
of
infection
,
silencing
these
host
factors
can
also
serve
as
promising
therapeutic
tool
.

Several
nucleic
acid-based
technologies
such
as
short
interfering
RNAs
(
siRNA
)
,
antisense
oligonucleotides
,
aptamers
,
deoxyribozymes
(
DNAzymes
)
,
and
ribozymes
have
been
studied
and
used
against
management
of
respiratory
viruses
.

These
therapeutic
nucleic
acids
can
be
efficiently
delivered
through
the
airways
.

Studies
have
also
shown
efficacy
of
gene
therapy
in
clinical
trials
against
respiratory
syncytial
virus
(
RSV
)
as
well
as
models
of
respiratory
diseases
including
severe
acute
respiratory
syndrome
(
SARS
)
,
measles
and
influenza
.

In
this
review
,
we
have
summarized
some
of
the
recent
advancements
made
in
the
area
of
nucleic
acid
based
therapeutics
and
highlighted
the
emerging
roles
of
nucleic
acids
in
the
management
of
some
of
the
severe
respiratory
viral
infections
.

We
have
also
focused
on
the
methods
of
their
delivery
and
associated
challenges
.

A
novel
acetone
extract
from
cottonseed
oil
sludge
was
firstly
discovered
against
plant
viruses
including
Tobacco
mosaic
virus
(
TMV
)
,
Rice
stripe
virus
(
RSV
)
and
Southern
rice
black
streaked
dwarf
virus
(
SRBSDV
)
.

Gossypol
and
β-sitosterol
separated
from
the
acetone
extract
were
tested
for
their
effects
on
anti-TMV
and
analysed
by
nuclear
magnetic
resonance
(
NMR
)
assay
.

In
vivo
and
field
trials
in
different
geographic
distributions
and
different
host
varieties
declared
that
this
extract
mixture
was
more
efficient
than
the
commercial
agent
Ningnanmycin
with
a
broad
spectrum
of
anti-plant-viruses
activity
.

No
phytotoxic
activity
was
observed
in
the
treated
plants
and
environmental
toxicology
showed
that
this
new
acetone
extract
was
environmentally
friendly
,
indicating
that
this
acetone
extract
has
potential
application
in
the
control
of
plant
virus
in
the
future
.

If
and
when
sustained
human-to-human
transmission
of
H5N1
becomes
a
reality
,
the
world
will
no
longer
be
dealing
with
sporadic
avian
flu
borne
along
migratory
flight
paths
of
birds
,
but
aviation
flu
-winged
at
subsonic
speed
along
commercial
air
conduits
to
every
corner
of
planet
Earth
.

Given
that
air
transportation
is
the
one
feature
that
most
differentiates
present
day
transmission
scenarios
from
those
in
1918
,
our
present
inability
to
prevent
spread
of
influenza
by
international
air
travel
,
as
reckoned
by
the
World
Health
Organization
,
constitutes
a
major
weakness
in
the
current
global
preparedness
plan
against
pandemic
flu
.

Despite
the
lessons
of
SARS
,
it
is
surprising
that
aviation-related
health
policy
options
have
not
been
more
rigorously
evaluated
,
or
scientific
research
aimed
at
strengthening
public
health
measures
on
the
air
transportation
front
,
more
energetically
pursued
.

This
review
highlights
the
growing
importance
of
protein
epitope
mimetics
in
the
discovery
of
new
biologically
active
molecules
and
their
potential
applications
in
drug
and
vaccine
research
.

The
focus
is
on
folded
b-hairpin
mimetics
,
which
are
designed
to
mimic
b-hairpin
motifs
in
biologically
important
peptides
and
proteins
.

An
ever-growing
number
of
protein
crystal
structures
reveal
how
b-hairpin
motifs
often
play
key
roles
in
protein-protein
and
protein-nucleic
acid
interactions
.

This
review
illustrates
how
using
protein
structures
as
a
starting
point
for
small-molecule
mimetic
design
can
provide
novel
ligands
as
protein-protein
interaction
inhibitors
,
as
protease
inhibitors
,
and
as
ligands
for
chemokine
receptors
and
folded
RNA
targets
,
as
well
as
novel
antibiotics
to
combat
the
growing
health
threat
posed
by
the
emergence
of
antibiotic-resistant
bacteria
.

The
b-hairpin
antibiotics
are
shown
to
target
a
b-barrel
outer
membrane
protein
(
LptD
)
in
Pseudomonas
sp.
,
which
is
essential
for
the
biogenesis
of
the
outer
cell
membrane
.

Another
exciting
prospect
is
that
protein
epitope
mimetics
will
be
of
increasing
importance
in
synthetic
vaccine
design
,
in
the
emerging
field
of
structural
vaccinology
.

Crystal
structures
of
protective
antibodies
bound
to
their
pathogen-derived
epitopes
provide
an
ideal
starting
point
for
the
design
of
synthetic
epitope
mimetics
.

The
mimetics
can
be
delivered
to
the
immune
system
in
a
highly
immunogenic
format
on
the
surface
of
synthetic
virus-like
particles
.

The
scientific
challenges
in
molecular
design
remain
great
,
but
the
potential
significance
of
success
in
this
area
is
even
greater
.

Metagenomics
is
helping
to
expand
the
known
diversity
of
viruses
,
especially
of
those
with
poorly
studied
hosts
in
remote
areas
.

the
Neotropical
region
harbors
a
considerable
diversity
of
avian
species
that
may
play
a
role
as
both
host
and
short-distance
vectors
of
unknown
viruses
.

Viral
metagenomics
of
cloacal
swabs
from
50
Neotropical
birds
collected
in
French
Guiana
revealed
the
presence
of
four
complete
astrovirus
genomes
.

they
constitute
an
early
diverging
novel
monophyletic
clade
within
the
Avastrovirus
phylogeny
,
representing
a
putative
new
astrovirus
species
(
provisionally
designated
as
Avastrovirus
5
)
according
to
the
International
Committee
on
Taxonomy
of
Viruses
(
ICTV
)
classification
criteria
.

their
genomic
organization
shares
some
characteristics
with
Avastrovirus
but
also
with
Mamastrovirus
.

The
pan-astrovirus
RT-PCR
analysis
of
the
cloacal
samples
of
406
wild
Neotropical
birds
showed
a
community-level
prevalence
of
4.9
%
(
5.1
%
in
passerines
,
the
highest
described
so
far
in
this
order
of
birds
)
.

By
screening
birds
of
a
remote
region
,
we
expanded
the
known
host
range
of
astroviruses
to
the
avian
families
Cardinalidae
,
Conopophagidae
,
Furnariidae
,
thamnophilidae
,
Turdidae
and
Tyrannidae
.

Our
results
provide
important
first
insights
into
the
unexplored
viral
communities
,
the
ecology
,
epidemiology
and
features
of
host-pathogen
interactions
that
shape
the
evolution
of
avastroviruses
in
a
remote
Neotropical
rainforest
.

The
last
decades
have
witnessed
a
broadening
of
the
global
diversity
of
viruses
thanks
to
rapidly
evolving
random
amplification
sequencing
technology
.

Next
Generation
Sequencing
(
NGS
)
has
revolutionized
our
knowledge
by
not
only
uncovering
the
diversity
of
viruses
at
an
unprecedented
rate
,
but
also
by
allowing
to
gain
insight
into
their
ecology
and
distribution
,
helping
to
disentangle
the
network
that
connects
viruses
with
their
hosts
and
the
geographical
scenario
in
which
such
interactions
take
place
1
.

However
,
deciphering
the
global
virome
and
its
structure
becomes
challenging
not
just
because
of
the
technical
difficulties
associated
with
the
screening
of
diverse
viruses
,
but
because
their
many
hosts
are
often
understudied
,
particularly
those
from
remote
areas
.

The
Neotropical
region
is
one
such
example
;
being
among
the
most
biodiverse
realms
on
Earth
,
Neotropical
rainforests
are
candidates
to
host
and
conserve
relevant
parts
of
the
virosphere
diversity
2
.

in

Given

the

Specific

most

to
patients
with
primary
immunodeficiency

are
not
routinely
evaluated
in

.

A
polyclonal
immunoglobulin
prepared
from
plasma
of
donors
having
high
neutralizing
antibody
titers
to
respiratory
syncytial

(
RSV
)
was
studied
for
the
presence
of
antibody
titers
against
seven
additional
respiratory
viruses
.

While
donors
were
not
selected
for
antibody
titers
other
than
against
RSV
,
the
immunoglobulin
preparation
had
significantly
higher

To
consider
this
as
a
donor-specific
attribute
,
20
random
donor
plasma
samples
were
studied
individually
and
identified
a
significant
correlation
between
the
RSV
antibody
titer
and
other
respiratory

titers
:
donors
with
high
RSV
titers
were
more
likely
to
have
higher
titers
to
other
respiratory
viruses
.

These
findings
suggest
either
some
humoral
antiviral
response
bias
or
more
frequent
viral

of
certain

Influenza
viruses
of
avian
origin
continue
to
pose
pandemic
threats
to
human
health
.

Some
of
the
H5N1
and
H9N2
virus
subtypes
induce
markedly
elevated
cytokine
levels
when
compared
with
the
seasonal
H1N1
virus
.

We
previously
showed
that
H5N1/97
hyperinduces
tumor
necrosis
factor
(
TNF
)
-alpha
through
p38
mitogen
activated
protein
kinase
(
MAPK
)
.

However
,
the
detailed
mechanisms
of
p38MAPK
activation
and
TNF-alpha
hyperinduction
following
influenza
virus
infections
are
not
known
.

Negative
feedback
regulations
of
cytokine
expression
play
important
roles
in
avoiding
overwhelming
production
of
proinflammatory
cytokines
.

Here
we
hypothesize
that
protein
phosphatases
are
involved
in
the
regulation
of
cytokine
expressions
during
influenza
virus
infection
.

We
investigated
the
roles
of
protein
phosphatases
including
MAPK
phosphatase-1
(
MKP-1
)
and
protein
phosphatase
type
2A
(
PP2A
)
in
modulating
p38MAPK
activation
and
downstream
TNF-alpha

human
monocyte-derived
macrophages
(

)
infected
with
H9N2/G1
or
H1N1
influenza

.

We
demonstrate
that
H9N2/G1
virus
activated
p38MAPK
and
hyperinduced
TNF-alpha
production
in
PBMac
when
compared
with
H1N1
virus
.

H9N2/G1
induced
PP2A
activity
in
PBMac
and
,
with
the
treatment
of
a
PP2A
inhibitor
,
p38MAPK
phosphorylation
and
TNF-alpha
production
were
further
increased
in
the
virus-infected
macrophages
.

However
,
H9N2/G1
did
not
induce
the
expression
of
PP2A
indicating
that
the
activation
of
PP2A
is
not
mediated
by
p38MAPK
in
virus-infected
PBMac
.

On
the
other
hand
,
PP2A

A
better
understanding
of
the
host
pathogen
interaction
is
required
to
develop
effective
therapies
to
treat
DENV
.

In
particular
,
very
little
is
known
about
how
cellular
RNA
binding
proteins
interact
with
viral
RNAs
.

RNAs
within
cells
are
not
naked
;
rather
they
are
coated
with
proteins
that
affect
localization
,
stability
,
translation
and
(
for
viruses
)
replication
.

Seventy-nine
novel
RNA
binding
proteins
for
dengue
virus
(
DENV
)
were
identified
by
crosslinking
proteins
to
dengue
viral
RNA
during
a
live
infection
in
human
cells
.

These
cellular
proteins
were
specific
and
distinct
from
those
previously
identified
for
poliovirus
,
suggesting
a
specialized
role
for
these
factors
in
DENV
amplification
.

Knockdown
of
these
proteins
demonstrated
their
function
as
viral
host
factors
,
with
evidence
for
some
factors
acting
early
,
while
others
late
in
infection
.

Their
requirement
by
DENV
for
efficient
amplification
is
likely
specific
,
since
protein
knockdown
did
not
impair
the
cell
fitness
for
viral
amplification
of
an
unrelated
virus
.

The
protein
abundances
of
these
host
factors
were
not
significantly
altered
during
DENV
infection
,
suggesting
their
interaction
with
DENV
RNA
was
due
to
specific
recruitment
mechanisms
.

However
,
at
the
global
proteome
level
,
DENV
altered
the
abundances
of
proteins
in
particular
classes
,
including
transporter
proteins
,
which
were
down
regulated
,
and
proteins
in
the
ubiquitin
proteasome
pathway
,
which
were
up
regulated
.

The
method
for
identification
of
host
factors
described
here
is
robust
and
broadly
applicable
to
all
RNA
viruses
,
providing
an
avenue
to
determine
the
conserved
or
distinct
mechanisms

through
which
diverse
viruses
manage
the
viral
RNA
within

.

This
study
significantly
increases
the
number
of
cellular
factors
known
to
interact
with
DENV
and
reveals
how
DENV
modulates
and
usurps
cellular
proteins
for
efficient
amplification
.

DENV
is
the
most
important
mosquito
transmitted
viral
disease
in
humans
causing
almost
400
million
infections
each
year
.

Early
detection
is
possible
;
however
,
there
are
no
antivirals
or
vaccines
available
for
this
potentially
lethal
virus
.

Host
factors
that
are
required
for
viral
amplification
provide
an
attractive
target
for
antiviral
therapeutics
for
rapidly
evolving
RNA
viruses
.

However
,
only
a
handful
of
DENV
host
factors
are
known
.

This
study
reports
identification
of
79
novel
dengue
RNA
binding
proteins
using
a
largescale
analysis
of
cellular
proteins
that
interact
with
the
DENV
RNA
during
a
live
infection
in
human
cells
.

Importantly
,
this
analysis
proved
to
have
a
remarkably
low
false
discovery
rate
and
the
confirmed
host
factors
appear
to
be
specific
to
DENV
without
compromising
the
fitness
of
the
cell
for
viral
amplification
of
other

.

Furthermore
,
these

shown
to
be
required
at
both
early
and
late
stages

HGDP-CEPH
panel
;
these
samples
covered
most
of
alleles
of
this
VNTR
locus
present
in
human
populations
.

We
identified
a
limited
number
of
haplotypes
among
the
basic
repeat
subunits
that
is
69
base
pairs
in
length
.

Only
8
haplotypes
were
found
.

Their
sequence
identities
were
determined
in
the
290
chromosomes
.

VNTR
alleles
of
different
repeat
length
(
from
4
to
9
repeats
)
were
analyzed
for
composition
and
orientation
of
these
subunits
.

Our
results
showed
that
the
subunit
configuration
of
the
same
repeat
number
of
VNTR
locus
from
different
populations
were
,
in
fact
,
virtually
identical
.

It
implies
that
most
of
the
VNTR
alleles
existed
before
dispersion
of
modern
humans
outside
Africa
.

Further
analyses
indicate
that
the
present
diversity
profile
of
this
locus
in
worldwide
populations
is
generated
from
the
effect
of
migration
of
different
tribes
and
neutral
evolution
.

Our
findings
do
not
support
the
hypothesis
that
the
origin
of
the
VNTR
alleles
were
arisen
by
independent
(
separate
)
mutation
events
and
caused
by
differential
allele
advantage
and
natural
selection
as
suggested
by
previous
report
based
on
SNP
data

Objectives
To
identify
the
factors
that
influence
hand
hygiene
compliance
of
final
year
medical
students
,
using
a
theoretical
behavioural
framework
.

Design
Cross-sectional
survey
assessing
self-reported
compliance
and
its
behavioural
correlates
.

Internships
of
medical
students
in
the
Netherlands
.

322
Medical
students
of
the
Erasmus
Medical
Center
were
recruited
over
a
period
of
12
months
during
the
internship
Public
health
,
which
is
the
final
compulsory
internship
after
an
18
month
rotation
schedule
in
all
major
specialties
.

Behavioural
factors
influencing
compliance
to
hand-hygiene
were
measured
by
means
of
a
questionnaire
based
on
the
Theory
of
Planned
Behaviour
and
Social
Ecological
Models
.

Multiple
linear
regression
analysis
was
used
to
identify
the
effect
of
including
attitudes
,
social
norms
,
selfefficacy
,
knowledge
,
risk
perception
and
habit
on
hand
hygiene
compliance
.

We
included
313
students
in
the
analysis
(
response
of
97
%
)
.

The
behavioural
model
explained
40
%
of
the
variance
in
self-reported
compliance
(
adjusted
R
2
=
0.40
)
.

Hand
hygiene
compliance
was
strongly
influenced
by
attitudes
(
perceived
outcomes
of
preventive
actions
)
,
self-efficacy
(
perception
of
the
ability
to
perform
hand
hygiene
at
the
clinical
ward
)
and
habit
,
but
was
not
associated
with
knowledge
and
risk
perception
.

Targeting
medical
students
'
behaviour
should
focus
on
the
empowerment
of
these
juniors
and
provide
them
with
evidence
on
the
health
benefits
of
prevention
,
rather
than
increasing
their
factual
knowledge
of
procedures
.

Clinical
teaching
environments
could
help
them
form
good
patient
safety
habits
during
this
vital
phase
of
their
career

The
hand

behaviour
of
medical
students
is
investigated
from
a
behavioural
perspective
in
a
large
sample
of

at
the
same
stage
of
their
internships
.

.

The
main
limitations
of
this

are
its
cross-sectional
design
and
the
self-reported
compliance
with

The
Severe
Acute
Respiratory
Syndrome
Coronavirus
(
SARS-CoV
)
is
the
etiological
agent
for
the
infectious
disease
,
SARS
,
which
first
emerged
10
years
ago
.

SARS-CoV
is
a
zoonotic
virus
that
has
crossed
the
species
barriers
to
infect
humans
.

Bats
,
which
harbour
a
diverse
pool
of
SARS-like
CoVs
(
SL-CoVs
)
,
are
believed
to
be
the
natural
reservoir
.

The
SARS-CoV
surface
Spike
(
S
)
protein
is
a
major
antigenic
determinant
in
eliciting
neutralizing
antibody
production
during
SARS-CoV
infection
.

In
our
previous
work
,
we
showed
that
a
panel
of
murine
monoclonal
antibodies
(
mAbs
)
that
target
the
S2
subunit
of
the
S
protein
are
capable
of
neutralizing
SARS-CoV
infection
in
vitro
(

.

In
this
study
,
we
report
our
findings
on
the
characterization
of
one
of
these
mAbs
,
known
as
1A9
,
which
binds
to
the
S
protein
at
a
novel
epitope
within
the
S2
subunit
at
amino
acids
1111-1130
.

MAb
1A9
is
a
broadly
neutralizing
mAb
that
prevents
viral
entry
mediated
by
the
S
proteins
of
human
and
civet
SARS-CoVs
as
well
as
bat
SL-CoVs
.

By
generating
mutant
SARS-CoV
that
escapes
the
neutralization
by
mAb
1A9
,
the
residue
D1128
in
S
was
found
to
be
crucial
for
its
interaction
with
mAb
1A9
.

S
protein
containing
the
substitution
of
D1128
with
alanine
(
D1128A
)
exhibited
a
significant
decrease
in
binding
capability
to
mAb
1A9
compared
to
wild-type
S
protein
.

By
using
a
pseudotyped
viral
entry
assay
,
it
was
shown
that
the
D1128A
substitution
in
the
escape
virus
allows
it
to
overcome
the
viral
entry
blockage
by
mAb
1A9
.

In
addition
,
the
D1128A
mutation
was
found
to
exert
no
effects
on
the
S
protein
cell
surface
expression
and
incorporation
into
virion
particles
,
suggesting
that
the
escape
virus
retains
the
same
viral
entry
property
as
the
wild-type
virus
.

Bats
are
reservoir
animals
harboring
many
important
pathogenic
viruses
and
with
the
capability
of
transmitting
these
to
humans
and
other
animals
.

To
establish
an

bats
of
six
species
from
two
Myanmar
counties
close

collected
and
tested
for
their
virome
through
metagenomics
by
Solexa

bioinformatic
analysis
.

In
total
,
3,742,314
reads
of
114
bases
were
generated
,

over
86

of
which
26,698
(

were
recognizable

viral
families
.

Of
the
viral
contigs
45
%
(

The
metagenomic
results
were
confirmed
by
PCR
of
selected
viruses
in
all
bat
samples
followed
by
phylogenetic
analysis
,
which
has
led
to
the

of
the
genera
Mamastrovirus

Background
:
Cats

)
-related
symptoms
are
commonly
presented
to
veterinary
practitioners
.

Various
clinical
manifestations
have
been
attributed
to
FCV
,

to
address
the
association
between
clinical
symptoms

.

Results
:
Oropharyngeal

nasal
and
conjunctival

were
collected
in
24
veterinary

from
200
FCV-suspect
and
100
healthy
cats
originating
from
19

were
found
to
be

factors
for
FCV

.

In
healthy

were
found
to
be
associated
with
FCV
infection
.

Based
on
an
univariable
approach
,
FCV-suspect
cats
were
found
to
be
significantly
less
often
FCV-positive
when
vaccinated
(
0.48

Oral
ulcerations
,
salivation
,
gingivitis
and
stomatitis
,
but
not
classical
signs
of
URTD
were
significantly
associated
with
FCV
infection
(

)
.

Conclusions
:
FCV
was
detected
in
less
than
half
of
the
cats
that
were
judged
FCV-suspect
by
veterinary
practitioners
.

For
a
clinical
diagnosis
,
FCV-related
symptoms
should
be
revisited
.

FCV
infection
was
present
in
some
healthy
cats
,
underlining
the
importance
of
asymptomatic
carriers
in
FCV
epidemiology
.

To
reduce
FCV-related
problems
in
multicat
environments
,
reduction
of
group
size
in
addition
to
the
generally
recommended
vaccination
are
advocated
.

Bluetongue
virus
(
BTV
)
,
a
complex
double-stranded
segmented
RNA
virus
,
has
been
found
to
initiate
cellular
autophagy
for
its
own
benefit
.

Here
,
with
a
view
to
understanding
the
underlying
mechanisms
,
we
first
systematically
dissected
the
exact
signaling
network
in
BTV-induced
autophagy
.

We
found
that
the
activity
of
mTOR
,
a
crucial
pivot
,
was
inhibited
by
BTV1
infection
,
subsequently
leading
to
downstream
p70S6K
suppression
and
autophagy
initiation
.

We
then
explored
the
upstream
regulators
of
mTOR
and
analyzed
their
activities
via
a
series
of
assays
.

We
found
BTV1-induced
autophagy
to
be
independent
of
the
ERK1/2
signaling
pathway
.

However
,
the
BTV1-induced
inhibition
of
PI3K/Akt
was
found
to
be
partially
responsible
for
mTOR
inactivation
and
subsequent
autophagy
initiation
.

Furthermore
,
we
found
unexpectedly
that
AMPK
seemed
to
play
a
more
important
role
in
BTV1induced
autophagy
.

Elevated
[
Ca
2+
]
cyto
-mediated
activation
of
CaMKKβ
exactly
managed
the
activation
of
AMPK
,
which
then
positively
regulated
autophagy
through
suppressing
mTOR
.

We
must
emphasize
that
TSC2
is
a
fatal
mediator
between
upstream
Akt
or
AMPK
and
downstream
mTOR
through
its
phosphorylation
.

Taken
together
,
our
data
suggested
that
the
BTV1-induced
inhibition
of
the
Akt-TSC2-mTOR
pathway
and
the
upregulation
of
the
AMPK-TSC2-mTOR
pathway
both
contributed
to
autophagy
initiation
and
further
favored
virus
replication
.

to
promote

However
,
subsequent
corresponding
mechanisms
underlying
these
observations
have
not
yet
been
elucidated
.

Autophagy
is
activated
in
response
to
extra-or
intracellular
stimuli
and
signals
such
as
starvation
,
hypoxia
,
ER
stress
,
and
pathogen
infection
.

Many
efforts
have
been
made
in
the
past
few
years
to
decipher
the
regulatory
network
of
autophagy
initiation
from
yeast
to
mammals
[

[
16
]
[

]
.

Several
signaling
cascades
have
been
reported
to
regulate
autophagy
.

The
major
control
complex
for
autophagy
is
the
mammalian
target
of
rapamycin
(
mTOR
)
,
which
,
when
active
,
inhibits
the
initiation
of
the
pathway
18-20
.

Many
diverse
cellular
signals
converge
on
mTOR
complex
1
(
mTORC1
)
to
regulate
autophagy
upstream
of
the
core
machinery
21
.

The
serine/threonine
kinase
Akt
(
also
known
as
PKB
)
has
been
shown
to
modulate
autophagic
activity
regulated
by
the
phosphoinositide
3-kinase
(
PI3K
)
pathway
22,23
.

Mutations
causing
Akt
activation
or
inactivation
would
,
respectively
,
suppress
and
induce
autophagy
.

Molecules
upstream
of
mTOR
,
such
as
AMP-activated
protein
kinase
(
AMPK
)
and
extracellular
signal-regulated
kinase
1/2
(
ERK1/2
)
,
have
been
shown
to
inhibit
mTORC1
and
lead
to
activation
of
the
autophagic
process
.

AMPK
,
a
crucial
factor
in
sensing
cellular
energy
and
ion
homeostasis
24,25
,
negatively
regulates
mTOR
either
by
directly
inhibiting
mTOR
or
by
activating
tuberous
sclerosis
protein
2
(
TSC2
)
protein
,
an
upstream
negative
effector
of
mTOR
26-28
.

Mitogen-activated
protein
kinases
(
MAPKs
)
are
central
molecules
mediating
signaling
pathways
in
innate
immunity
.

To
date
,
seven
distinct
groups
of
MAPKs
have
been
characterized
in
mammalian
cells
.

Of
these
seven
,
the
most
extensively
studied
are
ERK1/2
,
c-Jun
N-terminal
kinases
(
JNKs
)
and
p38
MAPKs
(
p38
α
/β
/γ
/δ
)
,
which
have
also
been
reported
to
regulate
autophagy
activity
29
.

In
addition
,
endoplasmic
reticulum
(
ER
)
stress
,
p53
,
nuclear
factor-κ
B
(
NF-κ
B
)
and
other
mTOR-independent
pathways
are
also
involved
in
the
regulatory
network
of
autophagy
[

.

There
are
reports
that
many
viruses
can
activate
and
exploit
certain
signaling
pathways
related
to
autophagy
for
more
efficient
replication
,
depending
on
the
virus
type
or
stage
of
viral
infection
33,34
.

However
,
until
now
,
for
BTV
,
the
precise
mechanisms
and
signaling
pathways
of
modulating
cellular
autophagy
have
remained
largely
unknown
.

Based
on
this
information
,
we
have
undertaken
a
comprehensive
investigation
to
explore
the
autophagy
signaling
network
initiated
by
BTV
infection
,
focusing
on
these
vital
and
canonical
candidates
.

Our
results
demonstrate
that
BTV1
induces
autophagy
in
BSR
cells
by
setting
off
distinct
cascade
reactions
involving
Akt
,
AMPK
,
and
ERK1/2
to
repress
central
mTOR
for
its
own
benefits
.

Background
:
Phylogenies
of
rapidly
evolving
pathogens
can
be
difficult
to
resolve
because
of
the
small
number
of
substitutions
that
accumulate
in
the
short
times
since
divergence
.

To
improve
resolution
of
such
phylogenies
we
propose
using
insertion
and
deletion
(
indel
)
information
in
addition
to
substitution
information
.

We
accomplish
this
through
joint
estimation
of
alignment
and
phylogeny
in
a
Bayesian
framework
,
drawing
inference
using
Markov
chain
Monte
Carlo
.

Joint
estimation
of
alignment
and
phylogeny
sidesteps
biases
that
stem
from
conditioning
on
a
single
alignment
by
taking
into
account
the
ensemble
of
near-optimal
alignments
.

We
introduce
a
novel
Markov
chain
transition
kernel
that
improves
computational
efficiency
by
proposing
non-local
topology
rearrangements
and
by
block
sampling
alignment
and
topology
parameters
.

In
addition
,
we
extend
our
previous
indel
model
to
increase
biological
realism
by
placing
indels
preferentially
on
longer
branches
.

We
demonstrate
the
ability
of
indel
information
to
increase
phylogenetic
resolution
in
examples
drawn
from
within-host
viral
sequence
samples
.

We
also
demonstrate
the
importance
of
taking
alignment
uncertainty
into
account
when
using
such
information
.

Finally
,
we
show
that
codon-based
substitution
models
can
significantly
affect
alignment
quality
and
phylogenetic
inference
by
unrealistically
forcing
indels
to
begin
and
end
between
codons
.

These
results
indicate
that
indel
information
can
improve
phylogenetic
resolution
of
recently
diverged
pathogens
and
that
alignment
uncertainty
should
be
considered
in
such
analyses
.

Severe

immunological
abnormalities

.

Thirty-three
SFTS
patients
were
admitted
to
Jiangsu
People

Hospital
,
Nanjing
,
China
,
and
diagnosis
was
made
based
on
the
clinical

and
positive
viral

detected
by
RT-PCR
.

Four
patients

Blood
samples
were
collected
every

day
between
Day
5
and
Day
15
from
the
onset
of

Samples
from

.

Peak
viral

and
IL-10
were
significantly
higher
in

patients
compared
to

.

Viral

,
serum

,
and
cytokines
declined
in
survivors
within
2
weeks
from
onset
of
fever
.

CD69+
T
cells
were
elevated
early
after
infection
while
HLA-DR+
and
CTLA4+
T
cells
were
elevated
during
the
recovery
phase
of
those
who
survived
.

High

SFTSV
viral
load
was
concurrently
observed
with
reduced
PLT
,
elevated
serum
enzymes
,
elevated
pro-inflammatory
and
anti-inflammatory
cytokines
,
and
activation
of
CD69+
T
cells
.

The
degree
and
pattern
of
changes
in
these
parameters
may
indicate
the
clinical
outcome
in
SFTSV-infected
patients
.

When
controlling
an
emerging
outbreak
of
an
infectious
disease
,
it
is
essential
to
know
the
key
epidemiological
parameters
,
such
as
the
basic
reproduction
number
R
0
and
the
control
effort
required
to
prevent
a
large
outbreak
.

These
parameters
are
estimated
from
the
observed
incidence
of
new
cases
and
information
about
the
infectious
contact
structures
of
the
population
in
which
the
disease
spreads
.

However
,
the
relevant
infectious
contact
structures
for
new
,
emerging
infections
are
often
unknown
or
hard
to
obtain
.

Here
,
we
show
that
,
for
many
common
true
underlying
heterogeneous
contact
structures
,
the
simplification
to
neglect
such
structures
and
instead
assume
that
all
contacts
are
made
homogeneously
in
the
whole
population
results
in
conservative
estimates
for
R
0
and
the
required
control
effort
.

This
means
that
robust
control
policies
can
be
planned
during
the
early
stages
of
an
outbreak
,
using
such
conservative
estimates
of
the
required
control
effort

Transmissible
gastroenteritis
virus
(
TGEV
)
genome
contains
three
accessory
genes
:
3a
,
3b
and
7
.

Gene
7
is
only
present
in
members
of
coronavirus
genus
a1
,
and
encodes
a
hydrophobic
protein
of
78
aa
.

To
study
gene
7
function
,
a
recombinant
TGEV
virus
lacking
gene
7
was
engineered
(
rTGEV-D7
)
.

Both
the
mutant
and
the
parental
(
rTGEV-wt
)
viruses
showed
the
same
growth
and
viral
RNA
accumulation
kinetics
in
tissue
cultures
.

Nevertheless
,
cells
infected
with
rTGEV-D7
virus
showed
an
increased
cytopathic
effect
caused
by
an
enhanced
apoptosis
mediated
by
caspase
activation
.

Macromolecular
synthesis
analysis
showed
that
rTGEV-D7
virus
infection
led
to
host
translational
shut-off
and
increased
cellular
RNA
degradation
compared
with
rTGEV-wt
infection
.

An
increase
of
eukaryotic
translation
initiation
factor
2
(
eIF2a
)
phosphorylation
and
an
enhanced
nuclease
,
most
likely
RNase
L
,
activity
were
observed
in
rTGEV-D7
virus
infected
cells
.

These
results
suggested
that
the
removal
of
gene
7
promoted
an
intensified
dsRNA-activated
host
antiviral
response
.

In
protein
7
a
conserved
sequence
motif
that
potentially
mediates
binding
to
protein
phosphatase
1
catalytic
subunit
(
PP1c
)
,
a
key
regulator
of
the
cell
antiviral
defenses
,
was
identified
.

We
postulated
that
TGEV
protein
7
may
counteract
host
antiviral
response
by
its
association
with
PP1c
.

In
fact
,
pull-down
assays
demonstrated
the
interaction
between
TGEV
protein
7
,
but
not
a
protein
7
mutant
lacking
PP1c
binding
motif
,
with
PP1
.

Moreover
,
the
interaction
between
protein
7
and
PP1
was
required
,
during
the
infection
,
for
eIF2a
dephosphorylation
and
inhibition
of
cell
RNA
degradation
.

Inoculation
of
newborn
piglets
with
rTGEV-D7
and
rTGEV-wt
viruses
showed
that
rTGEV-D7
virus
presented
accelerated
growth
kinetics
and
pathology
compared
with
the
parental
virus
.

Overall
,
the
results
indicated
that
gene
7
counteracted
host
cell
defenses
,
and
modified
TGEV
persistence
increasing
TGEV
survival
.

Therefore
,
the
acquisition
of
gene
7
by
the
TGEV
genome
most
likely
has
provided
a
selective
advantage
to
the
virus
.

Background
and

rapidly
spread
throughout
the
Middle

.

The
virus
poses
a
significant
global
public

In
this

adenoviral-based
vaccine
encoding
the
spike
1
(
S1
)
subunit
of
the
MERS-CoV
genome
was
constructed
,
and
its
humoral
,
and
cellular
immune
responses
were
evaluated
in
mice
.

Mice
were
immunized
initially
by
intramuscular
injection
and
boosted
3
weeks
later
by
intranasal
application
.

Expression
of
the
S1

6
after
the
first

.

Antigen-specific
humoral

responses
were
evaluated
in
serum

in
cell
culture
following
in

stimulation
with
a
specific
9-mer
epitope
within
the
S1
protein
(
CYSSLILDY

.

Results
:
S1
protein
expression
was
only
detected
by
IHC
in
the
kidneys
of
the
Ad-MERS-S1
group
at
week
6
from
first
immunization
,
and
in
both
lungs
and
kidneys
of
Ad-MERS-S1
group
by
conventional
PCR
at
weeks
3
and
5
post-prime
.

The
vaccine
elicited
a
specific
S1-immunoglobulin
G
antibody
response
,
which
was
detected
in
the
sera
of
the
vaccinated
mice
at
weeks
4
and
6
from
the
onset
of
the
first

.

There
was
a
significant
increase
in
the
amount
of
Th1-related
cytokines
(
interferon-γ
and
interleukin

a
significant
decrease
in
the
Th2-related
cytokine
IL-4
in
splenocyte
cell
culture
of
the
vaccinated
group
compared
with
the
control
groups
.

The
results
of
this
study
suggest
that
this
recombinant
adenovirus
vaccine
encoding
the
S1
subunit
of

elicits
potentially
protective
antigen-specific
humoral

cellular
immune
responses
in
mice

evaluation
.

Whenever
possible
to
examine
,
signs
of
active
disease
were
not
present
,
supporting
the
hypothesis
that
the
parvovirus
vp2
gene
fragments
detected
by
real-time
PCR
possibly
correspond
to
viral
DNA
reminiscent
from
previous
infections
.

The
molecular
characterization
of
viruses
,
based
on
the
analysis
of
the
complete
or
partial
sequence
of
the
vp2
gene
,
allowed
typifying
three
viral
strains
of
mongoose
and
four
red
fox
's
as
feline
panleukopenia
virus
(
FPLV
)
and
one
stone
marten
's
as
newCPV-2b
type
.

The
genetic
similarity
found
between
the
FPLV
viruses
from
free-ranging
and
captive
wild
species
originated
in
Portugal
and
publicly
available
comparable
sequences
,
suggests
a
closer
genetic
relatedness
among
FPLV
circulating
in
Portugal
.

Although
the
clinical
and
epidemiological
significance
of
infection
could
not
be
established
,
this
study
evidences
that
exposure
of
sympatric
wild
carnivores
to
parvovirus
is
common
and
geographically
widespread
,
potentially
carrying
a
risk
to
susceptible
populations
at
the
wildlife-domestic
interface
and
to
threatened
species
,
such
as
the
wildcat
(

)
and
the
critically
endangered

Conclusion
:
Guizhimahuanggebantang

the
influenza
A
virus
(

,
and
Xinjiaxiangruyin
demonstrated
a
clear
therapeutic
effect
in
damp

and
may
play
a
protective
role
against

through
downregulation
of

.

Antisense
molecules
do
not
readily
cross
cell
membranes
.

This
has
limited
the
use
of
antisense
to
systems
where
techniques
have
been
worked
out
to
introduce
the
molecules
into
cells
,
such
as
embryos
and
cell
cultures
.

Uncharged
antisense
bearing
a
group
of
guanidinium
moieties
on
either
a
linear
peptide
or
dendrimer
scaffold
can
enter
cells
by
endocytosis
and
subsequently
escape
from
endosomes
into
the
cytosol/nuclear
compartment
of
cells
.

These
technologies
allow
systemic
administration
of
antisense
,
making
gene
knockdowns
and
splice
modification
feasible
in
adult
animals
;
this
review
presents
examples
of
such
animal
studies
.

with
PPMOs
,
which
are
an
arginine-rich
cell-penetrating
peptide
linked

oligo
,
can
also
be
performed
using
commercially
available

,
which
are
eight
guanidinium
groups
on
a

Antisense-based
techniques
such
as
blocking
translation
,
modifying
pre-mRNA
splicing
,
inhibiting
miRNA
maturation
and
inhibiting
viral

can
be
conveniently
applied
in
adult
animals
by
injecting
PPMOs

Vivo-Morpholinos
.

Background
:
In
many
studies
,
some
information
might
not
be
available
for
the
whole
cohort
,
some
covariates
,
or
even
the
outcome
,
might
be
ascertained
in
selected
subsamples
.

These
studies
are
part
of
a
broad
category
termed
two-phase
studies
.

Common
examples
include
the
nested
case-control
and
the
case-cohort
designs
.

For
two-phase
studies
,
appropriate
weighted
survival
estimates
have
been
derived
;
however
,
no
estimator
of
cumulative
incidence
accounting
for
competing
events
has
been
proposed
.

This
is
relevant
in
the
presence
of
multiple
types
of
events
,
where
estimation
of
event
type
specific
quantities
are
needed
for
evaluating
outcome
.

Methods
:
We
develop
a
non
parametric
estimator
of
the
cumulative
incidence
function
of
events
accounting
for
possible
competing
events
.

It
handles
a
general
sampling
design
by
weights
derived
from
the
sampling
probabilities
.

The
variance
is
derived
from
the
influence
function
of
the
subdistribution
hazard
.

Results
:
The
proposed
method
shows
good
performance
in
simulations
.

It
is
applied
to
estimate
the
crude
incidence
of
relapse
in
childhood
acute
lymphoblastic
leukemia
in
groups
defined
by
a
genotype
not
available
for
everyone
in
a
cohort
of
nearly
2000
patients
,
where
death
due
to
toxicity
acted
as
a
competing
event
.

In
a
second
example
the
aim
was
to
estimate
engagement
in
care
of
a
cohort
of
HIV
patients
in
resource
limited
setting
,
where
for
some
patients
the
outcome
itself
was
missing
due
to
lost
to
follow-up
.

A
sampling
based
approach
was
used
to
identify
outcome
in
a
subsample
of
lost
patients
and
to
obtain
a
valid
estimate
of
connection
to
care
.

Conclusions
:
A
valid
estimator
for
cumulative
incidence
of
events
accounting
for
competing
risks
under
a
general
sampling
design
from
an
infinite
target
population
is
derived
.

showed
that
approximately
25

Background
:
On
the
base
of
our
previous
study
we
were
observed
relevant
studies
on
the
hypothesis
that
the
antiviral
activity
of
quercetin
7-rhamnoside
(
Q7R
)
,
a
flavonoid
,
wo
n't
relate
ability
of
its
antioxidant
.

We
were
investigated
the
effects
of
Q7R
on
the
cytopathic
effects
(
CPE
)
by
CPE
reduction
assay
.

Production
of
DNA
fragment
and
reactive
oxygen
species
(
ROS
)
induced
by
PEDV
infection
were
studied
using
DNA
fragmentation
assay
and
flow
cytometry
.

Results
:
In
the
course
of
this
study
it
was
discovered
that
Q7R
is
an
extremely
potent
compound
against
PEDV
.

The
addition
of
Q7R
to
PEDV-infected
Vero
cells
directly
reduced
the
formation
of
a
visible
cytopathic
effect
(
CPE
)
.

Also
,
Q7R
did
not
induce
DNA
fragmentation
.

Furthermore
,
ROS
increased
the
infection
of
PEDV
,
which
was
strongly
decreased
by
N-acetyl-L-cysteins
(
NAC
)
.

However
,
the
increased
ROS
was
not
decreased
by
Q7R
.

Antiviral
activity
of
antioxidants
such
as
NAC
,
pyrrolidine
dithiocarbamate
(
PDTC
)
,
and
the
vitamin
E
derivative
,
trolox
,
were
hardly
noticed
.

We
concluded
that
the
inhibition
of
PEDV
production
by
Q7R
is
not
simply
due
to
a
general
action
as
an
antioxidants
and
is
highly
specific
,
as
several
other
antioxidants
(
NAC
,
PDTC
,
trolox
)
are
inactive
against
PEDV
infection
.

Hepatitis
A
was
designated
as
notifiable
infectious
disease
in
2011
.

Four
to
five
thousand
patients
were
reported
each
year
in
The
2019
hepatitis
A
outbreak
has
become
increasingly
prevalent
among
adults
in
Korea
and
is
the
largest
outbreak
since
that
in
2009-2010
.

The
incidence
in
the
current
outbreak
is
highest
among
adults
aged
35-44
years
,
corresponding
to
the
peak
incidence
among
those
aged
25-34
years
10
years
ago
.

This
may
indicate
a
cohort
effect
in
the
corresponding
age
group
.

Causes
of
these
repeated
outbreaks
of
hepatitis
A
in
Korea
are
low
level
of
immunity
among
adults
,
Korean
food
culture
that
consumes
raw
seafood
such
as
salted
clam
and
inadequate
public
health
system
.

Among
countermeasures
,
along
with
general
infectious
disease
control
measures
including
control
of
the
infectious
agent
,
infection
spread
,
and

,
urgent

are
needed

Canine
influenza
virus
(
CIV
)
subtype
H3N2
is
a
newly
identified
,
highly
contagious
respiratory
pathogen
that
causes
cough
,
pneumonia
and
other
respiratory
symptoms
in
dogs
.

Data
indicate
that
the
virus
is
responsible
for
recent
clinical
cases
of
dog
disease
in
China
.

However
,
therapeutic
options
for
this
disease
are
very
limited
.

In
this
study
,
seven
monoclonal
antibodies
(
mAbs
)
against
CIV
JS/10
(
an
H3N2
subtype
virus
)
were
produced
and
characterized
.

Among
them
,
mAb
D7
,
which
is
specific
for
the
HA2
glycopeptide
(
gp
)
,
induced
the
highest
neutralization
titers
.

The
protection
provided
by
mAb
D7
was
evaluated
in
BALB/c
mice
challenged
with
homologous
or
heterologous
strains
of
H3N2
influenza
virus
,
including
two
strains
of
CIV
and
one
strain
of
swine
influenza
virus
(
SIV
)
.

The
data
show
that
mAb
D7
protected
the
mice
from
infection
with
the
three
viral
strains
,
especially
the
homologous
strain
,
which
was
indicated
by
the
recovery
of
body
weight
,
reduction
of
viral
load
,
and
reduction
of
tissue
damage
.

Moreover
,
the
levels
of
IFN-γ
and
TNF-α
in
the
lungs
,
as
detected
by
ELISA
,
were
reduced
in
the
infected
mice
treated
with
the
mAb
D7
compared
with
those
without
mAb
D7
treatment
.

Thus
,
our
findings
demonstrate
,
for
the
first
time
,
that
a
mAb
could
reduce
the
release
of
IFN-γ
and
TNF-α
associated
with
tissue
damage
by
CIV

Objective
:
To
report
a
case
of
a
patient
who
required
tracheal
intubation
in
a
pediatric
emergency
department
due
to
acute
laryngitis
and
that
,
after
the
planned
extubation
,
has
successfully
used
the
high-flow
nasal
cannula
,
which
possibly
prevented
extubation
failure
.

Case
description
:
A
male
8-month-old
child
was
admitted
to
the
pediatric
emergency
room
with
acute
respiratory
distress
due
to
a
high
airway
obstruction
secondary
to
severe
acute
laryngitis
.

He
was
immediately
intubated
and
referred
to
the
pediatric
intensive
care
unit
.

He
presented
extubation
failure
due
to
a
significant
laryngeal
edema
evidenced
by
bronchoscopy
.

In
the
second
attempt
to
extubate
,
he
presented
respiratory
distress
,
but
,
after
the
use
of
the
high-flow
nasal
cannula
,
he
became
stable
,
reducing
the
heart
and
respiratory
frequencies
,
and
the
extubation
was
successful
.

Comments
:
The
use
of
the
high-flow
nasal
cannula
was
effective
and
presented
good
response
in
this
patient
with
acute
laryngitis
,
suggesting
that
it
is
a
possible
adjuvant
for
the
treatment
,
avoiding
worsening
respiratory
conditions
and
the
need
for
reintubation

Background
:
Diagnosis
of
community-acquired
pneumonia
(
CAP
)
caused
by
Mycoplasma
pneumoniae
in
adults
and
adolescents
is
hampered
by
a
lack
of
rapid
and
standardized
tests
for
detection
.

Methods
:
CAP
patients
from
12
teaching
hospitals
were
prospectively
and
consecutively
recruited
.

Basic
and
clinical
information
,
throat
swabs
and
paired
sera
were
collected
.

Mycoplasma
pneumoniae
was
detected
by
IgG
and
IgM
antibody
tests
,
fluorescence
quantitative
polymerase
chain
reaction
(
FQ-PCR
)
and
culture
.

A
comparative
study
of
the
diagnostic
values
of
three
methods
,
including
sensitivity
,
specificity
,
positive
and
negative
predictive
values
and
positive
likelihood
ratio
(
PLR
)
was
conducted
.

A
fourfold
or
greater
increase
of
IgG
antibody
titers
of
paired
sera
was
set
as
the
diagnostic
``
gold
standard
''
.

Results
:
One
hundred
and
twenty-five
CAP
patients
(
52.8
%
males
,
median
age
47
years
,
range
14-85
)
were
enrolled
.

Twenty-seven
(
21.6
%
)
patients
were
diagnosed
with
acute
Mycoplasma
pneumoniae
infections
by
the
``
gold
standard
''
.

Specificity
values
of
all
three
methods
were
around
90
%
.

An
increasing
trend
of
sensitivity
,
positive
predictive
value
and
PLR
was
found
,
with
the
lowest
in
IgM
testing
(
7.4
%
,
28.6
%
and
1.45
)
,
intermediate
in
FQ-PCR
(
40.7
%
,
50
%
and
3.63
)
,
and
highest
in
culture
(
55.6
%
,
75
%
and
10.9
)
.

Conclusions
:
In
the
defined
group
of
patients
,
there
was
a
good
agreement
between
positive
rate
of
MP
cultivation
of
throat
swabs
and
acute
M.
pneumoniae
infection
(
PLR
of
10.9
)
.

Since
the
sensitivity
is
low
in
all
of
the
evaluated
methods
,
the
logical
approach
would
be
to
incorporate
PCR
,
culture
and
serological
tests
for
optimum
diagnosis
of
acute
Mycoplasma
pneumoniae
infections
in

and
adolescents

Here
we
report
that
acquisition
of
the
cell-cell
fusion
activity
by
amino
acid
mutations
in
the
S
protein
determines
the
infectivity
of
IBV
in
cultured
cells
.

Expression
of
S
protein
derived
from
Vero-and
CK-adapted
strains
showed
efficient
induction
of
membrane
fusion
.

However
,
expression
of
S
protein
cloned
from
the
third
passage
of
IBV
in
chicken
embryo
(
EP3
)
did
not
show
apparent
syncytia
formation
.

By
construction
of
chimeric
S
constructs
and
site-directed
mutagenesis
,
a
point
mutation
(
L857-F
)
at
amino
acid
position
857
in
the
heptad
repeat
1
region
of
S
protein
was
shown
to
be
responsible
for
its
acquisition
of
the
cell-cell
fusion
activity
.

Furthermore
,
a
G405-D
point
mutation
in
the
S1
domain
,
which
was
acquired
during
further
propagation
of
Vero-adapted
IBV
in
Vero
cells
,
could
enhance
the
cell-cell
fusion
activity
of
the
protein
.

Re-introduction
of
L857
back
to
the
S
gene
of
Vero-adapted
IBV
allowed
recovery
of
variants
that
contain
the
introduced
L857
.

However
,
compensatory
mutations
in
S1
and
some
distant
regions
of
S2
were
required
for
restoration
of
the
cell-cell
fusion
activity
of
S
protein
carrying
L857
and
for
the
infectivity
of
the
recovered
variants
in
cultured
cells
.

This
study
demonstrates
that
acquisition
of
the
cell-cell
fusion
activity
in
S
protein
determines
the
selection
and/or
adaptation
of
a
coronavirus
from
chicken

to
cultured

Although
it
has
been
more
than
40
years
since
``

presented
as
a

in
the
Alma

declaration
[

,
the
world
is
still
far
from
achieving
this
goal
.

Although
great
progress
has
been
made
since
then
in
many
areas
of
health
,
much
of
that
progress
has
been
confined
to
rich
countries
,
and
even
within
the
richest
of
countries
,
health
inequality
persists
.

New
health
problems
and
threats
have
arisen
in
the
generations
since
that
hopeful
statement
,
with
the
scourge
of
HIV
and
the
challenge
of
non-communicable
diseases
(
NCDs
)
facing
high
and
low-income
countries
alike
[

]
.

With
these
new
challenges
,
we
see
inequalities
forming
along
the
same
old
social
fault
lines
and
the
same
axes
of
deprivation
and
discrimination
.

In
high-income
countries
,
new
risk
factors
such
as
obesity
and
food
insecurity
cluster
in
the
poorest
communities
[
3,4
]
,
while
on
a
global
level
,
we
see
the
greatest
burden
of
new
diseases
such
as
HIV
falling
on
the
poorest
countries
[

,
and
continuing
challenges
of
health
access
and
financing
for
the
poorest
people
[

.

Much
of
this
inequality
arises
from
simple
economic
inequality
and
the
consequences
of
colonialism
,
but
much
also
results
from
the
marginalization
of
certain
individuals

groups

national
and
global

Discrimination
against
some
members
of
the
community
,
their
exclusion
from
economic
,
cultural
and
social
processes
,
and
the
selective
provision
of
basic
services
to
these

put
them
at
increased
risk
of
poor
health
and
expose
them
to
preventable
risk
factors
.

Because
the
marginalization
of
these
people
is
socially
and
historically
determined
,
the
health
consequences
for
these
people
continue
to
be
severe

pernicious

despite
being
preventable
.

In
this
Special
Issue
on
the
health
of
marginalized
people
,
we
have
gathered
15
papers
from
many
countries
,
describing
a
wide
range
of
physical
and
mental
health
issues

a
variety
of
advanced
research

to
understand
the
health
challenges
faced
by
a
diverse
array
of
marginalized
populations
globally
,
and
recommending
interventions
to
improve
the
health
of
marginalized

First
,
we
summarize
the
research
articles
presented
in
this
Special
Issue
and
then
issue
a
call
for
renewed
action
to
end
discrimination
and
marginalization
in
our
societies
,
and
to
strengthen
wider
efforts
to
support
the
health
of
the
most
marginalized
people
.

Mental
health
and

are
significant
issues
among

Apoptosis
plays
an
important
role
in
the
pathogenesis
of
viral
infections
.

In
this
study
,
we
investigated
the
cell
death
processes
during
productive
HHV-6A
infection
and
the
underlying
mechanisms
.

Annexin
V-PI
staining
and
electron
microscopy
indicated
that
HHV-6A
is
a
strong
inducer
of
apoptosis
.

HHV-6A
infection
decreased
mitochondrial
transmembrane
potential
and
led
to
morphological
changes
of
mitochondria
.

The
cell
death
was
associated
with
activation
of
caspase-3
and
cleavage
of
DNA
repair
enzyme
poly
(
ADP-ribose
)
polymerase
,
which
is
known
to
be
an
important
substrate
for
activated
caspase-3
.

Caspase-9
was
activated
significantly
in
HHV-6Ainfected
cells
,
whereas
caspase-8
was
not
activated
obviously
.

Moreover
,
HHV-6A
infection
upregulated
Bax
and
downregulated
Bcl-2
.

This
is
the
first
demonstration
of
mitochondrion-mediated
,
caspase-dependent
apoptosis
in
HHV-6A-infected
cells
.

Background
:
La
Crosse
virus
(
LACV
)
,
family
Bunyaviridae
,
was
first
identified
as
a
human
pathogen
in
1960
after
its
isolation
from
a
4
year-old
girl
with
fatal
encephalitis
in
La
Crosse
,
Wisconsin
.

LACV
is
a
major
cause
of
pediatric
encephalitis
in
North
America
and
infects
up
to
300,000
persons
each
year
of
which
70-130
result
in
severe
disease
of
the
central
nervous
system
(
CNS
)
.

As
an
initial
step
in
the
establishment
of
useful
animal
models
to
support
vaccine
development
,
we
examined
LACV
infectivity
,
pathogenesis
,
and
immunogenicity
in
both
weanling
mice
and
rhesus
monkeys
.

Following
intraperitoneal
inoculation
of
mice
,
LACV
replicated
in
various
organs
before
reaching
the
CNS
where
it
replicates
to
high
titer
causing
death
from
neurological
disease
.

The
peripheral
site
where
LACV
replicates
to
highest
titer
is
the
nasal
turbinates
,
and
,
presumably
,
LACV
can
enter
the
CNS
via
the
olfactory
neurons
from
nasal
olfactory
epithelium
.

The
mouse
infectious
dose
50
and
lethal
dose
50
was
similar
for
LACV
administered
either
intranasally
or
intraperitoneally
.

LACV
was
highly
infectious
for
rhesus
monkeys
and
infected
100
%
of
the
animals
at
10
PFU
.

However
,
the
infection
was
asymptomatic
,
and
the
monkeys
developed
a
strong
neutralizing
antibody
response
.

In
mice
,
LACV
likely
gains
access
to
the
CNS
via
the
blood
stream
or
via
olfactory
neurons
.

The
ability
to
efficiently
infect
mice
intranasally
raises
the
possibility
that
LACV
might
use
this
route
to
infect
its
natural
hosts
.

Rhesus
monkeys
are
susceptible
to
LACV
infection
and
develop
strong
neutralizing
antibody
responses
after
inoculation
with
as
little
as
10
PFU
.

Mice
and
rhesus
monkeys
are
useful
animal
models
for
LACV
vaccine
immunologic
testing
although
the
rhesus
monkey
model
is
not
optimal
.

Otitis
media
(
OM
)
is
amongst
the
most
common
childhood
diseases
and
is
associated
with
multiple
microbial
pathogens
within
the
middle
ear
.

Global
and
temporal
monitoring
of
predominant
bacterial
pathogens
is
important
to
inform
new
treatment
strategies
,
vaccine
development
and
to
monitor
the
impact
of
vaccine
implementation
to
improve
progress
toward
global
OM
prevention
.

A
systematic
review
of
published
reports
of
microbiology
of
acute
otitis
media
(
AOM
)
and
otitis
media
with

from
January
,
1970
to
August
2014
,
was
performed
using
PubMed
databases
.

This
review
confirmed
that
Streptococcus
pneumoniae
and
Haemophilus
influenzae
,
remain
the
predominant
bacterial
pathogens
,
with
S.
pneumoniae
the
predominant
bacterium
in
the
majority
reports
from
AOM
patients
.

In
contrast
,
H.
influenzae

the
predominant
bacterium
for
patients
experiencing
chronic
OME
,
recurrent
AOM
and
AOM
with
treatment
failure
.

This
result
was
consistent
,
even
where
improved
detection
sensitivity
from
the
use
of
polymerase
chain
reaction
(
PCR
)
rather
than
bacterial
culture
was
conducted
.

On
average
,
PCR
analyses
increased
the
frequency
of
detection
of
S.
pneumoniae
and
H.
influenzae
3.2
fold
compared
to
culture
,
whilst
Moraxella
catarrhalis
was
4.5
times
more
frequently
identified
by
PCR
.

Molecular
methods
can
also
improve
monitoring
of
regional
changes
in
the
serotypes
and
identification
frequency
of
S.
pneumoniae
and
H.

over
time

implementation

as
after

Acute
Respiratory
Infections
(
ARI
)
are
some
of
the
most
common
human
diseases
worldwide
.

However
,
they
have
a
complex
and
diverse
etiology
,
and
the
characteristics
of
the
pathogens
involved
in
respiratory
infections
in
developing
countries
are
not
well
understood
.

In
this
work
,
we
analyzed
the
characteristics
of
17
common
respiratory
pathogens
in
children
(
#
14
years
old
)
with
ARI
in
Guangzhou
,
southern
China
over
a
3-year
period
using
real-time
polymerase
chain
reaction
.

Pathogens
were
identified
in
2361/4242
(
55.7
%
)
patients
,
and
the
positivity
rate
varied
seasonally
.

Ten
of
the
17
pathogens
investigated
showed
positivity
rates
of
more
than
5
%
.

The
most
frequently
detected
pathogens
were
respiratory
syncytial
virus
(
768/2361
,
32.5
%
)
,
influenza
A
virus
(
428/2361
,
18.1
%
)
,
enterovirus
(
138/2361
,
13.3
%
)
,
Mycoplasma
pneumoniae
(
267/2361
,
11.3
%
)
and
adenovirus
(
213/2361
,
9.0
%
)
.

Co-pathogens
were
common
and
found
in
503
of
2361
(
21.3
%
)
positive
samples
.

When
ranked
according
to
frequency
of
occurrence
,
the
pattern
of
co-pathogens
was
similar
to
that
of
the
primary
pathogens
,
with
the
exception
of
human
bocavirus
,
human
coronavirus
and
human
metapneumovirus
.

Significant
differences
were
found
in
age
prevalence
in
10
of
the
17
pathogens
(
p
#
0.009
)
:
four
basic
patterns
were
observed
,
A
:
detection
rates
increased
with
age
,
B
:
detection
rates
declined
with
age
,
C
:
the
detection
rate
showed
distinct
peaks
or
D
:
numbers
of
patients
were
too
low
to
detect
a
trend
or
showed
no
significant
difference
among
age
groups
(
p.
0.05
)
.

These
data
will
be
useful
for
planning
vaccine
research
and
control
strategies
and
for
studies
predicting
pathogen
prevalence

Balkan
endemic
nephropathy
(
BEN
)
is
a
familial
chronic
tubulointerstitial
disease
with
insidious
onset
and
slow
progression
leading
to
terminal
renal
failure
.

The
results
of
molecular
biological
investigations
propose
that
BEN
is
a
multifactorial
disease
with
genetic
predisposition
to
environmental
risk
agents
.

Exome
sequencing
of
22

genes
with
Illumina

Enrichment
Kit
was
performed
on
22
DNA
samples
(
11
Bulgarian
patients
and
11
Serbian
patients
)
.

Software
analysis
was
performed
via
NextGene
,

,
and
PolyPhen
.

The
frequency
of
all
annotated
genetic
variants
with
deleterious/damaging
effect
was
compared
with
those
of
European
populations
.

Then
we
focused
on
nonannotated
variants
(
with
no
data
available
about
them
and
not
found
in
healthy
Bulgarian
controls
)
.

There
is
no
statistically
significant
difference
between
annotated
variants
in
BEN
patients
and
European
populations
.

From
nonannotated
variants
with
more
than
40
%
frequency
in
both
patients
'
groups
,
we
nominated
3
genes
with
possible
deleterious/damaging
variants-CELA1
,
HSPG2
,
and
KCNK5
.

Mutant
genes
(
CELA1
,
HSPG2
,
and
KCNK5
)
in
BEN
patients
encode
proteins
involved
in
basement
membrane/extracellular
matrix
and
vascular
tone
,
tightly
connected
to
process
of
angiogenesis
.

We
suggest
that
an
abnormal
process
of
angiogenesis
plays
a
key
role
in
the
molecular
pathogenesis
of
BEN
.

The
flavivirus
genus
includes
viruses
with
a
remarkable
ability
to
produce
disease
on
a
large
scale
.

The
expansion
and
increased
endemicity
of
dengue
and
West
Nile
viruses
in
the
Americas
exemplifies
their
medical
and
epidemiological
importance
.

The
rapid
detection
of
viral
infection
and
induction
of
the
innate
antiviral
response
are
crucial
to
determining
the
outcome
of
infection
.

The
intracellular
pathogen
receptors
RIG-I
and
MDA5
play
a
central
role
in
detecting
flavivirus
infections
and
initiating
a
robust
antiviral
response
.

Yet
,
these
viruses
are
still
capable
of
producing
acute
illness
in
humans
.

It
is
now
clear
that
flaviviruses
utilize
a
variety
of
mechanisms
to
modulate
the
interferon
response
.

The
non-structural
proteins
of
the
various
flaviviruses
reduce
expression
of
interferon
dependent
genes
by
blocking
phosphorylation
,
enhancing
degradation
or
down-regulating
expression
of
major
components
of
the
JAK/STAT
pathway
.

Recent
studies
indicate
that
interferon
modulation
is
an
important
factor
in
the
development
of
severe
flaviviral
illness
.

This
suggests
that
an
increased
understanding
of
viral-host
interactions
will
facilitate
the
development
of
novel
therapeutics
to
treat
these
viral
infections
and
improved
biological
models
to
study
flavivirus
pathogenesis
.

Background
:
While
,
lost
to
follow-up
(
LTFU
)
from
antiretroviral
therapy
(
ART
)
can
be
considered
a
catch-all
category
for
patients
who
miss
scheduled
visits
or
medication
pick-ups
,
operational
definitions
and
methods
for
defining
LTFU
vary
making
comparisons
across
programs
challenging
.

Using
weekly
cut-offs
,
we
sought
to
determine
the
probability
that
an
individual
would
return
to
clinic
given
that
they
had
not
yet
returned
in
order
to
identify
the
LTFU
cut-off
that
could
be
used
to
inform
clinical
management
and
tracing
procedures
.

Methods
:
Individuals
who
initiated
ART
with
Dignitas
International
supported
sites
(
n
=
22
)
in
Zomba
,
Malawi
between
January
1
2007-June
30
2010
and
were
≥
1
week
late
for
a
follow-up
visit
were
included
.

Lateness
was
categorized
using
weekly
cut-offs
from
≥1
to
≥26
weeks
late
.

At
each
weekly
cut-off
,
the
proportion
of
patients
who
returned
for
a
subsequent
follow-up
visit
were
identified
.

Cumulative
Distribution
Functions
(
CDFs
)
were
plotted
to
determine
the
probability
of
returning
as
a
function
of
lateness
.

Hazard
functions
were
plotted
to
demonstrate
the
proportion
of
patients
who
returned
each
weekly
interval
relative
to
those
who
had
yet
to
return
.

Results
:
In
total
,
n
=
4484
patients
with
n
=
7316
follow-up
visits
were
included
.

The
number
of
included
follow-up
visits
per
patient
ranged
from
1-10
(
median
:
1
)
.

Both
the
CDF
and
hazard
function
demonstrated
that
after
being
≥9
weeks
late
,
the
proportion
of
new
patients
who
returned
relative
to
those
who
had
yet
to
return
decreased
substantially
.

Conclusions
:
We
identified
a
LTFU
definition
useful
for
clinical
management
.

The
simple
functions
plotted
here
did
not
require
advanced
statistical
expertise
and
were
created
using
Microsoft
Excel
,
making
it
a
particularly
practical
method
for
HIV
programs
in
resource-constrained
settings
.

A
SARS-CoV
lacking
the
full-length
E
gene
(
SARS-CoV-ΔE
)
was
attenuated
and
an
effective
vaccine
.

Here
,
we
show
that
this
mutant
virus
regained
fitness
after
serial
passages
in
cell
culture
or
in
vivo
,
resulting
in
the
partial
duplication
of
the
membrane
gene
or
in
the
insertion
of
a
new
sequence
in
gene
8a
,
respectively
.

The
chimeric
proteins
generated
in
cell
culture
increased
virus
fitness
in
vitro
but
remained
attenuated
in
mice
.

In
contrast
,
during
SARS-CoV-ΔE
passage
in
mice
,
the
virus
incorporated
a
mutated
variant
of
8a
protein
,
resulting
in
reversion
to
a
virulent
phenotype
.

When
the
full-length
E
protein
was
deleted
or
its
PDZ-binding
motif
(
PBM
)
was
mutated
,
the
revertant
viruses
either
incorporated
a
novel
chimeric
protein
with
a
PBM
or
restored
the
sequence
of
the
PBM
on
the
E
protein
,
respectively
.

Similarly
,
after
passage
in
mice
,
SARS-CoV-ΔE
protein
8a
mutated
,
to
now
encode
a
PBM
,
and
also
regained
virulence
.

These
data
indicated
that
the
virus
requires
a
PBM
on
a
transmembrane
protein
to
compensate
for
removal
of
this
motif
from
the
E
protein
.

To
increase
the
genetic
stability
of
the
vaccine
candidate
,
we
introduced
small
attenuating
deletions
in
E
gene
that
did
not
affect
the
endogenous
PBM
,
preventing
the
incorporation
of
novel
chimeric
proteins
in
the
virus
genome
.

In
addition
,
to
increase
vaccine
biosafety
,
we
introduced
additional
attenuating
mutations
into
the
nsp1
protein
.

Deletions
in
the
carboxyterminal
region
of
nsp1
protein
led
to
higher
host
interferon
responses
and
virus
attenuation
.

Recombinant
viruses
including
attenuating
mutations
in
E
and
nsp1
genes
maintained
their
attenuation
after
passage
in
vitro
and
in
vivo
.

Further
,
these
viruses
fully
protected
mice
against
challenge
with
the
lethal
parental
virus
,
and
are
therefore
safe
and
stable
vaccine
candidates
for
protection
against
SARS-CoV
.

Bats
are
rich
reservoir
hosts
for
a
variety
of
viruses
,
many
of
which
are
capable
of
spillover
to
other
susceptible
mammals
with
lethal
consequences
.

The
ability
of
bats
to
remain
asymptomatic
to
viral
infection
may
be
due
to
the
rapid
control
of
viral
replication
very
early
in
the
immune
response
through
innate
antiviral
mechanisms
.

Type
I
and
III
interferons
(
IFNs
)
represent
the
first
line
of
defence
against
viral
infection
in
mammals
,
with
both
families
of
IFNs
present
in
pteropid
bats
.

To
obtain
further
insight
into
the
type
III
IFN
system
in
bats
,
we
describe
the
characterization
of
the
type
III
IFN
receptor
(
IFNlR
)
in
the
black
flying
fox
,
P.
alecto
with
the
characterization
of
IFNlR1
and
IL10R2
genes
that
make
up
the
type
III
IFN
receptor
complex
.

The
bat
IFNlR
complex
has
a
wide
tissue
distribution
and
at
the
cellular
level
,
both
epithelial
and
immune
cells
are
responsive
to
IFN-l
treatment
.

Furthermore
,
we
demonstrate
that
the
bat
IFNlR1
chain
acts
as
a
functional
receptor
.

To
our
knowledge
,
this
report
represents
the
first
description
of
an
IFN
receptor
in
any
species
of
bat
.

The
responsiveness
of
bat
cells
to
IFN-l
support
a
role
for
the
type
III
IFN
system

in

Herpes
simplex
virus-1
(
HSV-1
)
infection
causes
severe
conditions
,
with
serious
complications
,
including
corneal
blindness
from
uncontrolled
ocular
infections
.

An
important
cellular
defense
mechanism
against
HSV-1
infection
is
autophagy
.

The
autophagic
response
of
the
host
cell
was
suggested
to
be
regulated
by
HSV-1
.

In
this
study
,
we
performed
a
detailed
analysis
of
autophagy
in
multiple
HSV-1-targeted
cell
types
,
and
under
various
infection
conditions
that
recapitulate
a
productive
infection
model
.

We
found
that
autophagy
was
slightly
inhibited
in
one
cell
type
,
while
in
other
cell
types
autophagy
maintained
its
basal
levels
mostly
unchanged
during
productive
infection
.

This
study
refines
the
concept
of
HSV-1mediated
autophagy
regulation
to
imply
either
inhibition
,
or
prevention
of
activation
,
of
the
innate
immune
pathway
.

,
the
active
isoform
of
X-box
binding
protein
1
(
XBP-1
)
,
is
a
key
regulator
of
UPR
.

Previously
,
we
showed
that
a
histone
acetyltransferase
(
HAT
)
,
p300/CBP-associated
factor
(
PCAF
)
,
binds
to
XBP-1S
and
functions
as
an
activator
of
XBP-1S
.

Here
,
we
identify
general
control
nonderepressible
5
(
GCN5
)
,
a
HAT
with
73
%
identity
to
PCAF
,
as
a
novel
XBP-1S
regulator
.

Both
PCAF
and
GCN5
bind
to
the
same
domain
of
XBP-1S
.

Surprisingly
,
GCN5
potently
blocks
the
XBP-1Smediated
transcription
,
including
cellular
UPR
genes
and
latent
membrane
protein
1
of
Epstein-Barr
virus
.

Unlike
PCAF
,
GCN5
acetylates
XBP-1S
and
enhances
nuclear
retention
and
protein
stability
of
XBP-1S
.

However
,
such
GCN5-mediated
acetylation
of
XBP-1S
shows
no
effects
on
XBP-1S
activity
.

In
addition
,
the
HAT
activity
of
GCN5
is
not
required
for
repression
of
XBP-1S
target
genes
.

We
further
demonstrate
that
GCN5
inhibits
XBP-1S-mediated
transcription
by
disrupting
the
PCAF-XBP-1S
interaction
and
preventing
the
recruitment
of
XBP-1S
to
its
target
genes
.

Taken
together
,
our
results
represent
the
first
work
demonstrating
that
GCN5
and
PCAF
exhibit
different
functions
and
antagonistically
regulate
the
XBP-1S-mediated
transcription

Wild
poliovirus
(
WPV
)
persists
in
diverse
locales
worldwide
,
spreading
outward
from
endemic
areas
.

In
response
to
the
international
threat
of
WPV
transmission
and
changes
in
the
national
vaccination
policy
,
we
established
an
environmental
surveillance
system
to
monitor
the
circulation
of
wild
and
vaccine-related
poliovirus
in
Taiwan
.

From
July
2012
to
December
2013
,
we
collected
sewage
specimens
every
month
from
10
sewage
treatment
plants
located
throughout
Taiwan
.

The
specimens
were
concentrated
by
the
two-phase
separation
method
and
then
inoculated
into
L20B
,
RD
,
and
A549
cells
for
virus
isolation
.

Viral
isolates
were
identified
and
serotyped
by
immunofluorescence
assay
or
molecular
analysis
.

A
total
of
300
sewage
samples
were
collected
,
and
the
results
showed
163
samples
(
54.3
%
)
were
positive
for
virus
,
and
268
isolates
were
identified
.

Among
these
,
75
samples
(
25
%
)
were
positive
for
enterovirus
(
EV
)
,
but
no
poliovirus
was
found
.

In
addition
,
92
isolates
were
identified
as
enteroviruses
and
the
most
common
serotypes
were
coxsackievirus
B4
,
coxsackievirus
B3
,
and
coxsackievirus
B2
.

Interestingly
,
102
(
34
%
)
and
82
(
27.3
%
)
specimens
were
positive
for
mammalian
orthoreovirus
(
MRV
)
and
adenovirus
,
respectively
.

This
study
confirmed
that
sewage
surveillance
can
be
a
useful
additional
modality
for
monitoring
the
possible
presence
of
wild-type
or
vaccine-derived
poliovirus
in
wastewater
,
and
can
indicate
the
current
types
of
viruses
circulating
in
the
population
.

Furthermore
,
since
MRV
was
found
in
children
with
acute
necrotizing
encephalopathy
and
meningitis
,
the
high
incidence
of
MRV
detected
by
environmental
surveillance
warrants
further
investigation
.

The
incidence
of
dengue
is
increasing
in
Guangdong
,
China
,
with
the
largest
outbreak
to
date
in
2014
.

Widespread
awareness
of
epidemiological
and
molecular
characteristics
of
the
dengue
virus
(
DENV
)
is
required
.

In
2014
,
we
isolated
the
virus
from
patients
and
sequenced
its
genome
.

The
sequences
of
DENV
isolated
from
Guangdong
and
other
countries
screened
since
2005
were
studied
to
establish
molecular
evolutionary
databases
along
with
epidemiological
data
to
explore
its
epidemiological
,
phylogenetic
,
and
molecular
characteristics
.

Causes
underlying
the
occurrence
of
the
dengue
epidemic
included
importation
and
localization
of
the
virus
.

The
number
of
indigenous
cases
significantly
exceeded
that
of
imported
cases
.

Dengue
virus
1
is
the
most
important
serotype
and
caused
the
long-term
epidemic
locally
.

Based
on
the
data
available
since
2005
,
DENV1
was
divided
into
three
genotypes
(
I
,
IV
,
and
V
)
.

Only
genotypes
I
and
V
were
detected
in
2014
.

In
2014
,
an
epidemic
involving
old
lineages
of
DENV1
genotype
V
occurred
after
2
years
of
silence
.

The
genotype
was
previously
detected
from
2009
to
2011
.

Genotype
I
,
which
caused
recent
epidemics
,
demonstrated
a
continuation
of
new
lineages
,
and
a
predictive
pattern
of
molecular
evolution
since
2005
among
the
four
lineages
was
present
.

The
DENV
isolated
from
Guangdong
was
closely
related
to
those
causing
large-scale
epidemics
in
neighboring
countries
,
suggesting
the
possibility
of
its
import
from
these
countries
.

The
lack
of
sufficient
epidemiological
data
and
evidence
on
the
local
mosquito-borne
DENV
emphasizes
the
importance
of
studying
the
molecular
evolutionary
features
and
establishing
a
well-established
phylogenetic
tree
for
dengue
prevention
and
control
in
Guangdong
.

Highly
homologous
sequences
154-157
bp
in
length
grouped
under
the
name
of
``
conserved
non-protein-coding
element
''
(
CNE
)
were
revealed
in
all
of
the
sequenced
genomes
of
baculoviruses
belonging
to
the
genus
Alphabaculovirus
.

A
CNE
alignment
led
to
the
detection
of
a
set
of
highly
conserved
nucleotide
clusters
that
occupy
strictly
conserved
positions
in
the
CNE
sequence
.

The
significant
length
of
the
CNE
and
conservation
of
both
its
length
and
cluster
architecture
were
identified
as
a
combination
of
characteristics
that
make
this
CNE
different
from
known
viral
non-coding
functional
sequences
.

The
essential
role
of
the
CNE
in
the
Alphabaculovirus
life
cycle
was
demonstrated
through
the
use
of
a
CNEknockout
Autographa
californica
multiple
nucleopolyhedrovirus
(
AcMNPV
)
bacmid
.

It
was
shown
that
the
essential
function
of
the
CNE
was
not
mediated
by
the
presumed
expression
activities
of
the
protein-and
non-protein-coding
genes
that
overlap
the
AcMNPV
CNE
.

On
the
basis
of
the
presented
data
,
the
AcMNPV
CNE
was
categorized
as
a
complex-structured
,
polyfunctional
genomic
element
involved
in
an
essential
DNA
transaction
that
is
associated
with
an
undefined
function
of
the
baculovirus
genome

surfaced
in

Throughout

periods
of
heightened
neuroplasticity
are
critical
for
the
development

behavior
.

Given
the
high
prevalence
of
neurodevelopmental
disorders
,
such
as
autism
,
identifying
disruptors
of
developmental

represents
an

developing
strategies

During
childhood

,
heightened
neuroplasticity
allows
the
brain
to
reorganize
and
adapt
to
its

.

Disruptions
in
these
malleable

result
in

To
identify
pathological
mechanisms
that
disrupt
developmental

,
we
applied
a
systematic
computational
screen
of
hundreds
of
diseases
for
their
impact
on
neuroplasticity
.

We
discovered

Japanese
encephalitis
virus
infection
is
currently
available
.

Repurposing
of
approved
drugs
would
accelerate
the
development
of
a
therapeutic
stratagem
.

In
this
study
,
we
screened
a
library
of
FDAapproved
drugs
and
identified
five
hit
drugs
,
especially
calcium
inhibitors
,
exerting
antiflavivirus
activity
that
blocked
viral
replication
.

The
in
vivo
efficacy
and
toxicity
of
manidipine
were
investigated
with
a
mouse
model
of
JEV
infection
,
and
the
viral
target
was
identified
by
generating
an
adaptive
mutant
.

Background
:
Infectious
bovine
rhinotracheitis
virus
(
IBRV
)
is
a
major
pathogen
in
cattle
and
has
led
to
significant
economic
losses
to
the
dairy
industry
worldwide
,
and
therefore
a
more
optimal
method
for
the
rapid
diagnosis
of
IBRV
infection
is
highly
needed
.

In
this
study
,
we
described
the
development
of
a
lateral
flow
dipstrip
(
LFD
)
of
isothermal
recombinase
polymerase
amplification
(
RPA
)
method
for
rapid
detection
of
IBRV
.

Methods
:
Distinct
regions
were
selected
as
a
candidate
target
for
designing
the
LFD-RPA
primers
and
probes
.

The
analytical
sensitivity
of
the
RPA
assay
was
determined
using
ten-fold
serially
diluted
IBRV
DNA
.

The
specificity
of
the
assay
was
assessed
with
other
viral
pathogens
of
cattle
with
similar
clinic
and
other
herpesviruses
.

The
clinical
performance
was
evaluated
by
testing
106
acute-phase
high
fever
clinical
specimens
.

Results
:
RPA
primers
and
probe
were
designed
to
target
the
specific
conserved
UL52
region
fragment
of
IBRV
.

The
detection
could
be
completed
at
a
constant
temperature
of
38°C
for
25
min
,
and
the
amplification
products
were
easily
visualized
on
a
simple
LFD
.

The
detection
limit
of
this
assay
was
5
copies
per
reaction
of
IBRV
DNA
and
there
was
no
cross-reactivity
with
other
viruses
causing
bovine
gastrointestinal
and
respiratory
infections
or
other
herpesviruses
.

The
assay
performance
on
acute-phase
high
fever
clinical
samples
collected
from
cattle
with
no
vaccine
against
IBRV
,
which
were
suspected
to
be
infected
with
IBRV
,
was
validated
by
detecting
24
fecal
,
36
blood
,
38
nasal
swab
and
8
tissue
specimens
,
and
compared
with
SYBR
Green
I
based
real-time
PCR
.

The
coincidence
between
IBRV
LFD-RPA
and
real-time
PCR
was
100
%
.

Conclusion
:
IBRV
LFD-RPA
was
fast
and
much
easier
to
serve
as
an
alternative
to
the
common
measures
used
for
IBRV
diagnosis
,
as
there
is
reduction
in
the
use
of
instruments
for
identification
of
the
infected
animals
.

In
addition
,
this
assay
may
be
the
potential
candidate
to
be
used
as
point-of-care
diagnostics
in
the
field
.

Partetravirus
is
a
recently
described
group
of
animal
parvoviruses
which
include
the
human
partetravirus
,
bovine
partetravirus
and
porcine
partetravirus
(
previously
known
as
human
parvovirus
4
,
bovine
hokovirus
and
porcine
hokovirus
respectively
)
.

In
this
report
,
we
describe
the
discovery
and
genomic
characterization
of
partetraviruses
in
bovine
and
ovine
samples
from
China
.

These
partetraviruses
were
detected
by
PCR
in
1.8
%
of
bovine
liver
samples
,
66.7
%
of
ovine
liver
samples
and
71.4
%
of
ovine
spleen
samples
.

One
of
the
bovine
partetraviruses
detected
in
the
present
samples
is
phylogenetically
distinct
from
previously
reported
bovine
partetraviruses
and
likely
represents
a
novel
genotype
.

The
ovine
partetravirus
is
a
novel
partetravirus
and
phylogenetically
most
related
to
the
bovine
partetraviruses
.

The
genome
organization
is
conserved
amongst
these
viruses
,
including
the
presence
of
a
putative
transmembrane
protein
encoded
by
an
overlapping
reading
frame
in
ORF2
.

Results
from
the
present
study
provide
further
support
to
the
classification
of
partetraviruses
as
a
separate
genus
in
Parvovirinae
.

Acute
undifferentiated
fever
(
AUF
)
is
frequently
observed
in
tropical
settings
,
but
diagnosing
the
cause
of
AUF
is
often
a
challenge
for
local
physicians
and
the
physicians
treating
returning
travellers
.

We
conducted
a
case-control
study
in
central
Vietnam
in
2016
.

A
total
of
378
febrile
adult
patients
(
AUFs
)
with
a
fever
for
≤21
days
,
no
evidence
of
localized
infection
and
negative
screening
tests
for
dengue
and
malaria
,
and
384
afebrile
adult
patients
(
Controls
)
were
prospectively
enrolled
.

Whole
blood
,
plasma
,
eschar
swab
,
throat
swab
and
urine
specimens
were
collected
and
analysed
.

Quantitative
PCR
and
RT-PCR
were
used
to
test
for
55
bacteria
,
viruses
and
their
subtypes
.

Serological
tests
were
also
used
to
test
for
rickettsial
agents
.

The
most
common
aetiology
was
influenza
virus
(
20.9
%
in
AUFs
vs.
0
%
in
Controls
)
,
followed
by
rickettsial
agents
(
mainly
Orientia
tsutsugamushi
and
Rickettsia
typhi
)
(
10.8
%
vs.
0.3
%
)
,
dengue
virus
(
7.7
%
vs.
0.5
%
)
,
Leptospira
(
4.8
%
vs.
0.8
%
)
,
adenovirus
(
4.8
%
vs.
1.0
%
)
,
and
enterovirus
(
2.1
%
vs.
0
%
)
(
p
<
.05
)
.

The
real
proportion
of
dengue
in
AUF
cases
was
underestimated
because
patients
with
denguepositive
rapid
diagnosis
tests
were
excluded
from
the
study
.

The
emerging
agent
Rickettsia
felis
,
which
had
not
been
previously
observed
in
Vietnam
,
was
detected
in
this
study
.

In
total
,
216
patients
(
57.1
%
)
were
given
causative
diagnoses
,
comprising
143
(
66.2
%
)
monoinfections
and
73
(
33.8
%
)
coinfections
.

The
infections
caused
by
these
agents
should
be
considered
in
clinical
practice
and
further
studies
.

Additionally
,
agents
susceptible
to
doxycycline
were
detected
in
15.6
%
of
AUFs
;
thus
,
this
drug
should
be
included
in
the
panel
used
to
treat
AUF
patients
.

Ten
potential
reference
genes
were
compared
for
their
use
in
experiments
investigating
cellular
mRNA
expression
of
virus
infected
cells
.

Human
cell
lines
were
infected
with
Cytomegalovirus
,
Human
Herpesvirus-6
,
Camelpox
virus
,
SARS
coronavirus
or
Yellow
fever
virus
.

The
expression
levels
of
these
genes
and
the
viral
replication
were
determined
by
real-time
PCR
.

Genes
were
ranked
by
the
BestKeeper
tool
,
the
GeNorm
tool
and
by
criteria
we
reported
previously
.

Ranking
lists
of
the
genes
tested
were
tool
dependent
.

However
,
over
all
,
β-actin
is
an
unsuitable
as
reference
gene
,
whereas
TATA-Box
binding
protein
and
peptidyl-prolyl-isomerase
A
are
stable
reference
genes
for
expression
studies
in
virus
infected
cells
.

Design
of
an
envelope-based
immunogen
capable
of
inducing
a
broadly
neutralizing
antibody
response
is
thought
to
be
key
to
the
development
of
a
protective
HIV-1
vaccine
.

However
,
the
broad
diversity
of
viral
variants
and
a
limited
ability
to
produce
native
envelope
have
hampered
such
design
efforts
.

Here
we
describe
adaptation
of
the
yeast
display
system
and
use
of
a
combinatorial
protein
engineering
approach
to
permit
directed
evolution
of
HIV
envelope
variants
.

Because
the
intrinsic
instability
and
complexity
of
this
trimeric
glycoprotein
has
greatly
impeded
the
development
of
immunogens
that
properly
represent
the
structure
of
native
envelope
,
this
platform
addresses
an
essential
need
for
methodologies
with
the
capacity
to
rapidly
engineer
HIV
spike
proteins
towards
improved
homogeneity
,
stability
,
and
presentation
of
neutralizing
epitopes
.

We
report
for
the
first
time
the
display
of
a
designed
SOSIP
gp140
on
yeast
,
and
the
in
vitro
evolution
of
derivatives
with
greatly
improved
expression
and
binding
to
conformation-dependent
antibodies
.

These
efforts
represent
an
initial
and
critical
step
toward
the
ability
to
rapidly
engineer
HIV-1
envelope
immunogens
via
directed
evolution

Tetraspanins
are
suggested
to
regulate
the
composition
of
cell
membrane
components
and
control
intracellular
transport
,
which
leaves
them
vulnerable
to
utilization
by
pathogens
such
as
human
papillomaviruses
(
HPV
)
and
cytomegaloviruses
(
HCMV
)
to
facilitate
host
cell
entry
and
subsequent
infection
.

In
this
study
,
by
means
of
cellular
depletion
,
the
cluster
of
differentiation
(
CD
)
tetraspanins
CD9
,
CD63
,
and
CD151
were
found
to
reduce
HPV16
infection
in
HeLa
cells
by
50
to
80
%
.

Moreover
,
we
tested
recombinant
proteins
or
peptides
of
specific
tetraspanin
domains
on
their
effect
on
the
most
oncogenic
HPV
type
,
HPV16
,
and
HCMV
.

We
found
that
the
C-terminal
tails
of
CD63
and
CD151
significantly
inhibited
infections
of
both
HPV16
and
HCMV
.

Although
CD9
was
newly
identified
as
a
key
cellular
factor
for
HPV16
infection
,
the
recombinant
CD9
C-terminal
peptide
had
no
effect
on
infection
.

Based
on
the
determined
half-maximal
inhibitory
concentration
(
IC
50
)
,
we
classified
CD63
and
CD151
C-terminal
peptides
as
moderate
to
potent
inhibitors
of
HPV16
infection
in
HeLa
and
HaCaT
cells
,
and
in
EA.hy926
,
HFF
(
human
foreskin
fibroblast
)
cells
,
and
HEC-LTT
(
human
endothelial
cell-large
T
antigen
and
telomerase
)
cells
for
HCMV
,
respectively
.

These
results
indicate
that
HPV16
and
HCMV
share
similar
cellular
requirements
for
their
entry
into
host
cells
and
reveal
the
necessity
of
the
cytoplasmic
CD151
and
CD63
C-termini
in
virus
infections
.

Furthermore
,
this
highlights
the
suitability
of
these
peptides
for
functional
investigation
of
tetraspanin
domains
and
as
inhibitors
of
pathogen
infections
.

Virus
discovery
from
high
throughput
sequencing
data
often
follows
a
bottom-up
approach
where
taxonomic
annotation
takes
place
prior
to
association
to
disease
.

Albeit
effective
in
some
cases
,
the
approach
fails
to
detect
novel
pathogens
and
remote
variants
not
present
in
reference
databases
.

We
have
developed
a
species
independent
pipeline
that
utilises
sequence
clustering
for
the
identification
of
nucleotide
sequences
that
co-occur
across
multiple
sequencing
data
instances
.

We
applied
the
workflow
to
686
sequencing
libraries
from
252
cancer
samples
of
different
cancer
and
tissue
types
,
32
non-template
controls
,
and
24
test
samples
.

Recurrent
sequences
were
statistically
associated
to
biological
,
methodological
or
technical
features
with
the
aim
to
identify
novel
pathogens
or
plausible
contaminants
that
may
associate
to
a
particular
kit
or
method
.

We
provide
examples
of
identified
inhabitants
of
the
healthy
tissue
flora
as
well
as
experimental
contaminants
.

Unmapped
sequences
that
co-occur
with
high
statistical
significance
potentially
represent
the
unknown
sequence
space
where
novel
pathogens
can
be
identified
.

Severe
fever
with
thrombocytopenia
syndrome
(
SFTS
)
is
an
emerging
tick-borne
infectious
disease
caused
by
SFTS
virus
(
SFTSV
)
,
which
is
a
novel
bunyavirus
.

SFTSV
was
first
isolated
from
patients
who
presented
with
fever
,
thrombocytopenia
,
leukocytopenia
,
and
multiorgan
dysfunction
in
China
.

Subsequently
,
it
was
found
to
be
widely
distributed
in
Southeast
Asia
(
Korea
,
Japan
,
and
Vietnam
)
.

SFTSV
can
be
transmitted
not
only
from
ticks
but
also
from
domestic
animals
,
companion
animals
,
and
humans
.

Because
the
case
fatality
rate
of
SFTS
is
high
(
6-30
%
)
,
development
of
specific
and
effective
treatment
for
SFTS
is
required
.

Studies
of
potential
antiviral
drugs
for
SFTS-specific
therapy
have
been
conducted
on
existing
or
newly
discovered
agents
in
vitro
and
in
vivo
,
with
ribavirin
and
favipiravir
being
the
most
promising
candidates
.

While
animal
experiments
and
retrospective
studies
have
demonstrated
the
limited
efficacy
of
ribavirin
,
it
was
also
speculated
that
ribavirin
would
be
effective
in
patients
with
a
viral
load
<
1
×
10
6
copies/mL
.

Favipiravir
showed
higher
efficacy
than
ribavirin
against
SFTSV
in
in
vitro
assays
and
greater
efficacy

evaluating
the

of

for
their
inhibitory

against

.

Among
them
,
calcium

in

to
their

further
research
is
necessary
to
develop

achieved
in

Ubiquitination
plays
a
critical
role
in
many
cellular
processes
.

A
growing
number
of
viruses
have
evolved
strategies
to
exploit
the
ubiquitin-proteasome
system
,
including
members
of
the
Poxviridae
family
.

Members
of
the
poxvirus
family
have
recently
been
shown
to
encode
BTB/kelch
and
ankyrin/F-box
proteins
that
interact
with
cullin-3
and
cullin-1
based
ubiquitin
ligases
,
respectively
.

Multiple
members
of
the
poxvirus
family
also
encode
ubiquitin
ligases
with
intrinsic
activity
.

This
review
describes
the
numerous
mechanisms
that
poxviruses
employ
to
manipulate
the
ubiquitin-proteasome
system
.

Asthma
exacerbations
often
occur
due
to
infectious
triggers
,
but
determining
whether
infection
is
present
and
whether
it
is
bacterial
or
viral
remains
clinically
challenging
.

A
diagnostic
strategy
that
clarifies
these
uncertainties
could
enable
personalized
asthma
treatment
and
mitigate
antibiotic
overuse

bacterial

in

.

Subjects
with
suspected
asthma
exacerbations
of
various
etiologies
were
retrospectively
selected
for
peripheral
blood
gene
expression
analysis
from
a
pool
of
subjects
previously
enrolled
in

departments

acute
respiratory
illness
.

RT-PCR
quantified
87
gene
targets
,

from

studies
,
followed
by
logistic

modeling
to
define
bacterial
,
viral
,
or
noninfectious
class
.

The
model-predicted
class
was
compared
to
clinical
adjudication
and
procalcitonin
.

Of
46
subjects
enrolled
,
7
were
clinically
adjudicated
as
bacterial
,
18
as
viral
,
and
21
as
noninfectious
.

Model
prediction
was
congruent
with
clinical
adjudication
in
15/18
viral
and
13/21
noninfectious
cases
,
but
only
1/7
bacterial
cases
.

None
of
the
adjudicated
bacterial
cases
had
confirmatory
microbiology
;
the
precise
etiology
in
this
group
was
uncertain
.

Procalcitonin
classified
only
one
subject
in
the
cohort
as
bacterial
.

47.8
%
of
subjects
received
antibiotics
.

Some
viruses
within
the
Caliciviridae
family
initiate
their
replication
cycle
by
attachment
to
cell
surface
carbohydrate
moieties
,
histo-blood
group
antigens
(
HBGAs
)
,
and/or
terminal
sialic
acids
(
SAs
)
.

Although
bovine
nebovirus
(
BNeV
)
,
one
of
the
enteric
caliciviruses
,
is
an
important
causative
agent
of
acute
gastroenteritis
in
cattle
,
its
attachment
factors
and
possibly
other
cellular
receptors
remain
unknown
.

Using
a
comprehensive
series
of
protein-ligand
biochemical
assays
,
we
sought
to
determine
whether
BNeV
recognizes
cell
surface
HBGAs
and/or
SAs
as
attachment
factors
.

It
was
found
that
BNeV
virus-like
particles
(
VLPs
)
bound
to
A
type/H
type
2/Le
y
HBGAs
expressed
in
the
bovine
digestive
tract
and
are
related
to
HBGAs
expressed
in
humans
and
other
host
species
,
suggesting
a
wide
spectrum
of
HBGA
recognition
by
BNeV
.

BNeV
VLPs
also
bound
to
a
large
variety
of
different
bovine
and
human
saliva
samples
of
all
ABH
and
Lewis
types
,
supporting
previously
obtained
results
and
suggesting
a
zoonotic
potential
of
BNeV
transmission
.

Removal
of
␣1,2-linked
fucose
and
␣1,3/4-linked
fucose
epitopes
of
target
HBGAs
by
confirmation-specific
enzymes
reduced
the
binding
of
BNeV
VLPs
to
synthetic
HBGAs
,
bovine
and
human
saliva
,
cultured
cell
lines
,
and
bovine
small
intestine
mucosa
,
further
supporting
a
wide
HBGA
binding
spectrum
of
BNeV
through
recognition
of
␣1,2linked
fucose
and
␣1,3/4-linked
fucose
epitopes
of
targeted
HBGAs
.

However
,
removal
of
terminal
␣2,3and
␣2,6-linked
SAs
by
their
specific
enzyme
had
no
inhibitory
effects
on
binding
of
BNeV
VLPs
,
indicating
that
BNeV
does
not
use
terminal
SAs
as
attachment
factors
.

Further
details
of
the
binding
specificity
of
BNeV
remain
to
be
explored
.

IMPORTANCE
Enteric
caliciviruses
such
as
noroviruses
,
sapoviruses
,
and
recoviruses
are
the
most
important
etiological
agents
of
severe
acute
gastroenteritis
in
humans
and
many
other
mammalian
host
species
.

They
initiate
infection
by
attachment
to
cell
surface
carbohydrate
moieties
,
HBGAs
,
and/or
terminal
SAs
.

However
,
the
attachment
factor
(
s
)
for
BNeV
,
a
recently
classified
enteric
calicivirus
genus/type
species
,
remains
unexplored
.

Here
,
we
demonstrate
that
BNeV
VLPs
have
a
wide
spectrum
of
binding
to
synthetic
HBGAs
,
bovine
and
human
saliva
samples
,
and
bovine
duodenal
sections
.

We
further
discovered
that
␣1,2-linked
fucose
and
␣1,3/4-linked
fucose
epitopes
are
essential
for
binding
of
BNeV
VLPs
.

However
,
BNeV
VLPs
do
not
bind
to
terminal
SAs
on
cell
carbohydrates
.

Continued
investigation
regarding
the
proteinaceous
receptor
(
s
)
will
be
necessary
for
better
understanding
of
the
tropism
,
pathogenesis
,
and
host
range
of
this
important
viral
genus
.

Emerging
evidence
suggests
that
dipeptidyl
peptidase-4
(
DPP-4
)
inhibitors
used
to
treat
type
2
diabetes
may
have
nephroprotective
effects
beyond
the
reduced
renal
risk
conferred
by
glycemic
control
.

DPP-4
is
a
ubiquitous
protein
with
exopeptidase
activity
that
exists
in
cell
membrane-bound
and
soluble
forms
.

Background
:
In
response
to
an
unexpected
long
cold
spell
in
February
1996
which
killed
more
than
100
older
adults
(
mostly
living
alone
)
in
Hong
Kong
,
the
Hong
Kong
Senior
Citizen
Home
Safety
Association
established
a
Personal
Emergency
Link
Service
to
provide
emergency
contact
to
the
older
adults
,
which
uses
a
telephone
system
to
render
emergency
relief
and
total
care
service
around
the
clock
.

To
facilitate
the
dynamic
and
efficient
allocation
of
service
resources
,
it
is
crucial
to
understand
the
factors
linked
with
use
of
the
services
and
number
of
hospital
admissions
arising
from
PE
link
service
.

Methods
:
We
initially
use
the
Poisson
generalized
linear
model
(
GLM
)
with
polynomial
effect
functions
of
relevant
covariates
.

If
the
time
series
of
residuals
from
fitting
the
Poisson
GLM
reveals
significant
serial
correlation
,
a
Poisson
generalized
linear
autoregressive
moving
average
(
GLARMA
)
model
is
refitted
to
the
data
to
account
for
the
auto-correlation
among
the
time
series
of
daily
call
numbers
.

If
the
data
is
overdispersed
relative
to
the
best
fitting
Poisson
GLARMA
model
,
then
the
negative
binomial
GLARMA
model
is
refitted
to
account
for
any
overdispersion
.

In
all
the
models
,
dummy
variables
for
weekdays
and
months
are
included
to
account
for
any
cyclic
trends
due
weekday
effect
or
month
of
the
year
effect
.

The
secular
time
trend
is
modeled
by
a
polynomial
function
of
calendar
time
over
the
study
period
.

Finally
any
critical
temperatures
are
identified
by
visually
inspecting
the
graph
of
the
effect
function
of
temperature
.

Results
:
The
weekday
and
month
effects
are
both
significant
with
Monday
seeing
more
PE
Link
calls
than
Sunday
and
June
seeing
less
than
January
.

Temperature
has
significant
effect
on
the
PE
Link
call
rate
with
the
effect
highly
nonlinear
.

A
critical
temperature
,
below
which
excessive
increase
in
PE
link
calls
that
lead
to
hospital
admissions
,
is
identified
to
be
around
15°C
.

Conclusion
:
Identifying
a
threshold
temperature
which
generates
an
excessive
increase
in
the
expected
number
of
PE
Link
calls
would
be
useful
in
service
provision
planning
and
support
for
elderly
in
need
of
hospital
admission
.

The
genetic
variability
of
Infectious
bronchitis
virus
(
IBV
)
is
one
of
the
main
challenges
for
its
control
,
hindering
not
only
the
development
of
effective
vaccination
strategies
but
also
its
classification
and
,
consequently
,
epidemiology
understanding
.

The
624/I
and
Q1
genotypes
,
now
recognized
to
be
part
of
the
GI-16
lineage
,
represent
an
excellent
example
of
the
practical
consequences
of
IBV
molecular
epidemiology
limited
knowledge
.

In
fact
,
being
their
common
origin
unrecognized
for
a
long
time
,
independent
epidemiological
pictures
were
drawn
for
the
two
genotypes
.

To
fix
this
misinterpretation
,
the
present
study
reconstructs
the
history
,
population
dynamics
and
spreading
patterns
of
GI-16
lineage
as
a
whole
using
a
phylodynamic
approach
.

A
collection
of
worldwide
available
hypervariable
region
1
and
2
(
HVR12
)
and
3
(
HVR3
)
sequences
of
the
S1
protein
was
analysed
together
with
258
HVR3
sequences
obtained
from
samples
collected
in
Italy
(
the
country
where
this
genotype
was
initially
identified
)
since
1963
.

The
results
demonstrate
that
after
its
emergence
at
the
beginning
of
the
XX
century
,
GI-16
was
able
to
persist
until
present
days
in
Italy
.

Approximately
in
the
late
1980s
,
it
migrated
to
Asia
,
which
became
the
main
nucleus
for
further
spreading
to
Middle
East
,
Europe
and
especially
South
America
,
likely
through
multiple
introduction
events
.

A
remarkable
among-country
diffusion
was
also
demonstrated
in
Asia
and
South
America
.

Interestingly
,
although
most
of
the
recent
Italian
GI-16
strains
originated
from
ancestral
viruses
detected
in
the
same
country
,
a
couple
were
closely
related
to
Chinese
ones
,
supporting
a
backward
viral
flow
from
China
to
Italy
.

Besides
to
the
specific
case-study
results
,
this
work
highlights
the
misconceptions
that
originate
from
the
lack
of
a
unified
nomenclature
and
poor
molecular
epidemiology
data
generation
and
sharing
.

This
shortcoming
appears
particularly
relevant
since
the
described
scenario
could
likely
be
shared
by
many
other
IBV
genotypes
and
pathogens
in
general
.

Gammacoronavirus
,
family
Coronaviridae
.

The
viral
genome
is
about
27
Kb
long
and
encodes
for
different
proteins
,
such
as
the
RNA-dependent
RNA
polymerase
(
RdRp
)
,
numerous
accessory
and
regulatory
proteins
and
the
Spike
,
Envelope
,
Membrane
,
and
Nucleocapsid
structural
proteins
[

]
.

IBV
currently
represents
one
of
the
most
relevant
diseases
of
poultry
farming
,
being
responsible
for
respiratory
signs
,
reproductive
disorders
and
relevant
mortality
,
particularly
in
presence
of
nephropathogenic
strains
or
secondary
infections
[
2
]
.

Similarly
to
other
RNA
viruses
,
it
is
characterized
by
high
evolutionary
and
recombination
rates
,
which
drive
the
rapid
evolution
of
this
pathogen
and
lead
to
a
remarkable
genetic
and
phenotypic
heterogeneity
[

]
.

The
Spike
protein
,
further
processed
in
the
S1
and
S2
sub-units
,
is
by
far
the
most
studied
viral
protein
because
of
its
relevance
in
viral
life-cycle
and
host
interaction
.

Besides
being
involved
in
viral
attachment
and
viral-host
membranes
fusion
,
it
is
also
the
main
target
of
the
host
neutralizing
immune
response
[
1
,
4
]
.

Its
remarkable
variability
has
several
implications
,
the
most
practical
one
being
the
poor
cross
protection
among
different
viral
strains
and
genotypes
[
5
]
,
which
severely
hinders
the
infection
and
disease
control
through
vaccination
.

Additionally
,
the
genetic
variability
has
also
complicated
the
viral
classification
,
leading
to
the
proposal
of
a
multitude
of
genotypes
based
on
specific
research
studies
or
local
investigations
,
in
absence
of
shared
criteria
.

Although
it
could
appear
a
mere
nomenclature
issue
,
this
state
of
affairs
had
astonishing
implications
impeding
or
confusing
the
proper
understanding
of

epidemiology
.

Only
in
2016
,
in
the
framework
of
COST
Action
FA1207
,
a
coherent
and
common
IBV
genotype
classification
was
proposed
[
6
]
,
grouping
the
identified
strains
in
6
genotypes
and
32
lineages
.

Interestingly
,
Valastro
et
al.
,
(
2016
)
,
confirmed
what
previously
proposed
by
Franzo
et
al.
,
[
7
]
about
the
clustering
of
624/I
(
genbank
accession
number
JQ901492
)
and
Q1
genotypes
in
the
same
group
in
the
phylogenetic
tree
based
on
the
partial
S1
gene
(
currently
named
GI-16
)
.

Until
then
,
the
two
genotypes
had
been
named
(
and
considered
)
independent
:
the
624/I
was
first
reported
in
Italy
in
1993
[
8
]
,
and
thereafter
in
Slovenia
[
9
]
,
Poland
[
10
]
,
and
Russia
[
11
]
.

Moreover
,
retrospective
studies
demonstrated
its
wide
circulation
in
Italy
since
the
early
1960s
[
12
]
,
where
it
remained
the
most
prevalent
genotype
for
more
than
a
decade
.

However
,
from
the
1990s
,
its
detection
and
reporting
became
sporadic
or
absent
.

At
the
same
time
,
in
1996
,
a
new
IBV
strain
(
later
renamed
Q1
)
was
identified
in
animals
affected
by
proventriculitis
[
13
]
in
China
and
thereafter
in
other
Asian
[
14
,
15
]
,
Middle
Eastern
[
16
,
17
]
,
South
American
[
18
,
19
]
and
European
countries
[
7
,
[
20
]
[
21
]
[
22
]
.

Remarkably
,
not
recognizing
the
relationship
between
these
strains
,
a
new
spread
from
Asia
was
supposed
,
similarly
what
was
proven
for
the
GI-19
lineage
(
QX
genotype
)
[
23
]
.

Data
recently
published
by
Laconi
et
al
.

[
24
]
strongly
suggest
a
common
origin
between
the
624I
and
Q1
genotypes
,
however
the
actual
origin
and
dispersal
pattern
of
GI-16
lineage
could
not
be
inferred
confidently
.

The
insight
provided
by
recent
genetic
studies
[
6
,
7
]
raised
new
questions
about
the
history
,
epidemiology
and
spreading
of
the
GI-16
lineage
around
the
world
.

The
knowledge
of
these
processes
would
be
of
interest
not
only
for
the
particular
case
under
investigation
,
but
could
also
provide
useful
information
on
the
general
intra-and
inter-continents
viral
dispersion
patterns
,
aiding
the
development
and
implementation
of
adequate
control
measures
.

Unfortunately
,
the
paucity
of
sequences
available
before
Q1
detection
in
China
prevented
this
investigation
for
a
long
time
.

In
the
present
study
,
a
high
number
of
retrospective
GI-16
sequences
were
generated
from
Italian
samples
collected
since
1963
and
analyzed
together
with
the
worldwide
available
ones
using
a
phylodynamic
approach
to
reconstruct
the
history
of
this
lineage
and
infer
its
spreading
pattern
around
the
world

After
the
first
reported
case
of
Zika
virus
(
ZIKV
)
in
Brazil
,
in
2015
,
a
significant
increase
in
the
reported
cases
of
microcephaly
was
observed
.

Microcephaly
is
a
neurological
condition
in
which
the
infant
's
head
is
significantly
smaller
with
complications
in
brain
development
.

Recently
,
two
small
membrane-associated
interferon-inducible
transmembrane
proteins
(
IFITM1
and
IFITM3
)
have
been
shown
to
repress
members
of
the
flaviviridae
family
which
includes
ZIKV
.

However
,
the
exact
mechanisms
leading
to
the
inhibition
of
the
virus
are
yet
unknown
.

Here
,
we
assembled
an
interactome
of
IFITM1
and
IFITM3
with
known
protein-protein
interactions
(
PPIs
)
collected
from
publicly
available
databases
and
novel
PPIs
predicted
using
the
High-confidence
Protein-Protein
Interaction
Prediction
(
HiPPIP
)
model
.

We
analyzed
the
functional
and
pathway
associations
of
the
interacting
proteins
,
and
found
that
there
are
several
immunity
pathways
(
toll-like
receptor
signaling
,
cd28
signaling
in
T-helper
cells
,
crosstalk
between
dendritic
cells
and
natural
killer
cells
)
,
neuronal
pathways
(
axonal
guidance
signaling
,
neural
tube
closure
and
actin
cytoskeleton
signaling
)
and
developmental
pathways
(
neural
tube
closure
,
embryonic
skeletal
system
development
)
that
are
associated
with
these
interactors
.

Our
novel
PPIs
associate
cilia
dysfunction
in
ependymal
cells
to
microcephaly
,
and
may
also
shed
light
on
potential
targets
of
ZIKV
for
host
invasion
by
immunosuppression
and
cytoskeletal
rearrangements
.

These
results
could
help
direct
future
research
in
elucidating
the
mechanisms
underlying
host
defense
to
ZIKV
and
other
flaviviruses
.

We
have
added
a
brief
description
about
HiPPIP
,
the
computational
method
that
was
employed
to
predict
proteinprotein
interactions
.

This
method
has
been
described
in
detail

Background
Healthcare
workers
may
be
exposed
to
people
with
respiratory
viral
infections
more
often
than
other
working
adults
.

Understanding
the
risk
and
the
effectiveness
of
different
preventive
measures
is
of
great
importance
.

Objectives
To
estimate
adherence
to
prophylactic
antiviral
medication
for
a
full
influenza
season
,
to
the
compare
efficacy
of
antiviral
prophylaxis
to
that
of
the
seasonal
influenza
vaccine
and
to
identify
exposures
that
increase
risk
of
acute
respiratory
illnesses
(
ARI
)
in
healthy
adults
.

Methods
Participants
were
randomized

to
receive
the
2008-2009
influenza
vaccine
or
daily
prophylaxis
with
10
mg
of
zanamivir
during
the
season
.

Web-based
questionnaires
collected
information
on

.

Results
Sixty-four
healthy
adults
were
recruited
in
November
2008
.

Three
of
40
active
participants
discontinued
zanamivir
due
to
side
effects
;
the
remaining
37
took
>
85
%
of
scheduled
doses
for
a
median
of
121
days
.

Symptomatic
,
laboratory-confirmed
influenza
was
detected
in
one
person
randomized
to
zanamivir
(
2Á5

)
and
2/
20
(
10
%
)
who
received
the
vaccine
(
P
=
0Á25
)
.

Forty-seven
participants
reported
109
episodes
of
ARI
.

Factors
associated
with
an
ARI
were
exposure
to
a
spouse
(

,
child
(

or
patient
(

)
with
symptoms
of
an
ARI
in
the
previous
7
days
.

Conclusions
Breakthrough
influenza
infection
occurred
in
both
vaccinated
participants
and
those
receiving
antiviral
prophylaxis
.

Most
adults
were
willing
and
able
to
comply
with
season-long
prophylaxis
.

Report
of
recent
exposure
to
family
members
and
patients
with
an
ARI
increased
the
risk
of
developing
an
ARI
in
healthy
adults
.

Identification
and
typing
of
human
enterovirus
(
HEVs
)
are
important
to
pathogen
detection
and
therapy
.

Previous
phylogeny-based
typing
methods
are
mainly
based
on
multiple
sequence
alignments
of
specific
genes
in
the
HEVs
,
but
the
results
are
not
stable
with
respect
to
different
choices
of
genes
.

Here
we
report
a
novel
method
for
identification
and
typing
of
HEVs
based
on
information
derived
from
their
whole
genomes
.

Specifically
,
we
calculate
the
k-mer
based
barcode
image
for
each
genome
,
HEV
or
other
human
viruses
,
for
a
fixed
k
,
1
,
k,7
,
where
a
genome
barcode
is
defined
in
terms
of
the
kmer
frequency
distribution
across
the
whole
genome
for
all
combinations
of
k-mers
.

A
phylogenetic
tree
is
constructed
using
a
barcode-based
distance
and
a
neighbor-joining
method
among
a
set
of
443
representative
non-HEV
human
viruses
and
395
HEV
sequences
.

The
tree
shows
a
clear
separation
of
the
HEV
viruses
from
all
the
non-HEV
viruses
with
100
%
accuracy
and
a
separation
of
the
HEVs
into
four
distinct
clads
with
93.4
%
consistency
with
a
multiple
sequence
alignmentbased
phylogeny
.

Our
detailed
analyses
of
the
HEVs
having
different
typing
results
by
the
two
methods
indicate
that
our
results
are
in
better
agreement
with
known
information
about
the
HEVs
.

Background
:
Four
species
of
human
bocaviruses
(
HBoV1-4
)
have
been
identified
based
on
phylogenetic
analysis
since
its
first
report
in
2005
.

HBoV1
has
been
associated
with
respiratory
disease
,
whereas
HBoV2-4
are
mainly
detected
in
enteric
infections
.

Although
the
prevalence
of
HBoVs
in
humans
has
been
studied
in
some
regions
,
it
has
not
been
well
addressed
globally
.

Methodology/Principal
Findings
:
Cross-reactivity
of
anti-VP2
antibodies
was
detected
between
HBoV1
,
2
,
3
,
and
4
in
mouse
and
human
serum
.

The
prevalence
of
specific
anti-VP2
IgG
antibodies
against
HBoV1-4
was
determined
in
different
age
groups
of
healthy
individuals
aged
0-70
years
old
in
Beijing
,
China
,
using
a
competition
ELISA
assay
based
on
virus-like
particles
of
HBoV1-4
.

The
seroprevalence
of
HBoV1-4
was
50
%
,
36.9
%
,
28.7
%
,
and
0.8
%
,
respectively
,
in
children
aged
0-14
years
(
n
=
244
)
;
whereas
the
seroprevalence
of
HBoV1-4
was
66.9
%
,
49.3
%
,
38.7
%
and
1.4
%
,
respectively
,
in
healthy
adults
(
$
15
years
old
;
n
=
142
)
.

The
seropositive
rate
of
HBoV1
was
higher
than
that
of
HBoV2
,
HBoV3
,
and
HBoV4
in
individuals
older
than
0.5
years
.

Furthermore
,
IgG
seroconversion
of
HBoV1
(
10/31
,
32.3
%
)
,
HBoV2
(
8/31
,
25.8
%
)
,
and
HBoV3
(
2/31
,
6.5
%
)
was
found
in
paired
sera
collected
from
children
with
respiratory
tract
infections
who
were
positive
for
HBoV1
according
to
PCR
analysis
.

Conclusions/Significance
:
Our
data
indicate
that
HBoV1
is
more
prevalent
than
HBoV2
,
HBoV3
,
and
HBoV4
in
the
population
we
sampled
in
Beijing
,
China
,
suggesting
that
HBoV
species
may
play
differential
roles
in
disease
.

Zika
virus
(
ZIKV
)
is
a
highly
transmissive
virus
that
belongs
to
the
Flaviviridae
family
,
which
comprises
several
other
pathogens
that
threaten
human
health
.

This
re-emerging
virus
gained
attention
during
the
outbreak
in
Brazil
in
2016
,
where
a
considerable
number
of
microcephaly
cases
in
newborns
was
associated
with
ZIKV
infection
during
pregnancy
.

Lacking
a
preventive
vaccine
or
antiviral
drugs
,
efforts
have
been
made
to
better
understand
the
viral
life
cycle
.

In
light
of
this
,
the
relevance
of
the
endosomal-lysosomal
compartment
for
the
ZIKV
life
cycle
was
investigated
.

A549
and
SH-SY5Y
cells
were
infected
with
either
the
African
strain
(
associated
with
mild
symptoms
)
or
the
French
Polynesia
strain
(
associated
with
neurological
complications
)
.

For
both
strains
,
the
V-ATPase
inhibitor
,
bafilomycin
A1
,
efficiently
inhibited
ZIKV
entry
and
prevented
the
spread
of
the
infection
by
interfering
with
viral
maturation
.

Additionally
,
affecting
cholesterol
metabolism
and
transport
with
the
drug
U18666A
,
which
inactivates
late
endosomes
and
lysosomes
,
impairs
the
viral
life
cycle
.

The
data
presented
show
a
clear
antiviral
effect
of
two
compounds
that
target
the
same
compartments
in
different
ways
.

This
highlights
the
relevance
of
the
endosomal-lysosomal
compartment
for
the
viral
life
cycle
that
should
be
considered
as
a
target
for
antivirals
.

Viruses

initiates
with
the
interaction
between
the
viral
envelope
protein
and
the
host
cell
receptors
and
adhesion/entry
factors
,
such
as
DC-SIGN
,
AXL
,
Tyro3
and
Tim-1
[
15
]
.

Nevertheless
,
there
are
conflicting
data
about
the
relevance
of
AXL
as
the
primary
receptor
of
ZIKV
entry
[
16
]
[
17
]
[
18
]
.

After
internalization
via
receptor-mediated
endocytosis
,
it
is
assumed
that
the
acidification
of
the
late
endosomes
,
also
termed
multivesicular
bodies
(
MVBs
)
,
promotes
a
structural
change
in
the
viral
envelope
,
allowing
the
fusion
between
the
endosomal
membrane
and
the
envelope
.

This
leads
to
the
release
of
the
viral
nucleocapsid
into
the
cytoplasm
and
,
consequently
,
to
the
disassembling
of
the
capsid
and
the
uncoating
of
the
viral
RNA
[
19
,
20
]
.

After
the
genomic
RNA
has
been
translated
and
replicated
,
a
newly
synthesized
immature
viral
particle
is
assembled
and
conducted
to
the
secretory
pathway
.

In
this
immature
form
,
the
pr
peptide
covers
approximately
12
amino
acids
of
the
fusion
loop
of
the
envelope
protein
and
,
thus
,
prevents
premature
fusion
within
the
cell
.

In
the
trans-Golgi
network
(
TGN
)
,
the
viral
particle
undergoes
maturation
as
a
result
of
a
structural
modification
induced
by
the
low
pH
that
allows
the
cleavage
of
the
prM
by
a
furin-like
protease
,
exposing
the
fusion
loop
.

Lastly
,
the
infectious
viral
particle
exits
the
cell
by
exocytosis
and
the
pr
fragment
dissociates
from
the
virion
due
to
the
neutral
pH
of
the
extracellular
environment
[
21
,

]
.

Besides
the
bite
of
an
infected
mosquito
(
Aedes
aegypti
and
Aedes
albopictus
)
,
ZIKV
infection
can
occur
through
perinatal
transmission
,
sexual
contact
and
blood
transfusion
[

[
24
]
[

]
[

]
.

Since
there
is
no
vaccine
or
a
specific
antiviral
drug
available
against
ZIKV
,
understanding
the
viral
life
cycle
and
finding
ways
to
control
infection
has
become
urgent
.

Although
the
ZIKV
life
cycle
is
often
described
to
resemble
the
life
cycle
of
other
flavivirus
members
,
a
variety
of
open
questions
with
respect
to
the
viral
life
cycle
still
exists
.

In
light
of
this
,
the
importance
of
the
endosomal-lysosomal
compartment
for
the
ZIKV
life
cycle
was
investigated
.

Firstly
,
the
acidification
of
the
late
endosomes/MVBs
and
the
TGN
compartments
was
impaired
by
the
highly
selective
inhibitor
of
the
vacuolar
H
+
-ATPase
(
V-ATPase
)
,
bafilomycin
A1
[
27
]
.

The
relevance
of
the
acidification
of
the
endosomal
compartment
for
ZIKV
entry
has
been
previously
studied
in
Huh
7
cells
by
Cortese
et
al.
,
more
recently
,
.

Our
data
from
A549
cells
show
that
on
the
one
hand
,
bafilomycin
A1
was
able
to
fully
inhibit
ZIKV
entry
and
,
on
the
other
hand
,
it
interferes
with
viral
maturation
.

Concerning
the
SH-SY5Y
cells
,
bafilomycin
A1
decreased
ZIKV
entry
.

In
the
second
part
of
this
study
,
the
functionality
of
the
late
endosomes
and
lysosomes
was
hindered
by
the
amphipathic
steroid
drug
,
U18666A
.

U18666A
inhibits
the
intracellular
trafficking
of
cholesterol
and
lipids
by
the
direct
inhibition
of
the
Niemann-Pick
type
C
protein
.

This
results
in
cholesterol
accumulation
in
late
endosomes/MVBs
and
lysosomes
,
which
leads
to
the
impairment
of
their
functionality
[
31
]
.

Several
reports
showed
that
U18666A
inhibits
crucial
steps
of
dengue
virus
,
hepatitis
C
virus
,
Ebola
virus

However
,
no
studies
were
performed
to
investigate
the
impact
of
U18666A
on
ZIKV
infection
.

This
work
provides
further
insights
into
the
ZIKV
life
cycle
and
elucidates
crucial
steps
for
viral
entry
and
release
.

The
proteomes
that
make
up
the
collection
of
proteins
in
contemporary
organisms
evolved
through
recombination
and
duplication
of
a
limited
set
of
domains
.

These
protein
domains
are
essentially
the
main
components
of
globular
proteins
and
are
the
most
principal
level
at
which
protein
function
and
protein
interactions
can
be
understood
.

An
important
aspect
of
domain
evolution
is
their
atomic
structure
and
biochemical
function
,
which
are
both
specified
by
the
information
in
the
amino
acid
sequence
.

Changes
in
this
information
may
bring
about
new
folds
,
functions
and
protein
architectures
.

With
the
present
and
still
increasing
wealth
of
sequences
and
annotation
data
brought
about
by
genomics
,
new
evolutionary
relationships
are
constantly
being
revealed
,
unknown
structures
modeled
and
phylogenies
inferred
.

Such
investigations
not
only
help
predict
the
function
of
newly
discovered
proteins
,
but
also
assist
in
mapping
unforeseen
pathways
of
evolution
and
reveal
crucial
,
co-evolving
inter-and
intra-molecular
interactions
.

In
turn
this
will
help
us
describe
how
protein
domains
shaped
cellular
interaction
networks
and
the
dynamics
with
which
they
are
regulated
in
the
cell
.

Additionally
,
these
studies
can
be
used
for
the
design
of
new
and
optimized
protein
domains
for
therapy
.

In
this
review
,
we
aim
to
describe
the
basic
concepts
of
protein
domain
evolution
and
illustrate
recent
developments
in
molecular

diseases
such
as
Ebola
,
chikungunya
,
and
Zika
increase
the
necessity
of
knowledgeable
and
skilled
health
professionals
.

Massive
open
online
courses
(
MOOCs
)
arise
as
opportunities
that
allow
people
around
the
world
to
participate
in
higher
education
courses
.

A
search
was
conducted
on
specialized
MOOC
platforms
to
find
courses
related
to
outbreaks
,
using
terms
included
in
the
list
of
the
WHO
disease
outbreaks
from
January
1st
to
December
31
,
2016
.

We
found
seven
courses
about
Ebola
,
two
about
Zika
,
three
about
the
dynamics
of
epidemics
and
pandemics
,
and
only
one
course
about
dengue
,
chikungunya
,
and
malaria
.

Most
of
the
courses
were
conducted
in
English
.

The
courses
on
Ebola
,
Zika
and
chikungunya
were
released
after
their
last
outbreak
.

MOOCs
could
be
used
to
learn
about
health
issues
of
global
relevance
,
and
with
the
necessity
of
fast
divulgation
of
knowledge
and
skills
.

Translating
the
courses
into
more
languages
could
give
these
courses
more
traction
,
and
allow
participation
of
professionals
in
regions
affected
by
these
outbreaks

Utility
of
massive
open
online
courses
(
MOOCs
)
concerning
outbreaks
of
emerging
and
reemerging
diseases
.

F1000Research
.

2017
.

Data
Source

Zika
virus
(
ZIKV
)
was
a
re-emerging
arbovirus
associated
with
Guillain-Barré
Syndrome
in
adult
and
congenital
Zika
syndrome
in
fetus
and
infant
.

Although
ZIKV
was
mainly
transmitted
by
mosquito
bites
,
many
sexual
transmission
cases
have
been
reported
since
the
outbreak
in
2015
.

ZIKV
can
persist
in
testis
and
semen
for
a
long
time
,
causing
testicular
tissue
damage
and
reducing
sperm
quality
.

However
,
no
drug
has
been
approved
for
prevention
or
treatment
of
ZIKV
infection
,
especially
infection
in
male
testicular
tissue
.

Previously
reported
peptide
Z2
could
inactivate
ZIKV
,
inhibiting
ZIKV
infection
in
vitro
and
in
vivo
.

Importantly
,
Z2
could
inhibit
vertical
transmission
of
ZIKV
in
pregnant
mice
,
reducing
ZIKV
infection
in
fetus
.

Here
we
showed
that
intraperitoneally
administered
Z2
could
also
be
distributed
to
testis
and
epididymis
,
resulting
in
the
reduction
of
ZIKV
RNA
copies
in
testicular
tissue
and
protection
of
testis
and
epididymis
against
ZIKV-induced
pathological
damage
and
poor
sperm
quality
in
type
I
interferon
receptor-deficient
A129
mice
.

Thus
,
Z2
,
a
ZIKV
inactivator
,
could
serve
as
an
antiviral
agent
for
treatment
of
ZIKV
infection
and
attenuation
of
ZIKV-induced
testicular
tissue
damage
.

Building
on
a
series
of
ground
breaking
reviews
that
first
defined
and
drew
attention
to
emerging
infectious
diseases
(
EID
)
,
the
'convergence
model
'
was
proposed
to
explain
the
multifactorial
causality
of
disease
emergence
.

The
model
broadly
hypothesizes
disease
emergence
is
driven
by
the
co-incidence
of
genetic
,
physical
environmental
,
ecological
,
and
social
factors
.

We
developed
and
tested
a
model
of
the
emergence
of
highly
pathogenic
avian
influenza
(
HPAI
)
H5N1
based
on
suspected
convergence
factors
that
are
mainly
associated
with
land-use
change
.

Building
on
previous
geospatial
statistical
studies
that
identified
natural
and
human
risk
factors
associated
with
urbanization
,
we
added
new
factors
to
test
whether
causal
mechanisms
and
pathogenic
landscapes
could
be
more
specifically
identified
.

Our
findings
suggest
that
urbanization
spatially
combines
risk
factors
to
produce
particular
types
of
peri-urban
landscapes
with
significantly
higher
HPAI
H5N1
emergence
risk
.

The
work
highlights
that
peri-urban
areas
of
Viet
Nam
have
higher
levels
of
chicken
densities
,
duck
and
geese
flock
size
diversities
,
and
fraction
of
land
under
rice
or
aquaculture
than
rural
and
urban
areas
.

We
also
found
that
land-use
diversity
,
a
surrogate
measure
for
potential
mixing
of
host
populations
and
other
factors
that
likely
influence
viral
transmission
,
significantly
improves
the
model
's
predictability
.

Similarly
,
landscapes
where
intensive
and
extensive
forms
of
poultry
production
overlap
were
found
at
greater
risk
.

These
results
support
the
convergence
hypothesis
in
general
and
demonstrate
the
potential
to
improve
EID
prevention
and
control
by
combing
geospatial
monitoring
of
these
factors
along
with
pathogen
surveillance
programs
.

Immunochromatography
(
IC
)
is
an
antigen-detection
assay
that
plays
an
important
role
in
the
rapid
diagnosis
of
influenza
virus
because
the
protocol
is
short
time
and
easy
to
use
.

Despite
the
usability
of
IC
,
the
sensitivity
is
approximately
10
3
pfu
per
reaction
.

In
addition
,
antigen-antibody
interaction-based
method
can
not
be
used
for
the
detection
of
influenza
viruses
with
major
antigenic
change
.

In
this
study
,
we
established
the
use
of
fluorescent
immunochromatography
(
FLIC
)
to
detect
a
broad
spectrum
of
H5
subtype
influenza
A
viruses
.

This
method
has
improved
sensitivity
10-100
fold
higher
than
traditional
IC
because
of
the
use
of
fluorescent
conjugated
beads
.

Our
Type-E
FLIC
kit
detected
all
of
the
H5
subtype
influenza
viruses
that
were
examined
,
as
well
as
recombinant
hemagglutinin
(
HA
)
proteins
(
rHAs
)
belonging
to
the
Eurasian
H5
subtype
viruses
and
the
Type-N
diagnosed
North
American
H5
subtype
influenza
A
viruses
.

Thus
,
this
kit
has
the
improved
potential
to
detect
H5
subtype
influenza
viruses
of
different
clades
with
both
Type-E
and
Type-N
FLIC
kits
.

Compared
with
PCR-based
diagnosis
,
FLIC
has
a
strong
advantage
in
usability
,
because
the
sample
preparation
required
for
FLIC
is
only
mix-and-drop
without
any
additional
steps
such
as
RNA
extraction
.

Our
results
can
provide
new
strategies
against
the
spread
and
transmission
of
HPAI
H5N1
viruses
in
birds
and
mammals
including
humans
.

Programmed
ribosomal
frameshifting
(
PRF
)
serves
as
an
intrinsic
translational
regulation
mechanism
employed
by
some
viruses
to
control
the
ratio
between
structural
and
enzymatic
proteins
.

Most
viral
mRNAs
which
use
PRF
adapt
an
H-type
pseudoknot
to
stimulate
−1
PRF
.

The
relationship
between
the
thermodynamic
stability
and
the
frameshifting
efficiency
of
pseudoknots
has
not
been
fully
understood
.

Recently
,
single-molecule
force
spectroscopy
has
revealed
that
the
frequency
of
−1
PRF
correlates
with
the
unwinding
forces
required
for
disrupting
pseudoknots
,
and
that
some
of
the
unwinding
work
dissipates
irreversibly
due
to
the
torsional
restraint
of
pseudoknots
.

Complementary
to
single-molecule
techniques
,
computational
modeling
provides
insights
into
global
motions
of
the
ribosome
,
whose
structural
transitions
during
frameshifting
have
not
yet
been
elucidated
in
atomic
detail
.

Taken
together
,
recent
advances
in
biophysical
tools
may
help
to
develop
antiviral
therapies
that
target
the
ubiquitous
−1
PRF
mechanism
among
viruses
.

Background
:
There
are
sparse
data
on
whether
non-pharmaceutical
interventions
can
reduce
the
spread
of
influenza
.

We
implemented
a
study
of
the
feasibility
and
efficacy
of
face
masks
and
hand
hygiene
to
reduce
influenza
transmission
among
Hong
Kong
household
members
.

Methodology/Principal
Findings
:
We
conducted
a
cluster
randomized
controlled
trial
of
households
(
composed
of
at
least
3
members
)
where
an
index
subject
presented
with
influenza-like-illness
of
,48
hours
duration
.

After
influenza
was
confirmed
in
an
index
case
by
the
QuickVue
Influenza
A+B
rapid
test
,
the
household
of
the
index
subject
was
randomized
to
1
)
control
or
2
)
surgical
face
masks
or
3
)
hand
hygiene
.

Households
were
visited
within
36
hours
,
and
3
,
6
and
9
days
later
.

Nose
and
throat
swabs
were
collected
from
index
subjects
and
all
household
contacts
at
each
home
visit
and
tested
by
viral
culture
.

The
primary
outcome
measure
was
laboratory
culture
confirmed
influenza
in
a
household
contact
;
the
secondary
outcome
was
clinically
diagnosed
influenza
(
by
self-reported
symptoms
)
.

We
randomized
198
households
and
completed
follow
up
home
visits
in
128
;
the
index
cases
in
122
of
those
households
had
laboratory-confirmed
influenza
.

There
were
21
household
contacts
with
laboratory
confirmed
influenza
corresponding
to
a
secondary
attack
ratio
of
6
%
.

Clinical
secondary
attack
ratios
varied
from
5
%
to
18
%
depending
on
case
definitions
.

The
laboratory-based
or
clinical
secondary
attack
ratios
did
not
significantly
differ
across
the
intervention
arms
.

Adherence
to
interventions
was
variable
.

Conclusions/Significance
:
The
secondary
attack
ratios
were
lower
than
anticipated
,
and
lower
than
reported
in
other
countries
,
perhaps
due
to
differing
patterns
of
susceptibility
,
lack
of
significant
antigenic
drift
in
circulating
influenza
virus
strains
recently
,
and/or
issues
related
to
the
symptomatic
recruitment
design
.

Lessons
learnt
from
this
pilot
have
informed
changes
for
the
main
study
in
2008

Viruses
are

recreationally-associated
waterborne
diseases
linked
to
pools
,
lakes
,
ponds

,

.

We
present
an
updated
overview
of
epidemiological
data
on
viral
outbreaks
,
a
project
motivated
,
among
other
things
,
by
the
availability
of
improved
viral
detection
methodologies
.

Special
attention
is
paid
to
outbreak
investigations
(
source
of
the
outbreak
,
pathways
of
transmission
,
chlorination/disinfection
)
.

Epidemiological
studies
on
incidents
of
viral
contamination
of
swimming
pools
under
non-epidemic
conditions
are
also
reviewed
.

In
2016
the
World
Health
Organization
identified
21
countries
that
could
eliminate
malaria
by
2020
.

Monitoring
progress
towards
this
goal
requires
tracking
ongoing
transmission
.

Here
we
develop
methods
that
estimate
individual
reproduction
numbers
and
their
variation
through
time
and
space
.

Individual
reproduction
numbers
,
R
c
,
describe
the
state
of
transmission
at
a
point
in
time
and
differ
from
mean
reproduction
numbers
,
which
are
averages
of
the
number
of
people
infected
by
a
typical
case
.

We
assess
elimination
progress
in
El
Salvador
using
data
for
confirmed
cases
of
malaria
from
2010
to
2016
.

Our
results
demonstrate
that
whilst
the
average
number
of
secondary
malaria
cases
was
below
one
(
0.61
,
95
%
CI
0.55-0.65
)
,
individual
reproduction
numbers
often
exceeded
one
.

We
estimate
a
decline
in
R
c
between
2010
and
2016
.

However
we
also
show
that
if
importation
is
maintained
at
the
same
rate
,
the
country
may
not
achieve
malaria
elimination
by
2020
.

Genetic
background
may
play
an
important

in
the
process
of
SARS-CoV

We
found
several
proteins
that
could
interact
with
the
nucleocapsid
protein
of
the
SARS
coronavirus
(
SARS-CoV
)
.

a-2-Heremans-Schmid
Glycoprotein
(
AHSG
)
,
which
is
required
for
macrophage
deactivation
by
endogenous
cations
,
is
associated
with
inflammatory
regulation
.

Cytochrome
P450
Family

(
CYP4F3A
)
is
an
v-oxidase
that
inactivates
Leukotriene
B4
(

)
in
human
neutrophils
and

.

We
investigated
the
association
between
the
polymorphisms
of
these
two
inflammationassociated
genes
and
SARS
development
.

The
linkage
disequilibrium
(

maps
of
these
two
genes
were
built
with
Haploview
using
data
on
CHB+JPT
(
version

)
from
the
HapMap
.

A
total
of
ten
tag

were
selected
and
genotyped
.

In
the
Guangzhou
cohort
study
,
after
adjusting
for
age
and
sex
,
two
AHSG
SNPs
and
one
CYP4F3
SNP
were
found
to
be
associated
with
SARS
susceptibility

.

To
further
validate
the
association
,
the
ten

were
genotyped
in
the
Beijing

.

After

,
only
rs2248690
(

was
found
to
be
associated
with
SARS

.

The
combined
analysis
of
the
two
studies
confirmed

SNP
rs2248690
in
AHSG
as
a
susceptibility
variant
(

.

The
statistical
analysis
of
the
rs2248690
genotype
data
among
the
patients
and
healthy
controls
in
the
HCW
cohort
,
who
were
all
similarly
exposed
to
the
SARS
virus
,
also
supported
the
findings
.

Further
,
the
SNP
rs2248690
affected
the
transcriptional
activity
of
the
AHSG
promoter
and
thus
regulated
the
AHSG
serum
level
.

Therefore
,
our
study
has
demonstrated
that
the
AA
genotype
of
rs2268690
,
which
leads
to
a
higher
AHSG
serum
concentration
,
was
significantly
associated
with
protection
against

and
designated

was
sequenced

.

Phylogenetic

identities

RNA
viruses
replicate
with
low
fidelity
due
to
the
error-prone
nature
of
the
RNA-dependent
RNA
polymerase
,
which
generates
approximately
one
mutation
per
round
of
genome
replication
.

Due
to
the
large
population
sizes
produced
by
RNA
viruses
during
replication
,
this
results
in
a
cloud
of
closely
related
virus
variants
during
host
infection
,
of
which
small
increases
or
decreases
in
replication
fidelity
have
been
shown
to
result
in
virus
attenuation
in
vivo
,
but
not
typically
in
vitro
.

Since
the
discovery
of
the
first
RNA
virus
fidelity
mutants
during
the
mid-aughts
,
the
field
has
exploded
with
the
identification
of
over
50
virus
fidelity
mutants
distributed
amongst
7
RNA
virus
families
.

This
review
summarizes
the
current
RNA
virus
fidelity
mutant
literature
,
with
a
focus
upon
the
definition
of
a
fidelity
mutant
as
well
as
methods
to
confirm
any
mutational
changes
associated
with
the
fidelity
mutant
.

Due
to
the
complexity
of
such
a
definition
,
in
addition
to
reports
of
unstable
virus
fidelity
phenotypes
,
the
future
translational
utility
of
these
mutants
and
applications
for
basic
science
are
examined

However
,
the
large
population
sizes
produced
during
the
rapid
population
growth
of
RNA
viruses
are
believed
to
result
in
an
overall
effective
strategy
for
swift
adaptation
to
changeable
environments
[
14
]
.

The
mutational
spectrum
for
an
RNA
virus
can
be
visualized
as
a
3D
field
,
with
multiple
peaks
and
valleys
representative
of
virus
fitness
(
Figure
1
)
.

The
virus
consensus
sequence
forms
the
foundation
of
the
fitness
landscape
,
allowing
the
virus
population
to
explore
this
landscape
through
genetic
drift
with
the
prospect
of
finding
and
climbing
new
fitness
peaks
[
15
]
.

This
landscape
is
not
fixed
but
changes
throughout
the
viral
lifecycle
,
with
the
magnitude
,
location
,
and
frequency
of
the
peaks
and
valleys
moving
through
both
time
and
space
[
13
,
16
]
.

Due
to
the
high
error
rates
produced
during
RNA
virus
replication
,
it
is
hypothesized
that
the
best
strategy
for
RNA
virus
survival
is
to
produce
a
sequence
foundation
composed
of
low
rolling
hills
,
termed
survival
of
the
flattest
[
17
,
18
]
.

Thus
,
mutations
away
from
the
consensus
sequence
should
not
have
large
,
detrimental
effects
as
the
sequence
space
is
explored
,
but
still
allow
for
the
virus
to
identify
fitness
peaks
to
aid
in
survival
during
an
unstable
environment
.

However
,
survival
is
not
guaranteed
,
and
the
mechanisms
that
allow
for
the
ubiquity
of
RNA
viruses
can
also
be
used
against
them
.

Background
:
Outbreaks
of
emerging
infectious
diseases
have
led
to
guidelines
recommending
the
routine
use
of
N95
respirators
for
healthcare
workers
,
many
of
whom
are
women
of
childbearing
age
.

The
respiratory
effects
of
prolonged
respirator
use
on
pregnant
women
are
unclear
although
there
has
been
no
definite
evidence
of
harm
from
past
use
.

We
conducted
a
two-phase
controlled
clinical
study
on
healthy
pregnant
women
between
27
to
32
weeks
gestation
.

In
phase
I
,
energy
expenditure
corresponding
to
the
workload
of
routine
nursing
tasks
was
determined
.

In
phase
II
,
pulmonary
function
of
20
subjects
was
measured
whilst
at
rest
and
exercising
to
the
predetermined
workload
while
breathing
ambient
air
first
,
then
breathing
through
N95-mask

.

Although
no
changes
in
the
inspired
oxygen
and
carbon

concentrations
were
demonstrated
,
breathing
through
N95-mask

suggesting
an
increase
in

There
were

and
oxygen

and
rating
of

at
the

investigated
.

Conclusions
:
Breathing
through
N95
mask
materials
have
been
shown
to
impede
gaseous
exchange
and
impose
an
additional
workload
on
the
metabolic
system
of
pregnant
healthcare
workers
,
and
this
needs
to
be
taken
into
consideration
in
guidelines
for
respirator
use
.

The
benefits
of
using
N95
mask
to
prevent
serious
emerging
infectious
diseases
should
be
weighed
against
potential
respiratory
consequences
associated
with
extended
N95
respirator
usage
.

Trial
Registration
:
The
study
was
registered
at
clinicaltrials.gov
,
identifier
NCT00265926
.

A
series
of
phenanthroquinolizidine
alkaloids
1-24
were
prepared
and
first
evaluated
for
their
antiviral
activity
against
tobacco
mosaic
virus
(
TMV
)
.

The
bioassay
results
showed
that
most
of
these
compounds
exhibited
good
to
excellent
in

anti-TMV
activity
,
of
which
compounds
1
,
2
,
15
and

displayed
significantly
higher
activity
than
(
R
)
-antofine
and
commercial
Ningnanmycin
at
the
same

.

The
substituents
on
the

moiety
play
an
important
role
for
maintaining
high

Fifty-nine

were
found
among

Background
:
Contacts
between
patients
,
patients
and
health
care
workers
(
HCWs
)
and
among
HCWs
represent
one
of
the
important
routes
of
transmission
of
hospital-acquired
infections
(
HAI
)
.

A
detailed
description
and
quantification
of
contacts
in
hospitals
provides
key
information
for
HAIs
epidemiology
and
for
the
design
and
validation
of
control
measures
.

Methods
and
Findings
:
We
used
wearable
sensors
to
detect
close-range
interactions
(
``
contacts
''
)
between
individuals
in
the
geriatric
unit
of
a
university
hospital
.

Contact
events
were
measured
with
a
spatial
resolution
of
about
1.5
meters
and
a
temporal
resolution
of
20
seconds
.

The
study
included
46
HCWs
and
29
patients
and
lasted
for
4
days
and
4
nights
.

14,037
contacts
were
recorded
overall
,
94.1
%
of
which
during
daytime
.

The
number
and
duration
of
contacts
varied
between
mornings
,
afternoons
and
nights
,
and
contact
matrices
describing
the
mixing
patterns
between
HCW
and
patients
were
built
for
each
time
period
.

Contact
patterns
were
qualitatively
similar
from
one
day
to
the
next
.

38
%
of
the
contacts
occurred
between
pairs
of
HCWs
and
6
HCWs
accounted
for
42
%
of
all
the
contacts
including
at
least
one
patient
,
suggesting
a
population
of
individuals
who
could
potentially
act
as
super-spreaders
.

Conclusions
:
Wearable
sensors
represent
a
novel
tool
for
the
measurement
of
contact
patterns
in
hospitals
.

The
collected
data
can
provide
information
on
important
aspects
that
impact
the
spreading
patterns
of
infectious
diseases
,
such
as
the
strong
heterogeneity
of
contact
numbers
and
durations
across
individuals
,
the
variability
in
the
number
of
contacts
during
a
day
,
and
the
fraction
of
repeated
contacts
across
days
.

This
variability
is
however
associated
with
a
marked
statistical
stability
of
contact
and
mixing
patterns
across
days
.

Our
results
highlight
the
need
for
such
measurement
efforts
in
order
to
correctly
inform
mathematical
models
of
HAIs
and
use
them
to
inform
the
design
and
evaluation
of
prevention
strategies
.

Objective
:
Finding
the
longest
common
subsequence
(
LCS
)
among
sequences
is
NP-hard
.

This
is
an
important
problem
in
bioinformatics
for
DNA
sequence
alignment
and
pattern
discovery
.

In
this
research
,
we
propose
new
CPU-based
parallel
implementations
that
can
provide
significant
advantages
in
terms
of
execution
times
,
monetary
cost
,
and
pervasiveness
in
finding
LCS
of
DNA
sequences
in
an
environment
where
Graphics
Processing
Units
are
not
available
.

For
general
purpose
use
,
we
also
make
the
OpenMP-based
tool
publicly
available
to
end
users
.

In
this
study
,
we
develop
three
novel
parallel
versions
of
the
LCS
algorithm
on
:
(
i
)
distributed
memory
machine
using
message
passing
interface
(
MPI
)
;
(
ii
)
shared
memory
machine
using
OpenMP
,
and
(
iii
)
hybrid
platform
that
utilizes
both
distributed
and
shared
memory
using
MPI-OpenMP
.

The
experimental
results
with
both
simulated
and
real
DNA
sequence
data
show
that
the
shared
memory
OpenMP
implementation
provides
at
least
two-times
absolute
speedup
than
the
best
sequential
version
of
the
algorithm
and
a
relative
speedup
of
almost
7
.

We
provide
a
detailed
comparison
of
the
execution
times
among
the
implementations
on
different
platforms
with
different
versions
of
the
algorithm
.

We
also
show
that
removing
branch
conditions
negatively
affects
the
performance
of
the
CPU-based
parallel
algorithm
on
OpenMP
platform
.

The
aim
of
the
study
is
to
identify
how
the
wearing
of
personal
protective
equipment
(
PPE
)
over
a
longer
period
of
time
under
different
temperature
conditions
affects
physical
performance
,
individual
feeling
,
power
of
concentration
and
error
ratio
.

Two
different
PPE
systems
are
compared
while
carrying
out
typical
laboratory
work
in
two
different
temperature
conditions
.

To
be
able
to
develop
adequate
working
conditions
for
future
laboratory
workers
in
high
security
laboratories
,
it
is
necessary
to
identify
previously
mentioned
parameters
as
well
as
indicators
that
duly
indicate
overload
and
error
ratio
.

Based
on
these
measurements
a
maximum
reasonable
working
time
under
given
circumstances
shall
be
established
.

The
study
is
conducted
within
the
framework
of
the
EU
project
``
European
Research
Infrastructure
on
Highly
Pathogenic
Agents
(
ERINHA
)
''
where
a
pan-European
solution
for
the
collection
of
pathogenic
samples
should
be
developed
.

Duchenne
and
Becker
muscular
dystrophy
severity
depends
upon
the
nature
and
location
of
the
DMD
gene
lesion
and
generally
correlates
with
the
dystrophin
open
reading
frame
.

However
,
there
are
striking
exceptions
where
an
in-frame
genomic
deletion
leads
to
severe
pathology
or
protein-truncating
mutations
(
nonsense
or
frame-shifting
indels
)
manifest
as
mild
disease
.

Exceptions
to
the
dystrophin
reading
frame
rule
are
usually
resolved
after
molecular
diagnosis
on
muscle
RNA
.

We
report
a
moderate/severe
Becker
muscular
dystrophy
patient
with
an
in-frame
genomic
deletion
of
DMD
exon
5
.

This
mutation
has
been
reported
by
others
as
resulting
in
Duchenne
or
Intermediate
muscular
dystrophy
,
and
the
loss
of
this
in-frame
exon
in
one
patient
led
to
multiple
splicing
events
,
including
omission
of
exon
6
,
that
disrupts
the
open
reading
frame
and
is
consistent
with
a
severe
phenotype
.

The
patient
described
has
a
deletion
of
dystrophin
exon
5
that
does
not
compromise
recognition
of
exon
6
,
and
although
the
deletion
does
not
disrupt
the
reading
frame
,
his
clinical
presentation
is
more
severe
than
would
be
expected
for
classical
Becker
muscular
dystrophy
.

We
suggest
that
the
dystrophin
isoform
lacking
the
actin-binding
sequence
encoded
by
exon
5
is
compromised
,
reflected
by
the
phenotype
resulting
from
induction
of
this
dystrophin
isoform
in
mouse
muscle
in
vivo
.

Hence
,
exon
skipping
to
address
DMD-causing
mutations
within
DMD
exon
5
may
not
yield
an
isoform
that
confers
marked
clinical
benefit
.

Additional
studies
will
be
required
to
determine
whether
multi-exon
skipping
strategies
could
yield
more
functional
dystrophin
isoforms
,
since
some
BMD
patients
with
larger
inframe
deletions
in
this
region
have
been
reported
with
mild
phenotypes
.

Background
:
Toxoplasma
gondii
may
cause
abortions
,
ocular
and
neurological
disorders
in
warm-blood
hosts
.

Immunized
mammals
are
a
wide
source
of
hyperimmune
sera
used
in
different
approaches
,
including
diagnosis
and
the
study
of
hostparasite
interactions
.

Unfortunately
,
mammalian
antibodies
present
limitations
for
its
production
,
such
as
the
necessity
for
animal
bleeding
,
low
yield
,
interference
with
rheumatoid
factor
,
complement
activation
and
affinity
to
Fc
mammalian
receptors
.

IgY
antibodies
avoid
those
limitations
;
therefore
they
could
be
an
alternative
to
be
applied
in
T.
gondii
model
.

In
this
study
we
immunized
hens
with
soluble
tachyzoite
antigens
of
T.
gondii
(
STAg
)
and
purified
egg
yolk
antibodies
(
IgY
)
by
an
inexpensive
and
simple
method
,
with
high
yield
and
purity
degree
.

IgY
anti-STAg
antibodies
presented
high
avidity
and
were
able
to
recognize
a
broad
range
of
parasite
antigens
,
although
some
marked
differences
were
observed
in
reactivity
profile
between
antibodies
produced
in
immunized
hens
and
mice
.

Interestingly
,
IgY
antibodies
against
Neospora
caninum
and
Eimeria
spp
.

did
not
react
to
STAg
.

We
also
show
that
IgY
antibodies
were
suitable
to
detect
T.
gondii
forms
in
paraffin-embedded
sections
and
culture
cell
monolayers
.

Conclusions/Significance
:
Due
to
its
cost-effectiveness
,
high
production
yield
and
varied
range
of
possible
applications
,
polyclonal
IgY
antibodies
are
useful
tools
for
studies
involving
T.
gondii
.

Background
and
objectives
:
In
addition
to
conventional
healthcare
,
Ebola
survivors
are
known
to
seek
traditional
and
complementary
healthcare
(
T
&
CM
)
options
to
meet
their
healthcare
needs
.

However
,
little
is
known
about
the
general
beliefs
of
Ebola
survivors
regarding
T
&
CM
and
the
impact
of
these
beliefs
in
influencing
their
decisions
around
T
&
CM
use
.

This
study
examines
Ebola
survivors
'
attitudes
towards
T
&
CM
use
in
Sierra
Leone
.

Materials
and
Methods
:
We
conducted
a
nationwide
quantitative
cross-sectional
study
of
358
Ebola
survivors
in
Sierra
Leone
between
January
and
August
2018
.

We
used
descriptive
analysis
,
chi-square
tests
and
backward
stepwise
binary
logistic
regression
for
data
analysis
.

Results
:
Close
to
half
of
the
survivors
(
n
=
163
,
45.5
%
)
had
used
T
&
CM
since
their
discharge
from
an
Ebola
treatment
centre
.

Survivors
who
viewed
T
&
CM
as
boosting
their
immune
system/resistance
were
3.89
times
(

than
those
who
did
not
view
T

as
boosting
their

.

Additionally
,
survivors
who
viewed
T

CM
as
having
fewer
side
effects
than
conventional
medicine
were

.

Ebola

based
on
their
personal
experience
of
the

who
perceived
T

as
providing
them
with
more

as
opposed
to

.

Conclusions
:
Considering
the
widespread
use
of
T
&
CM
,
an
understanding
of
Ebola
survivors
'
attitudes/beliefs
towards
T
&
CM
is
useful
to
healthcare
providers
and
policymakers
with
regard
to
public
education
and
practitioner-survivors
communication
,
T
&
CM
regulation
and
research
in
Sierra
Leone
.

Ebola
survivors
appear
to
turn
to
T
&
CM
not
only
for
treatment
,
but
also
to
fill
gaps
in
conventional
health
care
services
.

Primary
human
airway
epithelial
cell
(
hAEC
)
cultures
represent
a
universal
platform
to
propagate
respiratory
viruses
and
characterize
their
host
interactions
in
authentic
target
cells
.

To
further
elucidate
specific
interactions
between
human
respiratory
viruses
and
important
host
factors
in
the
airway
epithelium
,
it
is
important
to
make
hAEC
cultures
amenable
to
genetic
modification
.

However
,
the
short
and
finite
lifespan
of
primary
cells
in
cell
culture
creates
a
bottleneck
for
the
genetic
modification
of
these
cultures
.

In
the
current
study
,
we
show
that
the
incorporation
of
the
Rho-associated
protein
kinase
(
ROCK
)
inhibitor
(
Y-27632
)
during
cell
propagation
extends
the
life
span
of
primary
human
cells
in
vitro
and
thereby
facilitates
the
incorporation
of
lentivirus-based
expression
systems
.

Using
fluorescent
reporters
for
fluorescence-activated
cell
sorting
(
FACS
)
-based
sorting
,
we
generated
homogenously
fluorescent
hAEC
cultures
that
differentiate
normally
after
lentiviral
transduction
.

As
a
proof-of-principle
,
we
demonstrate
that
host
gene
expression
can
be
modulated
post-differentiation
via
inducible
short
hairpin
(
sh
)
RNA-mediated
knockdown
.

Importantly
,
functional
characterization
of
these
transgenic
hAEC
cultures
with
exogenous
poly
(
I
:
C
)
,
as
a
proxy
for
virus
infection
,
demonstrates
that
such
modifications
do
not
influence
the
host
innate
immune
response
.

Moreover
,
the
propagation
kinetics
of
both
human
coronavirus
229E
(
HCoV-229E
)
and
human
respiratory
syncytial
virus
(
hRSV
)
were
not
affected
.

Combined
,
these
results
validate
our
newly
established
protocol
for
the
genetic
modification
of
hAEC
cultures
,
thereby
unlocking
a
unique
potential
for
detailed
molecular
characterization
of
virus-host
interactions
in
human
respiratory
epithelium
.

Background
:
In
May
2003
the
Soest
County
Health
Department
was
informed
of
an
unusually
large
number
of
patients
hospitalized
with
atypical
pneumonia
.

In
exploratory
interviews
patients
mentioned
having
visited
a
farmers
'
market
where
a
sheep
had
lambed
.

Serologic
testing
confirmed
the
diagnosis
of
Q
fever
.

We
asked
local
health
departments
in
Germany
to
identiy
notified
Q
fever
patients
who
had
visited
the
farmers
market
.

To
investigate
risk
factors
for
infection
we
conducted
a
case
control
study
(
cases
were
Q
fever
patients
,
controls
were
randomly
selected
Soest
citizens
)
and
a
cohort
study
among
vendors
at
the
market
.

The
sheep
exhibited
at
the
market
,
the
herd
from
which
it
originated
as
well
as
sheep
from
herds
held
in
the
vicinity
of
Soest
were
tested
for
Coxiella
burnetii
(
C.
burnetii
)
.

Results
:
A
total
of
299
reported
Q
fever
cases
was
linked
to
this
outbreak
.

The
mean
incubation
period
was
21
days
,
with
an
interquartile
range
of
16-24
days
.

The
case
control
study
identified
close
proximity
to
and
stopping
for
at
least
a
few
seconds
at
the
sheep
's
pen
as
significant
risk
factors
.

Vendors
within
approximately
6
meters
of
the
sheep
's
pen
were
at
increased
risk
for
disease
compared
to
those
located
farther
away
.

Wind
played
no
significant
role
.

The
clinical
attack
rate
of
adults
and
children
was
estimated
as
20
%
and
3
%
,
respectively
,
25
%
of
cases
were
hospitalized
.

The
ewe
that
had
lambed
as
well
as
25
%
of
its
herd
tested
positive
for
C.
burnetii
antibodies
.

Conclusion
:
Due
to
its
size
and
point
source
nature
this
outbreak
permitted
assessment
of
fundamental
,
but
seldom
studied
epidemiological
parameters
.

As
a
consequence
of
this
outbreak
,
it
was
recommended
that
pregnant
sheep
not
be
displayed
in
public
during
the
3
rd
trimester
and
to
test
animals
in
petting
zoos
regularly
for
C.
burnetii

Background
:
The
professionalism
of
hospital
workers
in
Japan
was
challenged
by
the
pandemic
(
H1N1
)
2009
.

To
maintain
hospital
function
under
critical
situations
such
as
a
pandemic
,
it
is
important
to
understand
the
factors
that
increase
and
decrease
the
willingness
to
work
.

Previous
hospital-based
studies
have
examined
this
question
using
hypothetical
events
,
but
so
far
it
has
not
been
examined
in
an
actual
pandemic
.

Here
,
we
surveyed
the
factors
that
influenced
the
motivation
and
hesitation
of
hospital
workers
to
work
in
Japan
soon
after
the
pandemic
(
H1N1
)
2009
.

Methods
:
Self-administered
anonymous
questionnaires
about
demographic
character
and
stress
factors
were
distributed
to
all
3635
employees
at
three
core
hospitals
in
Kobe
city
,
Japan
and
were
collected
from
June
to
July
,
2009
,
about
one
month
after
the
pandemic
(
H1N1
)
in
Japan
.

Results
:
Of
a
total
of
3635
questionnaires
distributed
,
1693
(
46.7
%
)
valid
questionnaires
were
received
.

28.4
%
(
N
=
481
)
of
workers
had
strong
motivation
and
14.7
%
(
N
=
249
)
had
strong
hesitation
to
work
.

Demographic
characters
and
stress-related
questions
were
categorised
into
four
types
according
to
the
odds
ratios
(
OR
)
of
motivation
and
hesitation
to
work
:
some
factors
increased
motivation
and
lowered
hesitation
;
others
increased
motivation
only
;
others
increased
hesitation
only
and
others
increased
both
motivation
and
hesitation
.

The
strong
feeling
of
being
supported
by
the
national
and
local
governments
(
Multivariate
OR
:
motivation
;
3.5
;
CI
2.2-5.4
,
hesitation

)
and
being
protected
by
hospital
(

2.8
;
CI
2.2-3.7
,

;
0.5
;
CI
0.3-0.7
)
were
related
to
higher
motivation
and
lower
hesitation
.

Here
,
protection
included
taking
precautions
to
prevent
illness
among
workers
and
their
families
,
providing
for
the
care
of
those
who
do
become
ill
,
reducing
malpractice
threats
,
and
financial
support
for
families
of
workers
who
die
on
duty
.

But
94.1
%
of
the
respondents
answered
protection
by
the
national
and
local
government
was
weak
and
79.7
%
answered
protection
by
the
hospital
was
weak
.

Conclusions
:
Some
factors
have
conflicting
effects
because
they
increase
both
motivation
and
hesitation
.

Giving
workers
the
feeling
that
they
are
being
protected
by
the
national
and
local
government
and
hospital
is
especially
valuable
because
it
increases
their
motivation
and
lowers
their
hesitation
to
work
.

The
Interferon
induced
transmembrane
proteins
(
IFITM
)
are
a
family
of
transmembrane
proteins
that
is
known
to
inhibit
cell
invasion
of
viruses
such
as
HIV-1
and
influenza
.

We
show
that
the
IFITM
genes
are
a
subfamily
in
a
larger
family
of
transmembrane
(
TM
)
proteins
that
we
call
Dispanins
,
which
refers
to
a
common
2TM
structure
.

We
mined
the
Dispanins
in
36
eukaryotic
species
,
covering
all
major
eukaryotic
groups
,
and
investigated
their
evolutionary
history
using
Bayesian
and
maximum
likelihood
approaches
to
infer
a
phylogenetic
tree
.

We
identified
ten
human
genes
that
together
with
the
known
IFITM
genes
form
the
Dispanin
family
.

We
show
that
the
Dispanins
first
emerged
in
eukaryotes
in
a
common
ancestor
of
choanoflagellates
and
metazoa
,
and
that
the
family
later
expanded
in
vertebrates
where
it
forms
four
subfamilies
(
A-D
)
.

Interestingly
,
we
also
find
that
the
family
is
found
in
several
different
phyla
of
bacteria
and
propose
that
it
was
horizontally
transferred
to
eukaryotes
from
bacteria
in
the
common
ancestor
of
choanoflagellates
and
metazoa
.

The
bacterial
and
eukaryotic
sequences
have
a
considerably
conserved
protein
structure
.

In
conclusion
,
we
introduce
a
novel
family
,
the
Dispanins
,
together
with
a
nomenclature
based
on
the
evolutionary
origin
.

Since
its
emergence
in
2012
,
2,260
cases
and
803
deaths
due

MERS-CoV
)
have
been
reported
to
the
World

.

Most
cases
were
due
to
transmission
in
healthcare
settings
,
sometimes
causing
large
outbreaks
.

We
analyzed
epidemiologic
and
clinical

of
laboratory-confirmed
MERS-CoV
cases
from
eleven
healthcare-associated

in
the
Kingdom
of
Saudi
Arabia
and
the
Republic
of
Korea
between
2015-2017
.

We
quantified
key
epidemiological
differences
between
outbreaks
.

Twenty-five
percent
(
n

105/422
)
of
MERS
cases
who
acquired
infection
in
a

was

.

At
the
start
of
these
outbreaks
,
the
reproduction

ranged
from
1.0
to
5.7
;
it
dropped
below

This
study
provides
a
comprehensive
characterization
of
MERS
HCA-outbreaks
.

Our
results
highlight
heterogeneities
in
the
epidemiological
profile
of
healthcareassociated
outbreaks
.

The
limitations
of
our
study
stress
the
urgent
need
for
standardized
data
collection
for
high-threat
respiratory
pathogens
,
such
as
MERS-CoV
.

its
emergence
in

,
the
Middle

pattern
derived
from
virions
and
intracellular
stress

involved

lead
to

However

underlying

Type-I
interferons
(
IFN-I
)
are
cytokines
essential
for
vertebrate
antiviral
defense
,
including
against
herpesviruses
.

IFN-I
have
potent
direct
antiviral
activities
and
also
mediate
a
multiplicity
of
immunoregulatory
functions
,
which
can
either
promote
or
dampen
antiviral
adaptive
immune
responses
.

Plasmacytoid
dendritic
cells
(
pDCs
)
are
the
professional
producers
of
IFN-I
in
response
to
many
viruses
,
including
all
of
the
herpesviruses
tested
.

There
is
strong
evidence
that
pDCs
could
play
a
major
role
in
the
initial
orchestration
of
both
innate
and
adaptive
antiviral
immune
responses
.

Depending
on
their
activation
pattern
,
pDC
responses
may
be
either
protective
or
detrimental
to
the
host
.

Here
,
we
summarize
and
discuss
current
knowledge
regarding
pDC
implication
in
the
physiopathology
of
mouse
and
human
herpesvirus
infections
,
and
we
discuss
how
pDC
functions
could
be
manipulated
in
immunotherapeutic
settings
to
promote
health
over
disease
.

Viruses
2009
,

Several
viruses
encode
factors
that
promote
host
mRNA
degradation
to
silence
gene
expression
.

It
is
unclear
,
however
,
whether
cellular
mRNA
turnover
pathways
are
engaged
to
assist
in
this
process
.

In
Kaposi
's
sarcoma-associated
herpesvirus
this
phenotype
is
enacted
by
the
host
shutoff
factor
SOX
.

Here
we
show
that
SOX-induced
mRNA
turnover
is
a
two-step
process
,
in
which
mRNAs
are
first
cleaved
internally
by
SOX
itself
then
degraded
by
the
cellular
exonuclease
Xrn1
.

SOX
therefore
bypasses
the
regulatory
steps
of
deadenylation
and
decapping
normally
required
for
Xrn1
activation
.

SOX
is
likely
recruited
to
translating
mRNAs
,
as
it
cosediments
with
translation
initiation
complexes
and
depletes
polysomes
.

Cleaved
mRNA
intermediates
accumulate
in
the
40S
fraction
,
indicating
that
recognition
occurs
at
an
early
stage
of
translation
.

This
is
the
first
example
of
a
viral
protein
commandeering
cellular
mRNA
turnover
pathways
to
destroy
host
mRNAs
,
and
suggests
that
Xrn1
is
poised
to
deplete
messages
undergoing
translation
in
mammalian
cells
.

Herpes
simplex
virus
type
1
(
HSV-1
)
,
an
enveloped
DNA
virus
,
plays
a
key
role
in
varieties
of
diseases
including
recurrent
cold
sores
,
keratoconjunctivitis
,
genital
herpes
and
encephalitis
in
humans
.

Great
efforts
have
been
made
in
developing
more
effective
and
less
side-effects
anti-herpes
simplex
virus
agents
,
including
traditional
Chinese
herbal
medicines
.

In
the
present
study
,
we
evaluated
the
antiviral
efficacy
of
Rheum
tanguticum
nanoparticles
against
HSV-1
in
vitro
and
in
vivo
.

R.
tanguticum
nanoparticles
could
inactivate
the
HSV-1
virions
and
block
the
viral
attachment
and
entry
into
cells
.

Time-ofaddition
assay
indicated
that
R.
tanguticum
nanoparticles
could
interfere
with
the
entire
phase
of
viral
replication
.

Besides
,
R.
tanguticum
nanoparticles
showed
the
ability
to
inhibit
the
mRNA
expression
of
HSV-1
immediate
early
gene
ICP4
and
early
gene
ICP8
as
well
as
the
expression
of
viral
protein
ICP4
and
ICP8
.

Moreover
,
R.
tanguticum
nanoparticles
have
been
proved
to
protect
mice
against
HSV-1
induced
lethality
by
decreasing
the
viral
load
and
alleviated
pathological
changes
in
brain
tissues
.

In
conclusion
,
we
demonstrated
that
R.
tanguticum
nanoparticles
could
inhibit
HSV-1
infection
through
multiple
mechanisms
.

These
results
suggest
that
R.
tanguticum
nanoparticles
may
have
novel
roles
in
the
treatment
of
HSV-1
infection
.

Background
:
Non-severe
acute
respiratory
syndrome
(
non-SARS
)
-related
human
coronaviruses
(
HCoVs
)
,
including
HCoV-229E
,
-HKU1
,
-NL63
,
and
-OC43
,
have
been
detected
in
respiratory
tract
samples
from
children
and
adults
.

However
,
the
natural
prevalence
of
antibodies
against
these
viruses
in
serum
among
population
is
unknown
.

Methods
:
To
measure
antibodies
to
the
spike
(
S
)
protein
of
the
four
common
non-SARS
HCoVs
,
recombinant
S
proteins
of
the
four
HCoVs
were
expressed
and
characterised
in
293
T
cell
.

An
S-protein-based
indirect
immunofluorescence
assay
(
IFA
)
was
then
developed
to
detect
anti-S
IgG
and
IgM
for
the
four
individual
HCoVs
and
applied
to
serum
samples
from
a
general
asymptomatic
population
(
218
children
and
576
adults
)
in
Beijing
.

Results
:
Of
794
blood
samples
tested
,
only
29
(
3.65
%
)
were
negative
for
anti-S
IgG
.

The
seropositivity
of
the
four
anti-S
IgG
antibodies
was
>
70
%
within
the
general
population
.

The
majority
of
seroconversions
to
four-HCoV
positivity
first
occurred
in
children
.

Both
S-IgG
and
S-IgM
antibodies
were
detectable
among
children
and
increased
with
age
,
reaching
a
plateau
at
6
years
of
age
.

However
,
no
anti-S
IgM
was
detected
in
healthy
adults
.

Conclusion
:
Large
proportions
of
children
and
adults
in
Beijing
have
evidence
of
anti-S
IgG
against
four
the
HCoVs
,
and
first

structures
that
elicit

,
which
block
critical

important

,
represent
a
means
for

.

By
using
bioinformatics
algorithms
,
a
total
of
50
antigens
with
a-helical
coiled
coil
motifs
orthologous
to
Plasmodium
falciparum
were
identified
in
the
P.
vivax
genome
.

The
peptides
identified
in
silico
were
chemically
synthesized
;
circular
dichroism
studies
indicated
partial
or
high
a-helical
content
.

Antigenicity
was
evaluated
using
human
sera
samples
from
malaria-endemic
areas
of
Colombia
and
Papua
New
Guinea
.

Eight
of
these
fragments
were
selected
and
used
to
assess
immunogenicity
in
BALB/c
mice
.

ELISA
assays
indicated
strong
reactivity
of
serum
samples
from
individuals
residing
in
malaria-endemic
regions
and
sera
of
immunized
mice
,
with
the
ahelical
coiled
coil
structures
.

In
addition
,
ex
vivo
production
of
IFN-c
by
murine
mononuclear
cells
confirmed
the
immunogenicity
of
these
structures
and
the
presence
of
T-cell
epitopes
in
the
peptide
sequences
.

Moreover
,
sera
of
mice
immunized
with
four
of
the
eight
antigens
recognized
native
proteins
on
blood-stage
P.
vivax
parasites
,
and
antigenic
crossreactivity
with
three
of
the
peptides
was
observed
when
reacted
with
both
the
P.
falciparum
orthologous
fragments
and
whole
parasites
.

Results
here
point
to
the
a-helical
coiled
coil
peptides
as
possible
P.
vivax
malaria
vaccine
candidates
as
were
observed
for
P.
falciparum
.

Fragments
selected
here
warrant
further
study
in
humans
and
non-human
primate
models
to
assess
their
protective
efficacy
as
single

and
,
more

.

Several
chemotypes
of
small
molecules
,
including
heteroaryldihydropyrimidines
(
HAPs
)
and
sulfamoylbenzamides
(
SBAs
)
,
have
been
discovered
to
allosterically
modulate
core
protein
structure
and
consequentially
alter
the
kinetics
and
pathway
of
core
protein
assembly
,
resulting
in
formation
of
irregularly-shaped
core
protein
aggregates
or
``
empty
''
capsids
devoid
of
pre-genomic
RNA
and
viral
DNA
polymerase
.

Interestingly
,
in
addition
to
inhibiting
nucleocapsid
assembly
and
subsequent
viral
genome
replication
,
we
have
now
demonstrated
that
HAPs
and
SBAs
differentially
modulate
the
biosynthesis
of
covalently
closed
circular
(
ccc
)
DNA
from
de
novo
infection
and
intracellular
amplification
pathways
by
inducing
disassembly
of
nucleocapsids
derived
from
virions
as
well
as
double-stranded
DNA-containing
progeny
nucleocapsids
in
the
cytoplasm
.

Specifically
,
the
mistimed
cuing
of
nucleocapsid
uncoating
prevents
cccDNA
formation
during
de
novo
infection
of
hepatocytes
,
while
transiently
accelerating
cccDNA
synthesis
from
cytoplasmic
progeny
nucleocapsids
.

Our
studies
indicate
that
elongation
of
positive-stranded
DNA
induces
structural
changes
of
nucleocapsids
,
which
confers
ability
of
mature
nucleocapsids
to
bind
CpAMs
and
triggers
its
disassembly
.

Understanding
the

underlying
the
dual
effects
of
the
core
protein
allosteric
modulators
on
nucleocapsid
assembly
and
disassembly
will
facilitate
the
discovery
of
novel

agents
that
can
more
efficiently
suppress

Persistent

.

The
currently
available

fail
to
cure
chronic

due
to
their
failure
to

In

We

an
intriguing
observation
that

Bovine
viral
diarrhoea
virus
1
(
BVDV-1
)
is
strongly
associated
with
several
important
diseases
of
cattle
,
such
as
bovine
respiratory
disease
,
diarrhoea
and
haemoragic
lesions
.

To
date
many
subgenotypes
have
been
reported
for
BVDV-1
,
currently
ranging
from
subgenotype
1a
to
subgenotype
1u
.

While
BVDV-1
has
a
world-wide
distribution
,
the
subgenotypes
have
a
more
restricted
geographical
distribution
.

As
an
example
,
BVDV-1
subgenotypes
1a
and
1b
are
frequently
detected
in
North
America
and
Europe
,
while
the
subgenotype
1c
is
rarely
detected
.

In
contrast
,
BVDV-1
subgenotype
1c
is
by
far
the
most
commonly
reported
in
Australia
.

Despite
this
,
uneven
distribution
of
the
biological
importance
of
the
subgenotypes
remains
unclear
.

The
aim
of
this
study
was
to
characterise
the
in
vivo
properties
of
five
strains
of
BVDV-1
subgenotype
1c
in
cattle
infection
studies
.

No
overt
respiratory
signs
were
reported
in
any
of
the
infected
cattle
regardless
of
strain
.

Consistent
with
other
subgenotypes
,
transient
pyrexia
and
leukopenia
were
commonly
identified
,
while
thrombocytopenia
was
not
.

The
quantity
of
virus
detected
in
the
nasal
secretions
of
transiently
infected
animals
suggested
the
likelihood
of
horizontal
transmission
was
very
low
.

Further
studies
are
required
to
fully
understand
the
variability
and
importance
of
the
BVDV-1
subgenotype
1c
.

There
are
219
virus
species
that
are
known
to
be
able
to
infect
humans
.

The
first
of
these
to
be
discovered
was
yellow
fever
virus
in
1901
,
and
three
to
four
new
species
are
still
being
found
every
year
.

Extrapolation
of
the
discovery
curve
suggests
that
there
is
still
a
substantial
pool
of
undiscovered
human
virus
species
,
although
an
apparent
slow-down
in
the
rate
of
discovery
of
species
from
different
families
may
indicate
bounds
to
the
potential
range
of
diversity
.

More
than
two-thirds
of
human
viruses
can
also
infect
non-human
hosts
,
mainly
mammals
,
and
sometimes
birds
.

Many
specialist
human
viruses
also
have
mammalian
or
avian
origins
.

Indeed
,
a
substantial
proportion
of
mammalian
viruses
may
be
capable
of
crossing
the
species
barrier
into
humans
,
although
only
around
half
of
these
are
capable
of
being
transmitted
by
humans
and
around
half
again
of
transmitting
well
enough
to
cause
major
outbreaks
.

A
few
possible
predictors
of
species
jumps
can
be
identified
,
including
the
use
of
phylogenetically
conserved
cell
receptors
.

It
seems
almost
inevitable
that
new
human
viruses
will
continue
to
emerge
,
mainly
from
other
mammals
and
birds
,
for
the
foreseeable
future
.

For
this
reason
,
an
effective
global
surveillance
system
for
novel
viruses
is
needed
.

Background
:
Felid

causes
upper

diseases
in
cats
worldwide
,
including
nasal
and
ocular
discharge
,
conjunctivitis
and
oral
ulceration
.

The
nature
and
severity
of
disease
can
vary
between
clinical
cases
.

Genetic
determinants
of
virulence
are
likely
to
contribute
to
differences
in
the
in
vivo
phenotype
of
FHV-1
isolates
,
but
to
date
there
have
been
limited
studies
investigating
FHV-1
genetic
diversity

This
study
used
next
generation
sequencing
to
compare
the
genomes
of
contemporary
Australian
clinical
isolates
of
FHV-1
,
vaccine
isolates
and
historical
clinical
isolates
,
including
isolates
that
predated
the
introduction
of
live
attenuated
vaccines
into
Australia
.

Analysis
of
the
genome
sequences
aimed
to
assess
the
level
of
genetic
diversity
,
identify
potential
genetic
markers
that
could
influence
the
in
vivo
phenotype
of
the
isolates
and
examine
the
sequences
for
evidence
of
recombination
.

Results
:
The
full
genome
sequences
of
26
isolates
of
FHV-1
were
determined
,
including
two
vaccine
isolates
and
24
clinical
isolates
that
were
collected
over
a
period
of
approximately
40
years
.

Analysis
of
the
genome
sequences
revealed
a
remarkably
low
level
of
diversity
(
0.0-0.01
%
)
between
the
isolates
.

No
potential
genetic
determinants
of
virulence
were
identified
,
but
unique
single
nucleotide
polymorphisms
(
SNPs
)
in
the
UL28
and
UL44
genes
were
detected
in
the
vaccine
isolates
that
were
not
present
in
the
clinical
isolates
.

No
evidence
of
FHV-1
recombination
was
detected
using
multiple
methods
of
recombination
detection
,
even
though
many
of
the
isolates
originated
from
cats
housed
in
a
shelter
environment
where
high
infective
pressures
were
likely
to
exist
.

Evidence
of
displacement
of
dominant
FHV-1
isolates
with
other
(
genetically
distinct
)
FHV-1
isolates
over
time
was
observed
amongst
the
isolates
obtained
from
the
shelter-housed
animals
.

The
results
show
that
FHV-1
genomes
are
highly
conserved
.

The
lack
of
recombination
detected
in
the
FHV-1
genomes
suggests
that
the
risk
of
attenuated
vaccines
recombining
to
generate
virulent
field
viruses
is
lower
than
has
been
suggested
for
some
other
herpesviruses
.

The
SNPs
detected
only
in
the
vaccine
isolates
offer
the
potential
to
develop
PCR-based
methods
of
differentiating
vaccine
and
clinical
isolates
of
FHV-1
in
order
to
facilitate
future
epidemiological
studies
.

Affinity
maturation
is
the
process
whereby
the
immune
system
generates
antibodies
of
higher
affinities
during
a
response
to
antigen
.

It
is
unique
in
being
the
only
evolutionary
mechanism
known
to
operate
on
a
molecule
in
an
organism
's
own
body
.

Deciphering
the
structural
mechanisms
through
which
somatic
mutations
in
antibody
genes
increase
affinity
is
critical
to
understanding
the
evolution
of
immune
repertoires
.

Next-generation
sequencing
(
NGS
)
has
allowed
the
reconstruction
of
antibody
clonal
lineages
in
response
to
viral
pathogens
,
such
as
HIV-1
,
which
was
not
possible
in
earlier
studies
of
affinity
maturation
.

Crystal
structures
of
antibodies
from
these
lineages
bound
to
their
target
antigens
have
revealed
,
at
the
atomic
level
,
how
antibodies
evolve
to
penetrate
the
glycan
shield
of
envelope
glycoproteins
,
and
how
viruses
in
turn
evolve
to
escape
neutralization
.

Collectively
,
structural
studies
of
affinity
maturation
have
shown
that
increased
antibody
affinity
can
arise
from
any
one
or
any
combination
of
multiple
diverse
mechanisms
,
including
improved
shape
complementarity
at
the
interface
with
antigen
,
increased
buried
surface
area
upon
complex
formation
,
additional
interfacial
polar
or
hydrophobic
interactions
,
and
preorganization
or
rigidification
of
the
antigenbinding
site

Griffithsin
(
GRFT
)
,
a
lectin
from
Griffithsia
species
,
inhibits
human
immunodeficiency
virus-1
(
HIV-1
)
replication
at
sub-nanomolar
concentrations
,
with
limited
cellular
toxicity
.

However
,
in
vivo
safety
of
GRFT
is
not
fully
understood
,
especially
following
parenteral
administration
.

We
first
assessed
GRFT
's
effects
in
vitro
,
on
mouse
peripheral
blood
mononuclear
cell
(
mPBMC
)
viability
,
mitogenicity
,
and
activation
using
flow-cytometry
,
as
well
as
cytokine
secretion
through
enzyme-linked
immunosorbent
assay
(
ELISA
)
.

Toxicological
properties
of
GRFT
were
determined
after
a
single
subcutaneous
administration
of
50
mg/kg
or
14
daily
doses
of
10
mg/kg
in
BALB/c
mice
.

In
the
context
of
microbicide
development
,
toxicity
of
GRFT
at
2
mg/kg
was
determined
after
subcutaneous
,
intravaginal
,
and
intraperitoneal
administrations
,
respectively
.

Interestingly
,
GRFT
caused
no
significant
cell
death
,
mitogenicity
,
activation
,
or
cytokine
release
in
mPBMCs
,
validating
the
usefulness
of
a
mouse
model
.

An
excellent
safety
profile
for
GRFT
was
obtained
in
vivo
:
no
overt
changes
were
observed
in
animal
fitness
,
blood
chemistry
or
CBC
parameters
.

Following
GRFT
treatment
,
reversible
splenomegaly
was
observed
with
activation
of
certain
spleen
B
and
T
cells
.

However
,
spleen
tissues
were
not
pathologically
altered
by
GRFT
(
either
with
a
single
high
dose
or
chronic
doses
)
.

Finally
,
no
detectable
toxicity
was
found
after
mucosal
or
systemic
treatment
with
2
mg/kg
GRFT
,
which
should
be
further
developed
as
a
microbicide
for
HIV
prevention
.

Rapid
development
in
polymerase
chain
reaction
(
PCR
)
technology
has
revolutionised
the
speed
and
accuracy
of
many
diagnostic
assays
.

However
,
comparatively
few
wildlife
epidemiological
studies
use
quantitative
PCR
(
qPCR
)
for
pathogen
detection
,
even
fewer
employ
an
internal
control
,
to
ensure
confidence
in
negative
results
,
and
PCR
's
ability
to
multiplex
and
therefore
detect
several
targets
in
a
single
reaction
is
underutilised
.

Here
,
we
describe
the
development
of
two
multiplex
qPCR
assays
for
the
red
and
grey
squirrel
that
detect
the
pathogens
squirrelpox
virus
(
SQPV
)
and
adenovirus
in
squirrels
(
SADV
)
,
both
of
which
cause
mortality
in
the
red
squirrel
.

Both
assays
use
a
section
of
the
squirrel
phosphoglycerate
kinase
gene
as
an
endogenous
internal
control
that
identifies
and
compensates
for
both
,
inadequate
sampling
or
PCR
inhibition
.

Tests
on
infected
squirrel
tissue
demonstrate
that
simple
swab
samples
(
particularly
from
distal
antebrachial
skin
)
are
sufficient
to
detect
and
identify
the
relative
quantity
of
SQPV
DNA
in
both
squirrel
species
,
while
rectal
swabs
and
blood
cell
pellets
can
be
used
to
reliably
indicate
SADV
infection
.

These
assays
are
sensitive
and
specific
with
an
endogenous
internal
control
providing
confidence
in
negative
results
and
allowing
comparison
across
laboratories
.

Using
such
assays
should
prove
advantageous
in
wildlife
studies
with
limited
resources
while
allowing
the
maximum
data
yield
.

The
ongoing
COVID-19
epidemic
continues
to
spread
within
and
outside
of
China
,
despite
several
social
distancing
measures
implemented
by
the
Chinese
government
.

Limited
epidemiological
data
are
available
,
and
recent
changes
in
case
definition
and
reporting
further
complicate
our
understanding
of
the
impact
of
the
epidemic
,
particularly
in
the
epidemic
's
epicenter
.

Here
we
use
previously
validated
phenomenological
models
to
generate
short-term
forecasts
of
cumulative
reported
cases
in
Guangdong
and
Zhejiang
,
China
.

Using
daily
reported
cumulative
case
data
up
until
13
February
2020
from
the
National
Health
Commission
of
China
,
we
report
5and
10-day
ahead
forecasts
of
cumulative
case
reports
.

Specifically
,
we
generate
forecasts
using
a
generalized
logistic
growth
model
,
the
Richards
growth
model
,
and
a
sub-epidemic
wave
model
,
which
have
each
been
previously
used
to
forecast
outbreaks
due
to
different
infectious
diseases
.

Forecasts
from
each
of
the
models
suggest
the
outbreaks
may
be
nearing
extinction
in
both
Guangdong
and
Zhejiang
;
however
,
the
sub-epidemic
model
predictions
also
include
the
potential
for
further
sustained
transmission
,
particularly
in
Zhejiang
.

Our
10-day
forecasts
across
the
three
models
predict
an
additional
65-81
cases
(
upper
bounds
:
169-507
)
in
Guangdong
and
an
additional
44-354
(
upper
bounds
:
141-875
)
cases
in
Zhejiang
by
February
23
,
2020
.

In
the
best-case
scenario
,
current
data
suggest
that
transmission
in
both
provinces
is
slowing
down
.

Severe
cases
after
pH1N1
infection
are
consequence
of
interstitial
pneumonia
triggered
by
alveolar
viral
replication
and
an
exacerbated
host
immune
response
,
characterized
by
the
up-regulation
of
pro-inflammatory
cytokines
and
the
influx
of
inflammatory
leukocytes
to
the
lungs
.

Different
lung
cell
populations
have
been
suggested
as
culprits
in
the
unregulated
innate
immune
responses
observed
in
these
cases
.

This
study
aims
to
clarify
this
question
by
studying
the
different
induction
of
innate
immune
molecules
by
the
distinct
lung
anatomic
compartments
(
vascular
,
alveolar
and
bronchiolar
)
of
ferrets
intratracheally
infected
with
a
human
pH1N1
viral
isolate
,
by
means
of
laser
microdissection
techniques
.

The
obtained
results
were
then
analysed
in
relation
to
viral
quantification
in
the
different
anatomic
areas
and
the
histopathological
lesions
observed
.

More
severe
lung
lesions
were
observed
at
24
h
post
infection
(
hpi
)
correlating
with
viral
antigen
detection
in
bronchiolar
and
alveolar
epithelial
cells
.

However
,
high
levels
of
viral
RNA
were
detected
in
all
anatomic
compartments
throughout
infection
.

Bronchiolar
areas
were
the
first
source
of
IFN-α
and
most
pro-inflammatory
cytokines
,
through
the
activation
of
RIG-I
.

In
contrast
,
vascular
areas
contributed
with
the
highest
induction
of
CCL2
and
other
pro-inflammatory
cytokines
,
through
the
activation
of
TLR3

Background
:
Infections
due
to
parasitic
nematodes
are
common
causes
of
morbidity
and
fatality
around
the
world
especially
in
developing
nations
.

At
present
however
,
there
are
only
three
major
classes
of
drugs
for
treating
human
nematode
infections
.

Additionally
the
scientific
knowledge
on
the
mechanism
of
action
and
the
reason
for
the
resistance
to
these
drugs
is
poorly
understood
.

Commercial
incentives
to
design
drugs
that
are
endemic
to
developing
countries
are
limited
therefore
,
virtual
screening
in
academic
settings
can
play
a
vital
role
is
discovering
novel
drugs
useful
against
neglected
diseases
.

In
this
study
we
propose
to
build
robust
machine
learning
model
to
classify
and
screen
compounds
active
against
parasitic
nematodes
.

Results
:
A
set
of
compounds
active
against
parasitic
nematodes
were
collated
from
various
literature
sources
including
PubChem
while
the
inactive
set
was
derived
from
DrugBank
database
.

The
support
vector
machine
(
SVM
)
algorithm
was
used
for
model
development
,
and
stratified
ten-fold
cross
validation
was
used
to
evaluate
the
performance
of
each
classifier
.

The
best
results
were
obtained
using
the
radial
basis
function
kernel
.

The
SVM
method
achieved
an
accuracy
of
81.79
%
on
an
independent
test
set
.

Using
the
model
developed
above
,
we
were
able
to
indentify
novel
compounds
with
potential
anthelmintic
activity
.

In
this
study
,
we
successfully
present
the
SVM
approach
for
predicting
compounds
active
against
parasitic
nematodes
which
suggests
the
effectiveness
of
computational
approaches
for
antiparasitic
drug
discovery
.

Although
,
the
accuracy
obtained
is
lower
than
the
previously
reported
in
a
similar
study
but
we
believe
that
our
model
is
more
robust
because
we
intentionally
employed
stringent
criteria
to
select
inactive
dataset
thus
making
it
difficult
for
the
model
to
classify
compounds
.

The
method
presents
an
alternative
approach
to
the
existing
traditional
methods
and
may
be
useful
for
predicting
hitherto
novel
anthelmintic
compounds
.

The
influenza
B
viruses
belong
to
two
lineages
distinguished
by
their
genetic
and
antigenic
characteristics
,
which
are
referred
to
as
the
Yamagata
and
Victoria
lineages
,
designated
after
their
original
isolates
,
B/Yamagata/16/88
and
B/Victoria/2/87
.

The
primary
aim
of
this
study
was
to
evaluate
the
molecular
characteristics
of
influenza
B
viruses
circulating
in
a
region
of
Northern
Italy
,
Lombardia
,
during
the
influenza
season
of
2015-2016
.

Influenza
B
virus
was
detected
using
a
respiratory
virus
panel
of
assays
and
an
influenza
Bspecific
real-time
polymerase
chain
reaction
.

The
complete
influenza
B
hemagglutinin
(
HA
)
gene
was
amplified
and
sequenced
directly
from
clinical
specimens
.

Phylogenetic
analysis
was
performed
using
nucleotide
sequences
.

A
total
of
71
hospitalized
pediatric
patients
were
influenza
B
positive
.

Phylogenetic
analysis
showed
that
the
great
majority
of
influenza
B
strains
(
66/71
,
93.0
%
)
belonged
to
the
Victoria-lineage
and
were
antigenically
like

included
only
in
the
quadrivalent

The
H1
subtype
of
influenza
A
viruses
(
IAVs
)
has
been
circulating
in
swine
since
the
1918
human
influenza
pandemic
.

Over
time
,
and
aided
by
further
introductions
from
nonswine
hosts
,
swine
H1
viruses
have
diversified
into
three
genetic
lineages
.

Due
to
limited
global
data
,
these
H1
lineages
were
named
based
on
colloquial
context
,
leading
to
a
proliferation
of
inconsistent
regional
naming
conventions
.

In
this
study
,
we
propose
rigorous
phylogenetic
criteria
to
establish
a
globally
consistent
nomenclature
of
swine
H1
virus
hemagglutinin
(
HA
)
evolution
.

These
criteria
applied
to
a
data
set
of
7,070
H1
HA
sequences
led
to
28
distinct
clades
as
the
basis
for
the
nomenclature
.

We
developed
and
implemented
a
web-accessible
annotation
tool
that
can
assign
these
biologically
informative
categories
to
new
sequence
data
.

The
annotation
tool
assigned
the
combined
data
set
of
7,070
H1
sequences
to
the
correct
clade
more
than
99
%
of
the
time
.

Our
analyses
indicated
that
87
%
of
the
swine
H1
viruses
from
2010
to
the
present
had
HAs
that
belonged
to
7
contemporary
cocirculating
clades
.

Our
nomenclature
and
web-accessible
classification
tool
provide
an
accurate
method
for
researchers
,
diagnosticians
,
and
health
officials
to
assign
clade
designations
to
HA
sequences
.

The
tool
can
be
updated
readily
to
track
evolving
nomenclature
as
new
clades
emerge
,
ensuring
continued
relevance
.

A
common
global
nomenclature
facilitates
comparisons
of
IAVs
infecting
humans
and
pigs
,
within
and
between
regions
,
and
can
provide
insight
into
the
diversity
of
swine
H1

virus
and
its
impact
on
vaccine

Background
:
Avian
reovirus
(
ARV
)
is
a
member
of
the
Orthoreovirus
genus
in
the
Reoviridae
family
.

It
is
the
etiological
agent
of
several
diseases
,
among
which
viral
arthritis
and
malabsorption
syndrome
are
the
most
commercially
important
,
causing
considerable
economic
losses
in
the
poultry
industry
.

Although
a
small
but
increasing
number
of
reports
have
characterized
some
aspects
of
ARV
infection
,
global
changes
in
protein
expression
in
ARV-infected
host
cells
have
not
been
examined
.

The
current
study
used
a
proteomics
approach
to
obtain
a
comprehensive
view
of
changes
in
protein
levels
in
host
cells
upon
infection
by
ARV
.

The
proteomics
profiles
of
DF-1
chicken
fibroblast
cells
infected
with
ARV
strain
S1133
were
analyzed
by
two-dimensional
differential-image
gel
electrophoresis
.

The
majority
of
protein
expression
changes
(
$
1.5
fold
,
p,0.05
)
occurred
at
72
h
post-infection
.

Matrix-assisted
laser
desorption
ionization
time-of-flight
mass
spectrometry
identified
51
proteins
with
differential
expression
levels
,
including
25
that
were
upregulated
during
ARV
infection
and
26
that
were
downregulated
.

These
proteins
were
divided
into
eight
groups
according
to
biological
function
:
signal
transduction
,
stress
response
,
RNA
processing
,
the
ubiquitin-proteasome
pathway
,
lipid
metabolism
,
carbohydrate
metabolism
,
energy
metabolism
,
and
cytoskeleton
organization
.

They
were
further
examined
by
immunoblotting
to
validate
the
observed
alterations
in
protein
expression
.

Conclusion/Significance
:
This
is
the
first
report
of
a
time-course
proteomic
analysis
of
ARV-infected
host
cells
.

Notably
,
all
identified
proteins
involved
in
signal
transduction
,
RNA
processing
,
and
the
ubiquitin-proteasome
pathway
were
downregulated
in
infected
cells
,
whereas
proteins
involved
in
DNA
synthesis
,
apoptosis
,
and
energy
production
pathways
were
upregulated
.

In
addition
,
other
differentially
expressed
proteins
were
linked
with
the
cytoskeleton
,
metabolism
,
redox
regulation
,
and
stress
response
.

These
proteomics
data
provide
valuable
information
about
host
cell
responses
to
ARV
infection
and
will
facilitate
further
studies
of
the
molecular
mechanisms
underlying
ARV
pathogenesis
.

Currently
,
there
has
been
an
increasing
socioeconomic
impact
of
zoonotic
pathogens
transmitted
from
animals
to
humans
worldwide
.

Recently
,
in
the
Arabian
Peninsula
,
including
in
Saudi
Arabia
,
epidemiological
data
indicated
an
actual
increase
in
the
number
of
emerging
and/or
reemerging
cases
of
several
viral
zoonotic
diseases
.

Data
presented
in
this
review
are
very
relevant
because
Saudi
Arabia
is
considered
the
largest
country
in
the
Peninsula
.

We
believe
that
zoonotic
pathogens
in
Saudi
Arabia
remain
an
important
public
health
problem
;
however
,
more
than
10
million
Muslim
pilgrims
from
around
184
Islamic
countries
arrive
yearly
at
Makkah
for
the
Hajj
season
and/or
for
the
Umrah
.

Therefore
,
for
health
reasons
,
several
countries
recommend
vaccinations
for
various
zoonotic
diseases
among
preventive
protocols
that
should
be
complied
with
before
traveling
to
Saudi
Arabia
.

However
,
there
is
a
shortage
of
epidemiological
data
focusing
on
the
emerging
and
reemerging
of
zoonotic
pathogens
transmitted
from
animal
to
humans
in
different
densely
populated
cities
and/or
localities
in
Saudi
Arabia
.

Therefore
,
further
efforts
might
be
needed
to
control
the
increasing
impacts
of
zoonotic
viral
disease
.

Also
,
there
is
a
need
for
a
high
collaboration
to
enhance
the
detection
and
determination
of
the
prevalence
,
diagnosis
,
control
,
and
prevention
as
well
as
intervention
and
reduction
in
outbreaks
of
these
diseases
in
Saudi
Arabia
,
particularly
those
from
other
countries
.

Persons
in
the
health
field
including
physicians
and
veterinarians
,
pet
owners
,
pet
store
owners
,
exporters
,
border
guards
,
and
people
involved
in
businesses
related
to
animal
products
have
adopted
various
preventive
strategies
.

Some
of
these
measures
might
pave
the
way
to
highly
successful
prevention
and
control
results
on
the
different
transmission
routes
of
these
viral
zoonotic
diseases
from
or
to
Saudi
Arabia
.

Moreover
,
the
prevention
of
these
viral
pathogens
depends
on
socioeconomic
impacts
,
available
data
,
improved
diagnosis
,
and
highly
effective
therapeutics
or
prophylaxis
.

Rabies
remains
a
major
public
health
concern
in
many
developing
countries
.

The
precise
neuropathogenesis
of
rabies
is
unknown
,
though
it
is
hypothesized
to
be
due
to
neuronal
death
or
dysfunction
.

Mice
that
received
intranasal
inoculation
of
an
attenuated
rabies
virus
(
RABV
)
strain
HEP-Flury
exhibited
subtle
clinical
signs
,
and
eventually
recovered
,
which
is
different
from
the
fatal
encephalitis
caused
by
the
virulent
RABV
strain
CVS-11
.

To
understand
the
neuropathogenesis
of
rabies
and
the
mechanisms
of
viral
clearance
,
we
applied
RNA
sequencing
(
RNA-Seq
)
to
compare
the
brain
transcriptomes
of
normal
mice
vs.
HEP-Flury
or
CVS-11
intranasally
inoculated
mice
.

Our
results
revealed
that
both
RABV
strains
altered
positively
and
negatively
the
expression
levels
of
many
host
genes
,
including
genes
associated
with
innate
and
adaptive
immunity
,
inflammation
and
cell
death
.

It
is
found
that
HEP-Flury
infection
can
activate
the
innate
immunity
earlier
through
the
RIG-I/MDA-5
signaling
,
and
the
innate
immunity
pre-activated
by
HEP-Flury
or
Newcastle
disease
virus
(
NDV
)
infection
can
effectively
prevent
the
CVS-11
to
invade
central
nervous
system
(
CNS
)
,
but
fails
to
clear
the
CVS-11
after
its
entry
into
the
CNS
.

In
addition
,
following
CVS-11
infection
,
genes
implicated
in
cell
adhesion
,
blood
vessel
morphogenesis
and
coagulation
were
mainly
up-regulated
,
while
the
genes
involved
in
synaptic
transmission
and
ion
transport
were
significantly
down-regulated
.

On
the
other
hand
,
several
genes
involved
in
the
MHC
class
II-mediated
antigen
presentation
pathway
were
activated
to
a
greater
extent
after
the
HEP-Flury
infection
as
compared
with
the
CVS-11
infection
suggesting
that
the
collaboration
of
CD4
+
T
cells
and
MHC
class
II-mediated
antigen
presentation
is
critical
for
the
clearance
of
attenuated
RABV
from
the
CNS
.

The
differentially
regulated
genes
reported
here
are
likely
to
include
potential
therapeutic
targets
for
expanding
the
post-exposure
treatment
window
for
RABV
infection
.

Progressive
multifocal
leukoencephalopathy
(
PML
)
is
a
severely
debilitating
and
often
fatal
demyelinating
disease
of
the
central
nervous
system
(
CNS
)
in
immunosuppressed
individuals
caused
by
JC
polyomavirus
(
JCV
)
,
a
ubiquitous
human
pathogen
.

Demyelination
results
from
lytically
infected
oligodendrocytes
,
whose
clearance
is
impaired
in
the
setting
of
depressed
JCV-specific
T
cell-mediated
CNS
surveillance
.

Although
mutations
in
the
viral
capsid
and
genomic
rearrangements
in
the
viral
non-coding
region
appear
to
set
the
stage
for
PML
in
the
immunosuppressed
population
,
mechanisms
of
demyelination
and
CNS
antiviral
immunity
are
poorly
understood
in
large
part
due
to
absence
of
a
tractable
animal
model
that
mimics
PML
neuropathology
in
humans
.

Early
studies
using
mouse
polyomavirus
(
MPyV
)
in
T
cell-deficient
mice
demonstrated
productive
viral
replication
in
the
CNS
and
demyelination
;
however
,
these
findings
were
confounded
by
spinal
cord
compression
by
virus-induced
vertebral
bone
tumors
.

Here
,
we
review
current
literature
regarding
animal
models
of
PML
,
focusing
on
current
trends
in
antiviral
T
cell
immunity
in
non-lymphoid
organs
,
including
the
CNS
.

and

Availability
of
fast
,
high
throughput
and
low
cost
whole
genome
sequencing
holds
great
promise
within
public
health
microbiology
,
with
applications
ranging
from
outbreak
detection
and
tracking
transmission
events
to
understanding
the
role
played
by
microbial
communities
in
health
and
disease
.

Within
clinical
metagenomics
,
identifying
microorganisms
from
a
complex
and
host
enriched
background
remains
a
central
computational
challenge
.

As
proof
of
principle
,
we
sequenced
two
metagenomic
samples
,
a
known
viral
mixture
of
25
human
pathogens
and
an
unknown
complex
biological
model
using
benchtop
technology
.

The
datasets
were
then
analysed
using
a
bioinformatic
pipeline
developed
around
recent
fast
classification
methods
.

A
targeted
approach
was
able
to
detect
20
of
the
viruses
against
a
background
of
host
contamination
from
multiple
sources
and
bacterial
contamination
.

An
alternative
untargeted
identification
method
was
highly
correlated
with
these
classifications
,
and
over
1,600
species
were
identified
when
applied
to
the
complex
biological
model
,
including
several
species
captured
at
over
50
%
genome
coverage
.

In
summary
,
this
study
demonstrates
the
great
potential
of
applying
metagenomics
within
the
clinical
laboratory
setting
and
that
this
can
be
achieved
using
infrastructure
available
to
nondedicated
sequencing
centres

Background
:
Direct
evidence
of
lung
cancer
risk
in
Asian
users
of
angiotensin-converting
enzyme
inhibitors
(
ACEIs
)
is
lacking
.

Methods
:
The
ACEI
cohort
comprised
22,384
patients
aged
≥
18
years
with
a
first
prescription
of
ACEI
.

The
comparison
angiotensin
receptor
blocker
(
ARB
)
cohort
consisted
of
age-
,
sex-and
comorbidity-matched
patients
at
a
ratio
of
1:1
.

The
primary
outcome
was
the
incidence
of
lung
cancer
,
which
was
evaluated
using
a
proportional
hazard
model
.

Results
:
The
overall
incidence
rates
of
lung
cancer
in
the
ACEI
and
ARB
cohorts
were
16.6
and
12.2
per
10,000
person-years
,
respectively
.

The
ACEI
cohort
had
a
significantly
higher
risk
of
lung
cancer
than
the
ARB
cohort
(
adjusted
hazard

.

=
1.11-1.67
)
.

Duration-response
and
dose-response
analyses
revealed
that
compared
with
patients
who
did
not
receive
ACEIs
,
patients
who
received
ACEIs
for
more
than
45
days
per
year
(
aHR
=
1.87
;
95

=
1.48-2.36
)
and
patients
who
received
more
than
540
defined
daily
doses
of
ACEIs
per
year
(
aHR
=1.80
;
95
%
CI
=
1.43-2.27
)
had
a
significantly
higher
risk
of
lung
cancer
.

The
cumulative
incidence
of
lung
cancer
was
also
significantly
higher
in
the
ACEI
cohort
than
in
the
ARB
cohort
(
log-rank
test
,
p
=

)
.

Conclusions
:
ACEI
use
is
associated
with
an
increased
risk
of
lung
cancer
compared
with
ARB
use
.

Patients
using
ARBs
have
a
significantly
lower
risk
of
lung
cancer
than
non-ARB
users
.

All
positive
strand
RNA
viruses
are
known
to
replicate
their
genomes
in
close
association
with
intracellular
membranes
.

In
case
of
the
hepatitis
C
virus
(
HCV
)
,
a
member
of
the
family
Flaviviridae
,
infected
cells
contain
accumulations
of
vesicles
forming
a
membranous
web
(
MW
)
that
is
thought
to
be
the
site
of
viral
RNA
replication
.

However
,
little
is
known
about
the
biogenesis
and
three-dimensional
structure
of
the
MW
.

In
this
study
we
used
a
combination
of
immunofluorescence-and
electron
microscopy
(
EM
)
-based
methods
to
analyze
the
membranous
structures
induced
by
HCV
in
infected
cells
.

We
found
that
the
MW
is
derived
primarily
from
the
endoplasmic
reticulum
(
ER
)
and
contains
markers
of
rough
ER
as
well
as
markers
of
early
and
late
endosomes
,
COP
vesicles
,
mitochondria
and
lipid
droplets
(
LDs
)
.

The
main
constituents
of
the
MW
are
single
and
double
membrane
vesicles
(
DMVs
)
.

The
latter
predominate
and
the
kinetic
of
their
appearance
correlates
with
kinetics
of
viral
RNA
replication
.

DMVs
are
induced
primarily
by
NS5A
whereas
NS4B
induces
single
membrane
vesicles
arguing
that
MW
formation
requires
the
concerted
action
of
several
HCV
replicase
proteins
.

Three-dimensional
reconstructions
identify
DMVs
as
protrusions
from
the
ER
membrane
into
the
cytosol
,
frequently
connected
to
the
ER
membrane
via
a
neck-like
structure
.

In
addition
,
late
in
infection
multi-membrane
vesicles
become
evident
,
presumably
as
a
result
of
a
stress-induced
reaction
.

Thus
,
the
morphology
of
the
membranous
rearrangements
induced
in
HCV-infected
cells
resemble
those
of
the
unrelated
picorna-
,
corona-and
arteriviruses
,
but
are
clearly
distinct
from
those
of
the
closely
related
flaviviruses
.

These
results
reveal
unexpected
similarities
between
HCV
and
distantly
related
positive-strand
RNA
viruses
presumably
reflecting
similarities
in
cellular
pathways
exploited
by
these
viruses
to
establish
their
membranous
replication
factories

Epidemic
transitions
are
an
important
feature
of
infectious
disease
systems
.

As
the
transmissibility
of
a
pathogen
increases
,
the
dynamics
of
disease
spread
shifts
from
limited
stuttering
chains
of
transmission
to
potentially
large
scale
outbreaks
.

One
proposed
method
to
anticipate
this
transition
are
early-warning
signals
(
EWS
)
,
summary
statistics
which
undergo
characteristic
changes
as
the
transition
is
approached
.

Although
theoretically
predicted
,
their
mathematical
basis
does
not
take
into
account
the
nature
of
epidemiological
data
,
which
are
typically
aggregated
into
periodic
case
reports
and
subject
to
reporting
error
.

The
viability
of
EWS
for
epidemic
transitions
therefore
remains
uncertain
.

Here
we
demonstrate
that
most
EWS
can
predict
emergence
even
when
calculated
from
imperfect
data
.

We
quantify
performance
using
the
area
under
the
curve
(
AUC
)
statistic
,
a
measure
of
how
well
an
EWS
distinguishes
between
numerical
simulations
of
an
emerging
disease
and
one
which
is
stationary
.

Values
of
the
AUC
statistic
are
compared
across
a
range
of
different
reporting
scenarios
.

We
find
that
different
EWS
respond
to
imperfect
data
differently
.

The
mean
,
variance
and
first
differenced
variance
all
perform
well
unless
reporting
error
is
highly
overdispersed
.

The
autocorrelation
,
autocovariance
and
decay
time
perform
well
provided
that
the
aggregation
period
of
the
data
is
larger
than
the
serial
interval
and
reporting
error
is
not
highly
overdispersed
.

The
coefficient
of
variation
,
skewness
and
kurtosis
are
found
to
be
unreliable
indicators
of
emergence
.

Overall
,
we
find
that
seven
of
ten
EWS
considered
perform
well
for
most
realistic
reporting
scenarios
.

We
conclude
that
imperfect
epidemiological
data
is
not
a
barrier
to
using
EWS
for
many
potentially
emerging
diseases
.

Anticipating

Investigating

Major
histocompatibility
complex
(
MHC
)
genes
characterized
by
spectacular
polymorphism
and
fitness
association
have
become
valuable
adaptive
markers
.

Herein
we
investigate
the
variation
of
all
MHC
class
I
and
II
genes
across
seven
populations
of
an
endangered
bird
,
the
crested
ibis
,
of
which
all
current
individuals
are
offspring
of
only
two
pairs
.

We
inferred
seven
multilocus
haplotypes
from
linked
alleles
in
the
Core
Region
and
revealed
structural
variation
of
the
class
II
region
that
probably
evolved
through
unequal
crossing
over
.

Based
on
the
low
polymorphism
,
structural
variation
,
strong
linkage
,
and
extensive
shared
alleles
,
we
applied
the
MHC
haplotypes
in
population
analysis
.

The
genetic
variation
and
population
structure
at
MHC
haplotypes
are
generally
concordant
with
those
expected
from
microsatellites
,
underlining
the
predominant
role
of
genetic
drift
in
shaping
MHC
variation
in
the
bottlenecked
populations
.

Nonetheless
,
some
populations
showed
elevated
differentiation
at
MHC
,
probably
due
to
limited
gene
flow
.

The
seven
populations
were
significantly
differentiated
into
three
groups
and
some
groups
exhibited
genetic
monomorphism
,
which
can
be
attributed
to
founder
effects
.

We
therefore
propose
various
strategies
for
future
conservation
and
management

There
are
three
nonexclusive
mechanisms
for
PMS
:
(
1
)
heterozygotes
may
be
favored
because
they
can
recognize
a
greater
range
of
antigens
than
homozygotes
(
heterozygote
advantage
)
;
(
2
)
rare
alleles
may
have
a
selective
advantage
as
few
pathogens
are
adapted
to
them
(
frequency-dependent
selection
)
;
(
3
)
spatial/temporal
heterogeneity
in
the
pathogen
load
and
variation
may
maintain
MHC
diversity
at
the
global
scale
(
fluctuating
selection
)
[
11
]
.

Evaluating
the
relative
roles
of
natural
selection
and
genetic
drift
in
driving
the
maintenance
or
loss
of
MHC
diversity
is
challenging
,
and
discordant
results
have
been
reported
.

Some
studies
found
similar
population
structures
between
MHC
and
neutral
loci
,
and
it
was
proposed
that
genetic
drift
may
overwhelm
selection
in
shaping
MHC
variation
,
especially
in
small
and
bottlenecked
populations
[
1
,
12
,
13
]
.

Elevated
MHC
differentiation
across
populations
has
also
been
reported
,
supporting
the
dominant
role
of
fluctuating
selection
[
14
]
[
15
]
[
16
]
.

Moreover
,
limited
gene
flow
among
populations
can
promote
local
adaptation
to
consistent
pathogen
communities
,
and
this
spatial
variation
in
pathogen
selection
regimes
may
also
create
more
structure
in
MHC
genes
[
8
,
17
,
18
]
.

Previous
studies
of
MHC
variation
were
mainly
focused
at
the
allele
level
.

However
,
particularly
in
birds
and
reptiles
,
alleles
from
different
MHC
loci
are
sometimes
highly
similar
and
even
identical
to
each
other
because
of
frequent
gene
duplication
,
conversion
,
and
recombination
[
15
,
[
19
]
[
20
]
[
21
]
,
and
the
gene
copy
numbers
may
also
vary
among
individuals
[
21
]
[
22
]
[
23
]
[
24
]
[
25
]
.

These
issues
all
imply
that
genotypes
and
variation
estimated
on
the
basis
of
alleles
alone
would
be
unreliable
and
potentially
biased
[
21
]
.

Even
when
the
MHC
loci
are
reliably
separated
,
analysis
based
on
valid
genotypes
alone
,
without
considering
the
linkage
among
loci
(
which
is
often
strong
)
,
may
also
bias
the
results
[
21
]
.

For
example
,
different
results
were
obtained
on
the
basis
of
MHC
linkage
groups
compared
to
individual
alleles
in
populations
of
the
Egyptian
vulture
[
26
]
.

Similarly
,
certain
infections
in
badgers
were
associated
with
MHC
class
II-class
I
haplotypes
rather
than
allele
presence
[
27
]
.

Levels
of
individual
fitness
can
be
differentiated
more
profoundly
using
multilocus
haplotypes
.

Thus
,
population
analysis
using
multilocus
MHC
haplotype
with
consideration
of
the
sharing
of
alleles
,
the
copy
number
variation
(
CNV
)
,
and
the
linkage
among
loci
may
provide
more
comprehensive
knowledge
and
credible
evaluation
of
the
adaptive
variation
and
species
fitness
.

Moreover
,
it
is
essential
to
examine
both
MHC
class
I
and
II
genes
,
in
recognition
of
their
different
functions
,
although
only
a
few
studies
do
this
.

To
the
best
of
our
knowledge
,
no
avian
population
study
has
adopted
the
MHC
class
I-class
II
multilocus
haplotype
as
an
adaptive
marker
.

The

1981
at
Yangxian
,
China
[

.

Since
then
,
the
Chinese
government
have
made
great
efforts
to
protect
this
wild
population
(
in-situ
conservation
)
and
have
also
established
several
captive
populations
at
different
sites

conservation
)

.

Surprisingly
,
the
total
number
of
crested
ibis
has
now
increased
from
seven
to
over
2000
.

However
,
previous
studies
using
mitochondrial
DNA
and
microsatellite
markers
on
small
Nini
populations
revealed
extremely
low
levels
of
polymorphism
[

,
31
]
.

By
analyzing
the
genomes
of
57
historic
and
8
modern
samples
,
a
recent
study
revealed
ancestral
loss
of
genetic
variation
and
high
deleterious
mutation
owing
to
genetic
drift
and
inbreeding
depression
in
current
populations
[

.

There
have
been
a
growing
number
of
reports
regarding
various
infections
[
33
]
[
34
]
[
35
]
[
36
]
and
high
mortality
[
29
,
33
]
in
this
bird
,
indicating
frequent
threats
from
pathogens
and
undetermined
fitness
.

However
,
there
has
not
yet
been
any
large-scale
genetic
assessment
on
Nini
populations
.

It
is
imperative
that
such
an
assessment
is
completed
,
preferably
by
using
MHC
markers
characterized
by
high
polymorphism
and
fitness
relatedness
.

This
could
provide
insight
into
the
adaptive
diversity
and
differentiation
in
the
recovering
populations
,
thereby
better
evaluating
species
fitness
and
guiding
future
conservation
.

Fortunately
,
the
gene
architecture
of
the
MHC
region
has
been
well
illustrated
in
the
crested
ibis
:
~500
kb
MHC

contains
five
class
I
genes
including
one
major

,
three
minor

,
and
one
non-classical
locus
(

,
but
the
UAA
locus
is
located
beyond
the

Background
:
Type
I
interferon
(
IFN
)
inhibits
virus
replication
by
activating
multiple
antiviral
mechanisms
and
pathways
.

It
has
long
been
recognized
that
type
I
IFNs
can
potently
block
HIV-1
replication
in
vitro
;
as
such
,
HIV-1
has
been
used
as
a
system
to
identify
and
characterize
IFN-induced
antiviral
proteins
responsible
for
this
block
.

IFN-induced
HERC5
contains
an
amino-terminal
Regulator
of
Chromosome
Condensation
1
(
RCC1
)
-like
domain
and
a
carboxyl-terminal
Homologous
to
the
E6-AP
Carboxyl
Terminus
(
HECT
)
domain
.

HERC5
is
the
main
cellular
E3
ligase
that
conjugates
the
IFN-induced
protein
ISG15
to
proteins
.

This
E3
ligase
activity
was
previously
shown
to
inhibit
the
replication
of
evolutionarily
diverse
viruses
,
including
HIV-1
.

The
contribution
of
the
RCC1-like
domain
to
the
antiviral
activity
of
HERC5
was
previously
unknown
.

Results
:
In
this
study
,
we
showed
that
HERC5
inhibits
HIV-1
particle
production
by
a
second
distinct
mechanism
that
targets
the
nuclear
export
of
Rev/RRE-dependent
RNA
.

Unexpectedly
,
the
E3
ligase
activity
of
HERC5
was
not
required
for
this
inhibition
.

Instead
,
this
activity
required
the
amino-terminal
RCC1-like
domain
of
HERC5
.

Inhibition
correlated
with
a
reduction
in
intracellular
RanGTP
protein
levels
and/or
the
ability
of
RanGTP
to
interact
with
RanBP1
.

Inhibition
also
correlated
with
altered
subcellular
localization
of
HIV-1
Rev
.

In
addition
,
we
demonstrated
that
positive
evolutionary
selection
is
operating
on
HERC5
.

We
identified
a
region
in
the
RCC1-like
domain
that
exhibits
an
exceptionally
high
probability
of
having
evolved
under
positive
selection
and
showed
that
this
region
is
required
for
HERC5-mediated
inhibition
of
nuclear
export
.

Conclusions
:
We
have
identified
a
second
distinct
mechanism
by
which
HERC5
inhibits
HIV-1
replication
and
demonstrate
that
HERC5
is
evolving
under
strong
positive
selection
.

Together
,
our
findings
contribute
to
a
growing
body
of
evidence
suggesting
that
HERC5
is
a
novel
host
restriction
factor
.

Background

a
key
role
in

to

,
and
the
UK
healthcare
system
's
ability
to
cope
during
an

pandemic
will
depend
,
to
a

,
on
the
number
of
HCWs
who
are
able

UK

be

have
a
better
understanding
of
the
reasons
UK
HCWs
may
have
for
their

,
and
what
might
motivate
them
to
work
during
an

.

This
paper
reports
the
results
of
a
qualitative
study
that
explored
UK
HCWs
'
views
(
n
=
64
)
about
working
during
an
influenza
pandemic
,
in
order
to
identify
factors
that
might
influence
their
willingness
and
ability
to
work
and
to
identify
potential
sources
of
any
perceived
duty
on
HCWs
to
work
.

A
qualitative
study
,
using
focus
groups
(
n
=
9
)
and
interviews
(
n
=
5
)
.

HCWs
across
a
range
of
roles
and
grades
tended
to
feel
motivated
by
a
sense
of
obligation
to
work
through
an
influenza
pandemic
.

A
number
of
significant
barriers
that
may
prevent
them
from
doing
so
were
also
identified
.

Perceived
barriers
to
the
ability
to
work
included
being
ill
oneself
,
transport
difficulties
,
and
childcare
responsibilities
.

Perceived
barriers
to
the
willingness
to
work
included
:
prioritising
the
wellbeing
of
family
members
;
a
lack
of
trust
in
,
and
goodwill
towards
,
the
NHS
;
a
lack
of
information
about
the
risks
and
what
is
expected
of
them
during
the
crisis
;
fear
of
litigation
;
and
the
feeling
that
employers
do
not
take
the
needs
of
staff
seriously
.

Barriers
to
ability
and
barriers
to
willingness
,
however
,
are
difficult
to
separate
out
.

Conclusion
:
Although
our
participants
tended
to
feel
a
general
obligation
to
work
during
an
influenza
pandemic
,
there
are
barriers
to
working
,
which
,
if
generalisable
,
may
significantly
reduce
the
NHS
workforce
during
a
pandemic
.

The
barriers
identified
are
both
barriers
to
willingness
and
to
ability
.

This
suggests
that
pandemic
planning
needs
to
take
into
account
the
possibility
that
staff
may
be
absent
for
reasons
beyond
those
currently
anticipated
in
UK
planning
documents
.

In
particular
,
staff
who
are
physically
able
to
attend
work
may
nonetheless
be
unwilling
to
do
so
.

Although
there
are
some
barriers
that
can
not
be
mitigated
by
employers
(
such
as
illness
,
transport
infrastructure
etc
.

)
,
there
are
a
number
of
remedial
steps
that
can
be
taken
to
lesson
the
impact
of
others
(
providing
accommodation
,
building
reciprocity
,
provision
of
information
and
guidance
etc
)
.

We
suggest
that
barriers
to
working
lie
along
an
ability/willingness
continuum
,
and
that
absenteeism
may
be
reduced
by
taking
steps
to
prevent
barriers
to
willingness
becoming
perceived
barriers
to
ability
.

Central
to
the
One
Health
approach
and
any
disease
eradication
program
is
the
question
of
whether
a
pathogen
has
a
non-human
reservoir
.

Despite
well-established
conceptual
frameworks
that
define
a
reservoir
of
infection
,
empirical
characterization
of
reservoirs
often
remains
controversial
,
challenging
and
sometimes
misleading
.

What
is
essentially
missing
are
applicable
requirements
that
standardize
the
use
of
the
term
'reservoir
of
infection
'
across
multiple
disciplines
.

We
propose
an
empirical
framework
,
considering
maintenance
and
feasible
transmission
of
a
pathogen
,
to
standardize
the
acceptance
of
a
disease
reservoir
across
multiple
disciplines
.

We
demonstrate
the
intended
use
of
these
requirements
by
applying
them
to
different
diseases
that
are
known
to
infect
both
humans
and
animals

binding

and
were
hypothesized
that
they
all
bind
to
HLAIs
.

As
one
of
the

,
LILRA3
is

.

Nevertheless
,
little
was
known
about
the
binding
of
LILRA3
to

.

In

we
present

using

.

We
found
that
LILRA3
binds
both

and
non-classical
HLA-G1
but
with
reduced

compared
to
either

or

.

The

this
notion

Porcine
diarrhea
disease
in
newborn
and
suckling
piglets
due
to
infection
with
porcine
epidemic
diarrhea
virus
(
PEDV
)
is
a
leading
cause
of
economic
loss
in
the
pig
industry
globally
.

In
this
study
,
we
investigated
the
molecular
mechanism
of
the
host
innate
immune
response
to
PEDV
infection
.

The
expression
dynamics
of
antiviral
genes
(
e.g.
,
RIG-1
,
PKR
,
OAS1
,
Mx1
,
and
Mx2
)
and
inflammatory
cytokines
(
e.g.
,
IFN-α
,
in
porcine
small
intestinal
epithelial
(
IPEC-J2
)
cells
were
analyzed
following
PEDV
stimulation
.

The
results
showed
that
the
expression
of
antiviral
genes
(
e.g.
,
PKR
,
OAS1
,
and
Mx2
)
and
inflammatory
cytokines
(
e.g.
,
IFN-α
and
TNF-α
)
were
significantly
reduced
within
0-4
h
post-infection
(
P
<
0.05
)
.

However
,
all
antiviral
genes
and
inflammatory
cytokines
were
up-regulated
from
12
to
24
h
(
P
<
0.05
)
,
and
cytopathic
changes
were
observed
during
this
time
.

The
expression
of
RIG-1
,
PKR
,
OAS1
,
Mx1
,
and
Mx2
were
significantly
and
positively
correlated
to
each
other
during
the
entire
infection
(
P
<
0.01
)
.

The
results
suggested
that
the
RIG-1
,
PKR
,
OAS1
,
Mx1
,
and
Mx2
genes
may
play
an
important
role
in
PEDV
infection
in
piglets
.

Initially
,
PEDV
displayed
cellular
invasion
by
inhibiting
IFN-α
transcription
and
interfering
with
the
antiviral
function
of
PKR
,
OAS1
,
and
Mx2
,
ultimately
induced
an
intense
inflammatory
response
.

The
relationship
between
antiviral
genes
and
inflammatory
cytokines
with
PEDV
infection
at
the
cellular
level
provides
a
reference
for
studying
the
mechanism
of
resistance
to
PEDV
infection
in
piglets
.

Background
:
The
spike
(
S
)
protein
of
SARS-CoV
not
only
mediates
receptor-binding
but
also
induces
neutralizing
antibodies
.

We
previously
identified
the
receptor-binding
domain
(
RBD
)
of
S
protein
as
a
major
target
of
neutralizing
antibodies
in
animal
models
and
thus
proposed
a
RBD-based
vaccine
.

However
,
the
antigenicity
and
immunogenicity
of
RBD
in
humans
need
to
be
characterized
.

Results
:
Two
panels
of
serum
samples
from
recovered
SARS
patients
were
included
and
the
antibody
responses
against
the
RBD
were
measured
by
ELISA
and
micro-neutralization
assays
.

We
found
that
the
RBD
of
S
protein
induced
potent
antibody
responses
in
the

Conclusion
:
The

of

highly
immunogenic
in
humans

mediates
protective

Berberine
is
an

Berberine
from
Argemone

can
relax

(
ASM
)
;
however
,
whether
the
nonberberine
component
of
C.
phellodendri
has
similar
relaxant
action
was
unclear
.

An
n-butyl
alcohol
extract
of
C.
phellodendri
(
NBAECP
,
nonberberine
component
)
was
prepared
,
which
completely
inhibits
high
K
+

acetylcholine-
(
ACH-
)
induced
precontraction
of
airway
smooth
muscle
in
tracheal
rings
and
lung
slices
from
control
and
asthmatic
mice
,
respectively
.

The
contraction
induced
by
high
K
+
was
also
blocked
by
nifedipine
,
a
selective
blocker
of
L-type
Ca
2+
channels
.

The
ACH-induced
contraction
was
partially
inhibited
by
nifedipine
and
pyrazole
3
,
an
inhibitor
of
TRPC3
and
STIM/Orai
channels
.

Taken
together
,
our
data
demonstrate
that
NBAECP
can
relax
ASM
by
inhibiting
L-type
Ca
2+
channels
and
TRPC3
and/or
STIM/Orai
channels
,
suggesting
that
NBAECP
could
be
developed
to
a
new
drug
for
relieving
bronchospasm
.

We
report
a
technique
for
the
detection
of
aerosolized
viruses
.

Conventional
field-effect-transistor
(
FET
)
-based
techniques
use
solution-based
processes
,
thus
require
antibody
binding
to
the
detection
region
of
the
FET
prior
to
the
supply
of
the
analyte
.

With
the
method
described
here
,
virus-antibodybound
particles
are
delivered
to
the
FET
during
detection
;
therefore
,
neither
a
pre-treatment
antibody
binding
step
on
the
FET
channel
nor
washing
process
for
virus-antibody-binding
are
necessary
.

Our
method
is
based
on
the
concept
that
virus-antibody-bound
particles
are
larger
than
the
virus
or
antibody
alone
,
and
thus
have
larger
charge
numbers
following
aerosol
charging
.

When
these
particles
are
charged
by
negative
ions
and
electro-aerodynamically
deposited
on
a
substrate
,
there
exists
a
location
on
the
substrate
where
neither
lone
virus
nor
antibody
particles
land
,
and
where
only
virus-antibody-bound
particles
are
deposited
.

If
this
location
coincides
with
the
channel
of
the
FET
,
the
resulting
variation
in
the
current
can
be
used
to
indicate
the
existence
of
a
virus
.

By
aerosolizing
a
mixed
solution
of
the
virus
and
the
antibody
,
only
the
virus-antibody-bound
particles
were
transported
to
the
swCNT-FET
,
and
the
electric
current
in
the
swCNT-FET
decreased
to
30
%
of
that
measured
with
no
deposited
particles
.

Viruses
are
among
the
most
important
causes
of
human
disease
1-4
and
present
a
growing
concern
as
potential
agents
for
biological
warfare
and
terrorism
4,5
.

Rapid
,
selective
and
sensitive
detection
of
viruses
is
central
to
implementing
an
effective
response
to
viral
infections
,
such
as
through
medication
or
quarantine
.

Established
methods
for
viral
analysis
include
plaque
assays
,
immunological
assays
,
transmission
electron
microscopy
,
and
polymerase
chain
reaction
(
PCR
)
testing
for
viral
nucleic
acids
3,6,7
.

These
methods
,
however
,
can
not
achieve
rapid
detection
of
a
single
virus
;
moreover
,
they
often
require
a
relatively
high
level
of
sample
manipulation
,
which
is
inconvenient
with
infectious
materials
.

Nevertheless
,
the
ability
to
rapidly
,
directly
and
selectively
detect
individual
virus
particles
would
have
a
marked
impact
on
healthcare
by
enabling
diagnosis
at
the
earliest
stages
of
replication
within
a
host
system
.

Exposure
to
biological
aerosols
(
bioaerosols
)
,
such
as
those
from
H1N1
influenza
,
severe
acute
respiratory
syndrome
(
SARS
)
8
,
bird
flu
9
and
bioterrorism
attacks
10
,
has
resulted
in
huge
human
and
economic
costs
.

Furthermore
,
the
sustained
growth
in
international
travel
increases
the
risk
that
an
infectious
disease
may
develop
into
a
pandemic
.

These
threats
necessitate
real-time
bioaerosol
sensing
systems
;
however
,
development
of
such
systems
remains
a
challenge
.

Technologies
including
bioaerosol
mass
spectrometry
(
BAMS
)
11
,
surface-enhanced
Raman
spectroscopy
(
SERS
)
12
and
flow
cytometry
with
fluorochrome
13
have
been
developed
to
detect
bioaerosols
.

Fluorescence-based
instruments
,
such
as
the
ultraviolet
aerodynamic
particle

(
UVAPS
)

,
BioTrak

,
and
fluorescent

inertial
impactor
17
can
optically
measure
concentrations
of
total
and/or
viable
particles
in
real-time
.

However
,
these
techniques
are
not
capable

to

,
few
studies
have
investigated

apelin-13
metabolism
in

in
rats
with
no
studies
examining
its
stability
in
humans
.

We
therefore
aimed
to
develop
an
Lc-MS/MS
method
for
detection
and
quantification
of
intact
[
Pyr

have
used
this
method
to
identify
the
metabolites
generated
in

in

.

[

(

was

into
six
healthy
human
volunteers
for
120
minutes
and
blood
collected
at
time

and
120
minutes
after
infusion
.

Plasma
was
extracted
in
the
presence
of
guanidine
hydrochloride
and
analysed
by
Lc-MS/MS
.

Here
we
report
a
highly
sensitive
,
robust
and
reproducible
method
for
quantification
of
intact
[
Pyr

]
apelin-13
and
its
metabolites
in
human
plasma
.

Using
this
method
,
we
showed
that
the
circulating
concentration
of
intact
peptide
was
58.3
±
10.5
ng/ml
after
120
minutes
infusion
.

We
demonstrated
for
the
first
time
that
in
humans
,
[
pyr
1
]
apelin-13
was
cleaved
from
both
termini
but
the
C-terminal
was
more
susceptible
to
cleavage
.

Consequently
,
of
the
metabolites
identified
,
[
Pyr
1
]
apelin-13
(
1-12
)
,
[

apelin-13
(
1-10
)
and
[
pyr
1
]
apelin-13
(
1-6
)
were
the
most
abundant
.

these
data
suggest
that
apelin
peptides
designed
for
use
as
cardiovascular
therapeutics
,
should
include
modifications
that
minimise
C-terminal
cleavage
.

Apelin
is
an
endogenous
ligand
of
the
apelin
receptor
,
initially
characterised
from
bovine
stomach
extracts
as
a
77-amino
acid
preproprotein

.

The
prepro-apelin
is
further
cleaved
into
shorter
but
functional
fragments
including
apelin-36
,
apelin-17
,
apelin-13
and

that
contain
an
evolutionary
conserved
12-amino
acid
C-terminal
1-3
.

[
Pyr
1
]
apelin-13
was
subsequently
identified
as
the
most
predominant
isoform
of
the
apelin
family
of
peptides
in
the
cardiovascular
system
4,5
,
and
the
major
circulating
form
of
the
peptide

.

In
the
cardiovascular
system
,
apelin
is
the
most
potent
endogenous
inotropic
agent
yet
identified
4
.

Apelin
modulates
vascular
tone
in
vivo
,
decreasing
blood
pressure
when
infused
into
rats
and
dilating
resistance
vessels
when
infused
into
human
forearm

.

In
vitro
,
apelin
causes
nitric
oxide-dependent
vasodilation
of
human
splanchnic
artery
10
,
although
a
nitric
oxide-independent
,
prostanoid
dependent
vasodilation
in
humans
has
been
reported

.

Apelin
acted
as
a
vasoconstrictor
in
endothelium
denuded
vessels
via
a
direct
action
on
vascular
smooth
muscle
cells
whilst
also
acting
as
a
potent
angiogenic
factor
and
mitogen
of
endothelial
cells
4,11
.

Based
on
these
beneficial
effects
,
apelin
was
proposed
as
a
potential
therapeutic
target
in
cardiovascular
diseases
.

For
example
,
apelin
administration
showed
cardioprotective
effects
in
heart
failure
12
,
and
ameliorated
the
development
of

hypertension
in

13,14

Flaviviruses

as
their
genetic
material
,
are
one
of
the
most
pathogenic
families
of
viruses
.

There
is
an
increasing
amount
of
evidence
suggesting
that
their
5
'
and
3
'
non-coding
terminal
regions
are
critical
for
their
survival
.

Information
on
their
structural
features
is
essential
to
gain
detailed
insights
into
their
functions
and
interactions
with
host
proteins
.

In
this
study
,
the
5
'
and
3
'
terminal
regions
of
Murray
Valley
encephalitis
virus
and
Powassan
virus
were
examined
using
biophysical
and
computational
modeling
methods
.

First
,
we
used
size
exclusion
chromatography
and
analytical
ultracentrifuge
methods
to
investigate
the
purity
of
in-vitro
transcribed
RNAs
.

Next
,
we
employed
small-angle
X-ray
scattering
techniques
to
study
solution
conformation
and
low-resolution
structures
of
these
RNAs
,
which
suggest
that
the
3
'
terminal
regions
are
highly
extended
as
compared
to
the
5
'
terminal
regions
for
both
viruses
.

Using
computational
modeling
tools
,
we
reconstructed
3-dimensional
structures
of
each
RNA
fragment
and
compared
them
with
derived
small-angle
X-ray
scattering
low-resolution
structures
.

This
approach
allowed
us
to
reinforce
that
the
5
'
terminal
regions
adopt
more
dynamic
structures
compared
to
the
mainly
double-stranded
structures
of

Background
:
Marburg
virus
(
MARV
)
causes
severe
haemorrhagic
fever
in
humans
and
nonhuman
primates
and
has
a
high
mortality
rate
.

However
,
effective
drugs
or
licensed
vaccines
are
not
currently
available
to
control
the
outbreak
and
spread
of
this
disease
.

Methods
:
In
this
study
,
we
generated
MARV
virus-like
particles
(
VLPs
)
by
co-expressing
the
glycoprotein
(
GP
)
and
matrix
protein
(
VP40
)
using
the
baculovirus
expression
system
.

MARV
VLPs
and
three
adjuvants
,
Poria
cocos
polysaccharide
(
PCP-II
)
,
poly
(

)
and
aluminium
hydroxide
,
were
evaluated
after
intramuscular
vaccination
in
mice
.

Results
:
Murine
studies
demonstrated
that
vaccination
with
the
MARV
VLPs
induce
neutralizing
antibodies
and
cellar
immune
responses
.

MARV
VLPs
and
the
PCP-II
adjuvant
group
resulted
in
high
titres
of
MARV-specific
antibodies
,
activated

higher
numbers
of
B
cells
and
T
cells
in
peripheral

)
,
and
induced
greater
cytokine
secretion
from

than
the
other
adjuvants
.

Conclusion
:
MARV
VLPs
with
the
PCP-II
adjuvant
may
constitute
an
effective
vaccination
and
PCP-II
should

the
other
hand
are
a
natural
reservoir
for
these
viruses
and
are
able
to
withstand
most
avian
influenza
strains
.

Results
:
Transcriptomic
sequencing
of
lung
and
ileum
tissue
samples
from
birds
infected
with
high
(
H5N1
)
and
low
(
H5N2
)
pathogenic
influenza
viruses
has
allowed
us
to
compare
the
early
host
response
to
these
infections
in
both
these
species
.

Chickens
(
but
not
ducks
)
lack
the
intracellular
receptor
for
viral
ssRNA
,
RIG-I
and
the
gene
for
an
important
RIG-I
binding
protein
,
RNF135
.

These
differences
in
gene
content
partly
explain
the
differences
in
host
responses
to
low
pathogenic
and
highly
pathogenic
avian
influenza
virus
in
chicken
and
ducks
.

We
reveal
very
different
patterns
of
expression
of
members
of
the
interferon-induced
transmembrane
protein
(
IFITM
)
gene
family
in
ducks
and
chickens
.

In
ducks
,
IFITM1
,
2
and
3
are
strongly
up
regulated
in
response
to
highly
pathogenic
avian
influenza
,
where
little
response
is
seen
in
chickens
.

Clustering
of
gene
expression
profiles
suggests
IFITM1
and
2
have
an
anti-viral
response
and
IFITM3
may
restrict
avian
influenza
virus
through
cell
membrane
fusion
.

We
also
show
,
through
molecular
phylogenetic
analyses
,
that
avian
IFITM1
and
IFITM3
genes
have
been
subject
to
both
episodic
and
pervasive
positive
selection
at
specific
codons
.

In
particular
,
avian
IFITM1
showed
evidence
of
positive
selection
in
the
duck
lineage
at
sites
known
to
restrict
influenza
virus
infection
.

Conclusions
:
Taken
together
these
results
support
a
model
where
the
IFITM123
protein
family
and
RIG-I
all
play
a
crucial
role
in
the
tolerance
of
ducks
to
highly
pathogenic
and
low
pathogenic
strains
of
avian
influenza
viruses
when
compared
to
the
chicken
.

The
coronavirus
E
protein
is
a
small
membrane
protein
with
a
single
predicted
hydrophobic
domain
(
HD
)
,
and
has
a
poorly
defined
role
in
infection
.

The
E
protein
is
thought
to
promote
virion
assembly
,
which
occurs
in
the
Golgi
region
of
infected
cells
.

It
has
also
been
implicated
in
the
release
of
infectious
particles
after
budding
.

The
E
protein
has
ion
channel
activity
in
vitro
,
although
a
role
for
channel
activity
in
infection
has
not
been
established
.

Furthermore
,
the
membrane
topology
of
the
E
protein
is
of
considerable
debate
,
and
the
protein
may
adopt
more
than
one
topology
during
infection
.

We
previously
showed
that
the
HD
of
the
infectious
bronchitis
virus
(
IBV
)
E
protein
is
required
for
the
efficient
release
of
infectious
virus
,
an
activity
that
correlated
with
disruption
of
the
secretory
pathway
.

Here
we
report
that
a
single
residue
within
the
hydrophobic
domain
,
Thr16
,
is
required
for
secretory
pathway
disruption
.

Substitutions
of
other
residues
for
Thr16
were
not
tolerated
.

Mutations
of
Thr16
did
not
impact
virus
assembly
as
judged
by
virus-like
particle
production
,
suggesting
that
alteration
of
secretory
pathway
and
assembly
are
independent
activities
.

We
also
examined
how
the
membrane
topology
of
IBV
E
affected
its
function
by
generating
mutant
versions
that
adopted
either
a
transmembrane
or
membrane
hairpin
topology
.

We
found
that
a
transmembrane
topology
was
required
for
disrupting
the
secretory
pathway
,
but
was
less
efficient
for
virus-like
particle
production
.

The
hairpin
version
of
E
was
unable
to
disrupt
the
secretory
pathway
or
produce
particles
.

The
findings
reported
here
identify
properties
of
the
E
protein
that
are
important
for
its
function
,
and
provide
insight
into
how
the
E
protein
may
perform
multiple
roles
during
infection
.

Background
:
Nanoparticles
have
become
a
key
technology
in
multiple
industries
.

However
,
there
are
growing
reports
of
the
toxicity
of
nanomaterials
to
humans
.

In
particular
,
nanomaterials
have
been
linked
to
lung
diseases
.

The
molecular
mechanisms
of
nanoparticle
toxicity
are
largely
unexplored
.

Methods
:
Acute
lung
injury
was
induced
in
wild-type
mice
and
angiotensin-coverting
enzyme
2
(
ACE2
)
knockout
mice
by
the
intratracheal
instillation
of
cationic
polyamidoamine
dendrimer
(
PAMAM
)
nanoparticles
.

For
rescue
experiments
,
losartan
(
15
mg/kg
in
PBS
)
was
injected
intraperitoneally
30
min
before
nanoparticle
administration
.

Results
:
Some
PAMAM
nanoparticles
,
but
not
anionic
PAMAM
nanoparticles
or
carbon
nanotubes
,
triggered
acute
lung
failure
in
mice
.

Mechanistically
,
cationic
nanoparticles
can
directly
bind
ACE2
,
decrease
its
activity
and
down-regulate
its
expression
level
in
lung
tissue
,
resulting
in
deregulation
of
the
renin-angiotensin
system
.

Gene
inactivation
of
Ace2
can
exacerbate
lung
injury
.

Importantly
,
the
administration
of
losartan
,
which
is
an
angiotensin
II
type
I
receptor
antagonist
,
can
ameliorate
PAMAM
nanoparticle-induced
lung
injury
.

Conclusions
:
Our
data
provide
molecular
insight
into
PAMAM
nanoparticle-induced
lung
injury
and
suggest
potential
therapeutic
and
screening
strategies
to
address
the
safety
of
nanomaterials
.

ACE2
is
a
monocarboxypeptidase
which
generates
Angiotensin
(

)
from
Angiotensin

(

)
.

Attempts
to
target
the
kidney
Renin
Angiotensin
System
using
native
ACE2
to
treat
kidney
disease
are
hampered
by
its
large
molecular
size
,
100
kDa
,
which
precludes
its
glomerular
filtration
and
subsequent
tubular
uptake
.

Here
,
we
show
that
both
urine
and
kidney
lysates
are
capable
of
digesting
native
ACE2
into
shorter
proteins
of~60-75
kDa
and
then
demonstrate
that
they
are
enzymatically
very
active
.

We
then
truncated
the
native
ACE2
by
design
from
the
C-terminus
to
generate
two
short
recombinant
(
r
)
ACE2
variants
(
1-605
and
1-619AA
)
.

These
two
truncates
have
a
molecular
size
of~70
kDa
,
as
expected
from
the
amino
acid
sequence
and
as
shown
by
Western
blot
.

ACE2
enzyme
activity
,
measured
using
a
specific
substrate
,
was
higher
than
that
of
the
native
rACE2
(
1-740
AA
)
.

When
infused
to
mice
with
genetic
ACE2
deficiency
,
a
single
i.v
.

injection
of
1-619
resulted
in
detectable
ACE2
activity
in
urine
,
whereas
infusion
of
the
native
ACE2
did
not
.

Moreover
,
ACE2
activity
was
recovered
in
harvested
kidneys
from
ACE2-deficient
mice
infused
with
1-619
,
but
not
in
controls
(
23.1
±
4.3
RFU/µg
creatinine/h
and
1.96
±
0.73
RFU/µg
protein/hr
,
respectively
)
.

In
addition
,
the
kidneys
of
ACE2-null
mice
infused
with
1-619
studied
ex
vivo
formed
more
Ang
(
1-7
)
from
exogenous
Ang
II
than
those
infused
with
vehicle
(
AUC
8555
±
1933
vs.
3439
±
753
ng/mL
,
respectively
,
p
<
0.05
)
further
demonstrating
the
functional
effect
of
increasing
kidney
ACE2
activity
after
the
infusion
of
our
short
ACE2
1-619
variant
.

We
conclude
that
our
novel
short
recombinant
ACE2
variants
undergo
glomerular
filtration
,
which
is
associated
with
kidney
uptake
of
enzymatically
active
proteins
that
can
enhance
the
formation
of
Ang
(
1-7
)
from
Ang
II
.

These
small
ACE2
variants
may
offer
a
potentially
useful
approach
to
target
kidney
RAS
overactivity
to
combat
kidney
injury
.

Background
:
Water
soluble
cinnamon
extract
has
been
shown
to
increase
insulin
sensitivity
and
modulate
macrophage
activation
,
a
desirable
trait
for
the
management
of
obesity
or
atherosclerosis
.

Our
present
study
investigated
whether
cinnamon
water
extract
(
CWE
)
may
influence
the
differentiation
of
monocytes
into
macrophages
and
the
activity
of
macrophage
scavenger
receptors
,
commonly
observed
in
atherosclerotic
lesions
.

We
investigated
the
effect
of
CWE
on
the
expression
of
various
surface
markers
and
the
uptake
of
acetylated
low

lipoprotein
(
LDL
)
in
phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate
(

The

analyzed
.

Finally
,
the
role
of
extracellar
signal-related

(
ERK
)
1/2
in
SRA
synthesis
and
the
effect
of
CWE
on
PMA-stimulated
ERK1/2
were
determined
.

Results
:
CWE
inhibited
the
differentiation
of
monocyte
by
decreasing
the
expression
of
CD11b
,
CD36
and
SRA
and
the
uptake
of
acetyl
LDL
.

CWE
suppressed
the
upregulation
of
SRA
by
M-CSF
and
modulated
ERK1/2
activity
,
which
was
required
for
PMA-induced
SRA
synthesis
.

Conclusions
:
Our
results
demonstrate
that
CWE
was
able
to
interfere
with
monocyte
differentiation
and
macrophage
scavenger
activity
,
indicating
its
potential
in
preventing

Rabies
is
an
ancient
disease
but
remains
endemic
in
most
parts
of
the
world
and
causes
approximately
59,000
deaths
annually
.

The
mechanism
through
which
the
causative
agent
,
rabies
virus
(
RABV
)
,
evades
the
host
immune
response
and
infects
the
host
central
nervous
system
(
CNS
)
has
not
been
completely
elucidated
thus
far
.

Our
previous
studies
have
shown
that
lab-attenuated
,
but
not
wild-type
(
wt
)
,
RABV
activates
the
innate
immune
response
in
the
mouse
and
dog
models
.

In
this
present
study
,
we
demonstrate
that
lab-attenuated
RABV
causes
abortive
infection
in
astrocytes
,
the
most
abundant
glial
cells
in
the
CNS
.

Furthermore
,
we
found
that
lab-attenuated
RABV
produces
more
double-stranded
RNA
(
dsRNA
)
than
wt
RABV
,
which
is
recognized
by
retinoic
acidinducible
gene
I
(
RIG-I
)
or
melanoma
differentiation-associated
protein
5
(
MDA5
)
.

Activation
of
mitochondrial
antiviral-signaling
protein
(
MAVS
)
,
the
common
adaptor
molecule
for
RIG-I
and
MDA5
,
results
in
the
production
of
type
I
interferon
(
IFN
)
and
the
expression
of
hundreds
of
IFN-stimulated
genes
,
which
suppress
RABV
replication
and
spread
in
astrocytes
.

Notably
,
lab-attenuated
RABV
replicates
in
a
manner
identical
to
that
of
wt
RABV
in
MAVS−/−
astrocytes
.

It
was
also
found
that
lab-attenuated
,
but
not
wt
,
RABV
induces
the
expression
of
inflammatory
cytokines
via
the
MAVS-p38/NF-κB
signaling
pathway
.

These
inflammatory
cytokines
increase
the
blood-brain
barrier
permeability
and
thus
enable
immune
cells
and
antibodies
infiltrate
the
CNS
parenchyma
,
resulting
in
RABV
control
and
elimination
.

In
contrast
,
wt
RABV
restricts
dsRNA
production
and
thus
evades
innate
recognition
by
RIG-I/MDA5
in
astrocytes
,
which
could
be
one
of
the
mechanisms
by
which
wt
RABV
evades
the
host
immune
response
in
resident
CNS
cells
.

Our
findings
suggest
that
astrocytes
play
a
critical
role
in
limiting
the
replication
of
lab-attenuated
RABV
in
the
CNS
.

Symbiotic
microbes
impact
the
function
and
development
of
the
central
nervous
system
(
CNS
)
;
however
,
little
is
known
about
the
contribution
of
the
microbiota
during
viralinduced
neurologic
damage
.

We
identify
that
commensals
aid
in
host
defense
following
infection
with
a
neurotropic
virus
through
enhancing
microglia
function
.

Germfree
mice
or
animals
that
receive
antibiotics
are
unable
to
control
viral
replication
within
the
brain
leading
to
increased
paralysis
.

Microglia
derived
from
germfree
or
antibiotic-treated
animals
can
not
stimulate
viralspecific
immunity
and
microglia
depletion
leads
to
worsened
demyelination
.

Oral
administration
of
toll-like
receptor
(
TLR
)
ligands
to
virally
infected
germfree
mice
limits
neurologic
damage
.

Homeostatic
activation
of
microglia
is
dependent
on
intrinsic
signaling
through
TLR4
,
as
disruption
of
TLR4
within
microglia
,
but
not
the
entire
CNS
(
excluding
microglia
)
,
leads
to
increased
viralinduced
clinical
disease
.

This
work
demonstrates
that
gut
immune-stimulatory
products
can
influence
microglia
function
to
prevent
CNS
damage
following
viral
infection

Because
of
their

these

Results
:
Chronic
post-SARS
is
characterized
by
persistent
fatigue
,
diffuse
myalgia
,
weakness
,
depression
,
and
nonrestorative
sleep
with
associated
REM-related
apneas/hypopneas
,
an
elevated

EEG
cyclical
alternating
pattern
,
and
alpha
EEG
sleep
anomaly
.

Post-SARS
patients
had
symptoms
of
pre
and
post-sleep
fatigue
and
post
sleep
sleepiness
that
were
similar
to
the
symptoms
of
patients
with
FMS
,
and
similar
to
symptoms
of
patients
with
chronic
fatigue
syndrome
.

Both
post-SARS
and
FMS
groups
had
sleep
instability
as
indicated
by
the
high
sleep
EEG
cyclical
alternating
pattern
rate
.

The
post-SARS
group
had
a
lower
rating
of
the
alpha
EEG
sleep
anomaly
as
compared
to
the
FMS
patients
.

The
post-SARS
group
also
reported
less
pre-sleep
and
post-sleep
musculoskeletal
pain
symptoms
.

Conclusions
:
The
clinical
and
sleep
features
of
chronic
post-SARS
form
a
syndrome
of
chronic
fatigue
,
pain
,
weakness
,
depression
and
sleep
disturbance
,
which
overlaps
with
the
clinical
and
sleep
features
of
FMS
and
chronic
fatigue
syndrome
.

In
the
healthcare
environment
,
microorganisms
'
cross-transmission

A
recent
interest
has
grown
to
create
antimicrobial
copper
touch
surfaces
,
in
order
to
counteract
microbial
spread
in
the
healthcare
environment
.

For
the
first
time
,
five
French
long-term
care
facilities
were
at
50
%
fitted
with
copper
alloys
door
handles
and
handrails
.

Related
to
the
environmental
bacterial
contamination
,
1400
samples
were
carried
out
on
copper
and
control
surfaces
over
three
years
after
copper
installation
.

In
addition
,
some
copper
door
handles
were
taken
from
the
different
facilities
,
and
their
specific
activity
against
methicillin-resistant
S.
aureus
(
MRSA
)
was
tested
in
vitro
.

In
comparison
to
control
surfaces
,
copper
door
handles
and
handrails
revealed
significantly
lower
contamination
levels
.

This
difference
was
observed
in
the
five
long-term
care
facilities
and
it
persists
through
the
three
years
of
the
study
.

High
and
extreme
levels
of
bacterial
contamination
were
less
frequent
on
copper
surfaces
.

Although
,
the
antibacterial
activity
of
copper
surfaces
against
MRSA
was
lowered
after
three
years
of
regular
use
,
it
was
still
significant
as
compared
to
inert
control
surfaces
.

Therefore
,
copper
containing
surfaces
are
promising
actors
in
the
non-spreading
of
environmental
bacterial
contamination
in
healthcare
facilities

Infection
with
human
BK
polyomavirus
,
a
small
double-stranded
DNA
virus
,
potentially
results
in
severe
complications
in
immunocompromised
patients
.

Here
,
we
describe
the
in
vivo
variability
and
evolution
of
the
BK
polyomavirus
by
deep
sequencing
.

Our
data
reveal
the
highest
genomic
evolutionary
rate
described
in
double-stranded
DNA
viruses
,
i.e.
,
10
−3
-10
−5
substitutions
per
nucleotide
site
per
year
.

High
mutation
rates
in
viruses
allow
their
escape
from
immune
surveillance
and
adaptation
to
new
hosts
.

By
combining
mutational
landscapes
across
viral
genomes
with
in
silico
prediction
of
viral
peptides
,
we
demonstrate
the
presence
of
significantly
more
coding
substitutions
within
predicted
cognate
HLA-C-bound
viral
peptides
than
outside
.

This
finding
suggests
a
role
for
HLA-C
in
antiviral
immunity
,
perhaps
through
the
action
of
killer
cell
immunoglobulin-like
receptors
.

The
present
study
provides
a
comprehensive
view
of
viral
evolution
and
immune
escape
in
a
DNA
virus
.

Little
is
known
about
the
mechanisms
of
evolution
and
viral
immune
escape
in
doublestranded
DNA
(
dsDNA
)
viruses
.

Here
,
we
study
the
evolution
of
BK
polyomavirus
and
observe
the
highest
genomic
evolutionary
rate
described
so
far
for
a
dsDNA
virus
,
in
the
range
of
RNA
viruses
,
which
usually
evolve
rapidly
.

Furthermore
,
the
prediction
of
viral
peptides
to
determine
immune
escape
suggests
a
specific
role
of
HLA-C
in
antiviral
immunity
.

These
findings
are
helpful
for
future
advances
in
antiviral
therapies
and
provide
a
step
forward
in

The
accessory
protein
ORF3
of
porcine
epidemic
diarrhea
virus
(
PEDV
)
has
been
proposed
to
play
a
key
role
in
virus
replication
.

However
,
our
understanding
of
its
function
regarding
virus
and
host
interaction
is
still
limited
.

In
this
study
,
we
employed
immunoprecipitation
and
mass
spectrometry
to
screen
for
cellular
interacting
partners
of
ORF3
.

Gene
ontology
analysis
of
the
host
interactome
highlighted
the
involvement
of
ORF3
in
endosomal
and
immune
signaling
pathways
.

Among
the
identified
ORF3-interacting
proteins
,
the
vacuolar
protein-sorting-associated
protein
36
(
VPS36
)
was
assessed
for
its
role
in
PEDV
replication
.

VPS36
was
found
to
interact
with
ORF3
regardless
of
its
GLUE
domain
.

As
a
result
of
VPS36-ORF3
interaction
,
PEDV
replication
was
substantially
suppressed
in
cells
overexpressing
VPS36
.

Interestingly
,
the
ORF3
protein
expression
was
diminished
in
VPS36-overexpressing
cells
,
an
effect
that
could
not
be
restored
by
treatment
of
lysosomal
inhibitors
.

In
addition
,
disruption
of
endogenously-expressed
VPS36
by
siRNA
could
partially
augment
PEDV
replication
.

Taken
together
,
our
study
provides
mechanistic
insights
into
the
contribution
of
ORF3
in
PEDV
replication
.

Background
:
The
interplay
between
IFN-γ
,
IL-17
and
neutrophils
during
CNS
inflammatory
disease
is
complex
due
to
cross-regulatory
factors
affecting
both
positive
and
negative
feedback
loops
.

These
interactions
have
hindered
the
ability
to
distinguish
the
relative
contributions
of
neutrophils
,
Th1
and
Th17
cell-derived
effector
molecules
from
secondary
mediators
to
tissue
damage
and
morbidity
.

Methods
:
Encephalitis
induced
by
a
gliatropic
murine
coronavirus
was
used
as
a
model
to
assess
the
direct
contributions
of
neutrophils
,
IFN-γ
and
IL-17
to
virus-induced
mortality
.

CNS
inflammatory
conditions
were
selectively
manipulated
by
adoptive
transfer
of
virus-primed
wild-type
(
WT
)
or
IFN-γ
deficient
(
GKO
)
memory
CD4
+
T
cells
into
infected
SCID
mice
,
coupled
with
antibody-mediated
neutrophil
depletion
and
cytokine
blockade
.

Results
:
Transfer
of
GKO
memory
CD4
+
T
cells
into
infected
SCID
mice
induced
rapid
mortality
compared
to
recipients
of
WT
memory
CD4
+
T
cells
,
despite
similar
virus
control
and
demyelination
.

In
contrast
to
recipients
of
WT
CD4
+
T
cells
,
extensive
neutrophil
infiltration
and
IL-17
expression
within
the
CNS
in
recipients
of
GKO
CD4
+
T
cells
provided
a
model
to
directly
assess
their
contribution
(
s
)
to
disease
.

Recipients
of
WT
CD4
+
T
cells
depleted
of
IFN-γ
did
not
express
IL-17
and
were
spared
from
mortality
despite
abundant
CNS
neutrophil
infiltration
,
indicating
that
mortality
was
not
mediated
by
excessive
CNS
neutrophil
accumulation
.

By
contrast
,
IL-17
depletion
rescued
recipients
of
GKO
CD4
+
T
cells
from
rapid
mortality
without
diminishing
neutrophils
or
reducing
GM-CSF
,
associated
with
pathogenic
Th17
cells
in
CNS
autoimmune
models
.

Furthermore
,
co-transfer
of
WT
and
GKO
CD4
+
T
cells
prolonged
survival
in
an
IFN-γ
dependent
manner
,
although
IL-17
transcription
was
not
reduced
.

Conclusions
:
These
data
demonstrate
that
IL-17
mediates
detrimental
clinical
consequences
in
an
IFN-γ-deprived
environment
,
independent
of
extensive
neutrophil
accumulation
or
GM-CSF
upregulation
.

The
results
also
suggest
that
IFN-γ
overrides
the
detrimental
IL-17
effector
responses
via
a
mechanism
downstream
of
transcriptional
regulation
.

Within
the
last
two
decades
,
the
incidence
of
invasive
fungal
infections
has
been
significantly
increased
.

They
are
characterized
by
high
mortality
rates
and
are
often
caused
by
Candida
albicans
and
Aspergillus
fumigatus
.

The
increasing
number
of
infections
underlines
the
necessity
for
additional
anti-fungal
therapies
,
which
require
extended
knowledge
of
gene
regulations
during
fungal
infection
.

MicroRNAs
are
regulators
of
important
cellular
processes
,
including
the
immune
response
.

By
analyzing
their
regulation
and
impact
on
target
genes
,
novel
therapeutic
and
diagnostic
approaches
may
be
developed
.

Here
,
we
examine
the
role
of
microRNAs
in
human
dendritic
cells
during
fungal
infection
.

Dendritic
cells
represent
the
bridge
between
the
innate
and
the
adaptive
immune
systems
.

Therefore
,
analysis
of
gene
regulation
of
dendritic
cells
is
of
particular
significance
.

By
applying
next-generation
sequencing
of
small
RNAs
,
we
quantify
microRNA
expression
in
monocyte-derived
dendritic
cells
after
6
and
12
h
of
infection
with
C.
albicans
and
A.
fumigatus
as
well
as
treatment
with
lipopolysaccharides
(
LPS
)
.

We
identified
26
microRNAs
that
are
differentially
regulated
after
infection
by
the
fungi
or
LPS
.

Three
and
five
of
them
are
specific
for
fungal
infections
after
6
and
12
h
,
respectively
.

We
further
validated
interactions
of
miR-132-5p
and
miR-212-5p
with
immunological
relevant
target
genes
,
such
as
FKBP1B
,
KLF4
,
and
SPN
,
on
both
RNA
and
protein
level
.

Our
results
indicate
that
these
microRNAs
fine-tune
the
expression
of
immune-related
target
genes
during
fungal
infection
.

Beyond
that
,
we
identified
previously
undiscovered
microRNAs
.

We
validated
three
novel
microRNAs
via
qRT-PCR
.

A
comparison
with
known
microRNAs
revealed
possible
relations
with
the
miR-378
family
and
miR-1260a/b
for
two
of
them
,
while
the
third
one
features
a
unique
sequence
with
no
resemblance
to
known
microRNAs
.

In
summary
,
this
study
analyzes
the
effect
of
known
microRNAs
in
dendritic
cells
during
fungal
infections
and
proposes
novel
microRNAs
that
could
be
experimentally
verified
.

Traveller
screening
is
being
used
to
limit
further
spread
of
COVID-19
following
its
recent
emergence
,
and
symptom
screening
has
become
a
ubiquitous
tool
in
the
global
response
.

Previously
,
we
developed
a
mathematical
model
to
understand
factors
governing
the
effectiveness
of
traveller
screening
to
prevent
spread
of
emerging
pathogens
(
Gostic
et
al.
,
2015
)
.

Here
,
we
estimate
the
impact
of
different
screening
programs
given
current
knowledge
of
key
COVID-19
life
history
and
epidemiological
parameters
.

Even
under
best-case
assumptions
,
we
estimate
that
screening
will
miss
more
than
half
of
infected
people
.

Breaking
down
the
factors
leading
to
screening
successes
and
failures
,
we
find
that
most
cases
missed
by
screening
are
fundamentally
undetectable
,
because
they
have
not
yet
developed
symptoms
and
are
unaware
they
were
exposed
.

Our
work
underscores
the
need
for
measures
to
limit
transmission
by
individuals
who
become
ill
after
being
missed
by
a
screening
program
.

These
findings
can
support
evidence-based
policy
to
combat
the
spread
of
COVID-19
,
and
prospective
planning
to
mitigate

Conclusion
:
In
conclusion
,
the
RespoCheck
PCR
assay
can
be
a
valuable
tool
for
timely
and
accurate
detection
of
three

Background
:
Nasal
potential
difference
(
NPD
)
and
intestinal
current
measurement
(
ICM
)
are
functional
CFTR
tests
that
are
used
as
adjunctive
diagnostic
tools
for
cystic
fibrosis
(
CF
)
.

Smoking
has
a
systemic
negative
impact
on
CFTR
function
.

A
diagnostic
comparison
between
NPD
and
ICM
and
the
impact
of
smoking
on
both
CFTR
tests
has
not
been
done
.

Methods
:
The
sweat
chloride
test
,
NPD
,
and
ICM
were
performed
in
18
patients
with
CF
(
sweat
chloride
>
60
mmol/l
)
,
including
6
pancreatic
sufficient
(
PS
)
patients
,
and
13
healthy
controls
,
including
8
smokers
.

The
NPD
CFTR
response
to
Cl-free
and
isoproterenol
perfusion
(
Δ0Cl
−
+
Iso
)
was
compared
to
the
ICM
CFTR
response
to
forskolin/IBMX
,
carbachol
,
and
histamine
(
ΔI
sc
,
forskolin/IBMX+
carbachol+histamine
)
.

Results
:
The
mean
NPD
CFTR
response
and
ICM
CFTR
response
between
patients
with
CF
and
healthy
controls
was
significantly
different
(
p
<
0.001
)
,
but
not
between
patients
with
CF
who
were
PS
and
those
who
were
pancreatic
insufficient
(
PI
)
.

Smokers
have
a
decreased
CFTR
response
measured
by
NPD
(
p
=
0.049
)
.

For
ICM
there
is
a
trend
towards
decreased
CFTR
response
(
NS
)
.

Three
healthy
control
smokers
had
NPD
responses
within
the
CF-range
.

In
contrast
to
NPD
,
there
was
no
overlap
of
the
ICM
response
between
patients
with
CF
and
controls
.

Conclusions
:
ICM
is
superior
to
NPD
in
distinguishing
between
patients
with
CF
who
have
a
sweat
chloride
>
60
mmol/l
and
healthy
controls
,
including
smokers
.

Neither
NPD
nor
ICM
differentiated
between
patients
with
CF
who
were
PS
from
those
who
were
PI
.

Smoking
has
a
negative
impact
on
CFTR
function
in
healthy
controls
measured
by
NPD
and
challenges
the
diagnostic
interpretation
of
NPD
,
but
not
ICM
.

Purpose
:
Adverse
effects
of
antihypertensive
therapy
incur
substantial
cost
.

We
evaluated
whether
any
major
classes
of
antihypertensive
drugs
were
significantly
associated
with
switching
as
a
proxy
measure
of
medication
side
effects
in
a
large
Chinese
population
in
Hong
Kong
.

Methods
:
From
a
clinical
database
,
all
adult
patients
newly
prescribed
an
antihypertensive
mono-therapy
in
Hong
Kong
between
the
years
2001-2003
and
2005
were
included
.

Those
who
paid
only
one
visit
,
died
or
stayed
in
the
cohort
for
,180
days
after
the
prescription
,
or
prescribed
more
than
one
antihypertensive
agent
were
excluded
.

The
factors
associated
with
switching
at
180
days
were
evaluated
by
multivariate
regression
analyses
.

Age
,
gender
,
payment
status
,
service
type
,
district
of
residence
,
drug
class
,
systolic
and
diastolic
blood
pressure
levels
were
predictor
variables
.

Results
:
From
250,851
subjects
,
159,813
patients
were
eligible
.

A
total
of
6,163
(
3.9
%
)
switched
their
medications
within
180
days
.

Patients
prescribed
thiazide
diuretics
had
the
highest
switching
rate
(
5.6
%
)
,
followed
by
ACEIs
(
4.5
%
)
,
CCBs
(
4.4
%
)
and
beta-blockers
(
3.2
%
)
.

When
compared
with
ACEIs
,
patients
on
thiazide
diuretics
were
significantly
more
likely
to
be
switchers
(

)
,
whilst
patients
prescribed
CCBs
and
beta-blockers
were
similarly
likely
to
have
switching
.

Following
these
patients
up
for
5
years
showed
that
thiazide
had
the
most
marked
increase
in
switching
rate
.

Conclusions
:
The
higher
rates
of
switching
among
thiazide
diuretics
in
this
study
might
raise
a
probably
greater
incidence
of
their
adverse
effects
in
this
Chinese
population
,
yet
other
factors
might
also
influence
switching
rates
.

Patients
prescribed
thiazide
diuretics
for
longer
term
should
be
observed
for
their
intolerability
.

Lactoferrin
(
Lf
)
is
a
glycoprotein
of
the
primary
innate
immune-defense
system
of
mammals
present
in
milk
and
other
mucosal
secretions
.

This
protein
of
the
transferrin
family
has
broad
antimicrobial
properties
by
depriving
pathogens
from
iron
,
or
disrupting
their
plasma
membranes
through
its
highly
cationic
charge
.

Noteworthy
,
Lf
also
exhibits
immunomodulatory
activities
performing
up-and
down-regulation
of
innate
and
adaptive
immune
cells
,
contributing
to
the
homeostasis
in
mucosal
surfaces
exposed
to
myriad
of
microbial
agents
,
such
as
the
gastrointestinal
and
respiratory
tracts
.

Although
the
inflammatory
process
is
essential
for
the
control
of
invasive
infectious
agents
,
the
development
of
an
exacerbated
or
chronic
inflammation
results
in
tissue
damage
with
life-threatening
consequences
.

In
this
review
,
we
highlight
recent
findings
in
in
vitro
and
in
vivo
models
of
the
gut
,
lung
,
oral
cavity
,
mammary
gland
,
and
liver
infections
that
provide
experimental
evidence
supporting
the
therapeutic
role
of
human
and
bovine
Lf
in
promoting
some
parameters
of
inflammation
and
protecting
against
the
deleterious
effects
of
bacterial
,
viral
,
fungal
and
protozoan-associated
inflammation
.

Thus
,
this
new
knowledge
of
Lf
immunomodulation
paves
the
way
to
more
effective
design
of
treatments
that
include
native
or
synthetic
Lf
derivatives
,
which
may
be
useful

reduce

induce
vaccine
strain-specific
neutralizing
antibodies
that
usually
fail
to
provide
protection

.

Inclusion
in
the
vaccine
of
highly
conserved
internal
proteins
such
as
the
nucleoprotein
(
NP
)
and
the

An

was
observed
in
the
lungs
of
SAM

mice
after
influenza
infection
that
paralleled
with
reduced
lung
viral
titers
and
pathology
,
and
increased
survival
after
homologous

heterosubtypic
influenza
challenge
.

Finally
,
we
demonstrated
for
the
first

that
the
co-administration
of

)
and
protein
(
monovalent
inactivated

was
feasible
,
induced
simultaneously
NP-

enhanced

In
conclusion
,
systemic
administration
of
SAM
vectors
expressing
conserved
internal
influenza
antigens
induced
protective
immune
responses
in
mice

platform
as
another
promising
strategy
for
the

The
spread
of
many
respiratory
infections
is
determined
by
contact
patterns
between
infectious
and
susceptible
individuals
in
the
population
.

There
are
no
published
data
for
quantifying
social
contact
patterns
relevant
to
the
spread
of
respiratory
infectious
diseases
in
Hong
Kong
which
is
a
hotspot
for
emerging
infectious
diseases
due
to
its
high
population
density
and
connectivity
in
the
air
transportation
network
.

We
adopted
a
commonly
used
diary-based
design
to
conduct
a
social
contact
survey
in
Hong
Kong
in
2015/16
using
both
paper
and
online
questionnaires
.

Participants
using
paper
questionnaires
reported
more
contacts
and
longer
contact
duration
than
those
using
online
questionnaires
.

Participants
reported
13
person-hours
of
contact
and
8
contacts
per
day
on
average
,
which
decreased
over
age
but
increased
with
household
size
,
years
of
education

income
level
.

Prolonged
and
frequent
contacts
,
and
contacts
at
home
,
school
and
work
were
more
likely
to
involve
physical
contacts
.

Strong
age-assortativity
was
observed
in
all

Although
acute
kidney
injury
(
AKI
)
is
the
most
frequent
complication
in
patients
receiving
extracorporeal
membrane
oxygenation
(
ECMO
)
,
few
studies
have
been
conducted
on
the
risk
factors
of
AKI
.

We
performed
this
study
to
identify
the
risk
factors
of
AKI
associated
with
in-hospital
mortality
.

Data
from
322
adult
patients
receiving
ECMO
were
analyzed
.

AKI
and
its
stages
were
defined
according
to
Kidney
Disease
Improving
Global
Outcomes
(
KDIGO
)
classifications
.

Variables
within
24
h
before
ECMO
insertion
were
collected
and
analyzed
for
the
associations
with
AKI
and
in-hospital
mortality
.

Stage
3
AKI
was
associated
with
in-hospital
mortality
,
with
a
hazard
ratio
(
HR
)
(
95
%
CI
)
of
2.690
(
1.472-4.915
)
compared
to
non-AKI
(
p
=
0.001
)
.

The
simplified
acute
physiology
score
2
(
SAPS2
)
and
serum
sodium
level
were
also
associated
with
in-hospital
mortality
,
with
HRs
of
1.02
(
1.004-1.035
)
per
1
score
increase
(
p
=
0.01
)
and
1.042
(
1.014-1.070
)
per
1
mmol/L
increase
(
p
=
0.003
)
.

The
initial
pump
speed
of
ECMO
was
significantly
related
to
in-hospital
mortality
with
a
HR
of
1.333
(
1.020-1.742
)
per
1,000
rpm
increase
(
p
=
0.04
)
.

The
pump
speed
was
also
associated
with
AKI
(
p
=
0.02
)
and
stage
3
AKI
(
p
=
0.03
)
with
ORs
(

CI
)
of
2.018
(
1.129-3.609
)
and
1.576
(
1.058-2.348
)
,
respectively
.

We
also
found
that
the
red
cell
distribution
width
(
RDW
)
above
14.1
%
was
significantly
related
to
stage
3
AKI
.

There
are
four
human
coronaviruses
(
HCoVs
)
,
distributed
worldwide
,
that
are
associated
with
a
range
of
respiratory
symptoms
.

The
discovery
of
severe
acute
respiratory
syndrome
(
SARS
)
-CoV
and
Middle
East
respiratory
syndrome
(
MERS
)
-CoV
shows
that
HCoVs
pose
a
significant
threat
to
human
health
.

Our
work
aims
to
develop
a
sensitive
method
(
mCoV-MS
)
which
can
not
only
identify
known
HCoVs
accurately
,
but
also
have
the
ability
to
provide
clues
for
the
emerging
HCoVs
.

The
method
was
performed
using
a
MassARRAY
matrix-assisted
laser
desorption/ionization
time-of-flight
mass
spectrometry
(
MALDI-TOF
MS
)
system
.

We
developed
a
17-plex
analysis
to
detect
six
HCoVs
in
Panel
A
and
another
17-plex
analysis
to
detect
Alphacoronavirus
and
Betacoronavirus
in
Panel
B
.

All
tested
primers
and
probes
for
the
mCoV-MS
method
were
effective
,
with
no
cross-reactivity
observed
with
other
common
respiratory
viruses
.

To
confirm
the
usefulness
of
the
mCoV-MS
method
we
screened
384
pharyngeal
and/or
anal
swab
samples
collected
from
bats/rodents
,
and
131
nasal
and
throat
swabs
from
human
patients
.

The
results
showed
good
concordance
with
the
results
of
metagenomic
analysis
or
PCR-sequencing
.

The
validation
test
showed
mCoV-MS
method
can
detect
potentially
pathogenic
CoVs
in
Alphacoronavirus
and
Betacoronavirus
and
provide
convincingly
phylogenetic
evidences
about
unknown
CoVs
.

The
mCoV-MS
method
is
a
sensitive
assay
that
is
relatively
simple
to
carry
out
.

We
propose
that
this
method
be
used
to
complement
next
generation
sequencing
technology
for
large-scale
screening
studies
.

Given
the
increased
use
of
traditional
medicines
,
possibilities
that
would
ensure
its
successful
integration
into
a
public
health
framework
should
be
explored
.

This
paper
discusses
some
of
the
links
between
biodiversity
and
traditional
medicine
,
and
addresses
their
implications
to
public
health
.

We
explore
the
importance
of
biodiversity
and
ecosystem
services
to
global
and
human
health
,
the
risks
which
human
impacts
on
ecosystems
and
biodiversity
present
to
human
health
and
welfare
.

Background
:
Flavonoids
are
bio-active
specialized
plant
metabolites
which
mainly
occur
as
different
glycosides
.

Due
to
the
increasing
market
demand
,
various
biotechnological
approaches
have
been
developed
which
use
Escherichia
coli
as
a
microbial
catalyst
for
the
stereospecific
glycosylation
of
flavonoids
.

Despite
these
efforts
,
most
processes
still
display
low
production
rates
and
titers
,
which
render
them
unsuitable
for
large-scale
applications
.

In
this
contribution
,
we
expanded
a
previously
developed
in
vivo
glucosylation
platform
in
E.
coli
W
,
into
an
efficient
system
for
selective
galactosylation
and
rhamnosylation
.

The
rational
of
the
novel
metabolic
engineering
strategy
constitutes
of
the
introduction
of
an
alternative
sucrose
metabolism
in
the
form
of
a
sucrose
phosphorylase
,
which
cleaves
sucrose
into
fructose
and
glucose
1-phosphate
as
precursor
for
UDP-glucose
.

To
preserve
these
intermediates
for
glycosylation
purposes
,
metabolization
reactions
were
knocked-out
.

Due
to
the
pivotal
role
of
UDP-glucose
,
overexpression
of
the
interconverting
enzymes
galE
and
MUM4
ensured
the
formation
of
both
UDP-galactose
and
UDP-rhamnose
,
respectively
.

By
additionally
supplying
exogenously
fed
quercetin
and
overexpressing
a
flavonol
galactosyltransferase
(
F3GT
)
or
a
rhamnosyltransferase
(
RhaGT
)
,
0.94
g/L
hyperoside
(
quercetin
3-O-galactoside
)
and
1.12
g/L
quercitrin
(
quercetin
3-O-rhamnoside
)
could
be
produced
,
respectively
.

In
addition
,
both
strains
showed
activity
towards
other
promising
dietary
flavonols
like
kaempferol
,
fisetin
,
morin
and
myricetin
.

Conclusions
:
Two
E.
coli
W
mutants
were
engineered
that
could
effectively
produce
the
bio-active
flavonol
glycosides
hyperoside
and
quercitrin
starting
from
the
cheap
substrates
sucrose
and
quercetin
.

This
novel
fermentationbased
glycosylation
strategy
will
allow
the
economically
viable
production
of
various
glycosides
.

A
broad
spectrum
detection
platform
that
provides
sequence
level
resolution
of
target
regions
would
have
a
significant
impact
in
public
health
,
case
management
,
and
means
of
expanding
our
understanding
of
the
etiology
of
diseases
.

A
previously
developed
respiratory
pathogen
microarray
(
RPM
v.1
)
demonstrated
the
capability
of
this
platform
for
this
purpose
.

This
newly
developed
RPM
v.1
was
used
to
analyze
424
well-characterized
nasal
wash
specimens
from
patients
presenting
with
febrile
respiratory
illness
in
the
Washington
,
D.
C.
metropolitan
region
.

For
each
specimen
,
the
RPM
v.1
results
were
compared
against
composite
reference
assay
(
viral
and
bacterial
culture
and
,
where
appropriate
,
RT-PCR/PCR
)
results
.

Across
this
panel
,
the
RPM
assay
showed
$
98
%
overall
agreement
for
all
the
organisms
detected
compared
with
reference
methods
.

Additionally
,
the
RPM
v.1
results
provide
sequence
information
which
allowed
phylogenetic
classification
of
circulating
influenza
A
viruses
in
,250
clinical
specimens
,
and
allowed
monitoring
the
genetic
variation
as
well
as
antigenic
variability
prediction
.

Multiple
pathogens
(
2-4
)
were
detected
in
58
specimens
(
13.7
%
)
with
notably
increased
abundances
of
respiratory
colonizers
(
esp
.

S.
pneumoniae
)
during
viral
infection
.

This
first-ever
comparison
of
a
broad-spectrum
viral
and
bacterial
identification
technology
of
this
type
against
a
large
battery
of
conventional
``
gold
standard
''
assays
confirms
the
utility
of
the
approach
for
both
medical
surveillance
and
investigations
of
complex
etiologies
of
illness
caused
by
respiratory
co-infections
.

Background
:
Viral
protein
R
(
Vpr
)
,
a
protein
of
human
immunodeficiency
virus
type-1
(
HIV-1
)
with
various
biological
functions
,
was
shown
to
be
present
in
the
blood
of
HIV-1-positive
patients
.

However
,
it
remained
unclear
whether
circulating
Vpr
in
patients
'
blood
is
biologically
active
.

Here
,
we
examined
the
activity
of
blood
Vpr
using
an
assay
system
by
which
retrotransposition
of
long
interspersed
element-1
(
L1-RTP
)
was
detected
.

We
also
investigated
the
in
vivo
effects
of
recombinant
Vpr
(
rVpr
)
by
administrating
it
to
transgenic
mice
harboring
human
L1
as
a
transgene
(
hL1-Tg
mice
)
.

Based
on
our
data
,
we
discuss
the
involvement
of
blood
Vpr
in
the
clinical
symptoms
of
acquired
immunodeficiency
syndrome
(
AIDS
)
.

Results
:
We
first
discovered
that
rVpr
was
active
in
induction
of
L1-RTP
.

Biochemical
analyses
revealed
that
rVprinduced
L1-RTP
depended
on
the
aryl
hydrocarbon
receptor
,
mitogen-activated
protein
kinases
,
and
CCAAT/
enhancer-binding
protein
β
.

By
using
a
sensitive
L1-RTP
assay
system
,
we
showed
that
6
of
the
15
blood
samples
from
HIV-1
patients
examined
were
positive
for
induction
of
L1-RTP
.

Of
note
,
the
L1-RTP-inducing
activity
was
blocked
by
a
monoclonal
antibody
specific
for
Vpr
.

Moreover
,
L1-RTP
was
reproducibly
induced
in
various
organs
,
including
the
kidney
,
when
rVpr
was
administered
to
hL1-Tg
mice
.

Conclusions
:
Blood
Vpr
is
biologically
active
,
suggesting
that
its
monitoring
is
worthwhile
for
clarification
of
the
roles
of
Vpr
in
the
pathogenesis
of
AIDS
.

This
is
the
first
report
to
demonstrate
a
soluble
factor
in
patients
'
blood
active
for
L1-RTP
activity
,
and
implies
the
involvement
of
L1-RTP
in
the
development
of
human
diseases
.

Aims
:
The
purpose
of
this
study
was
to
assess
the
relationship
between
genetic
variants
and
steroid-induced
osteonecrosis
of
the
femoral
head
(
SONFH
)
in
steroid

.

Methods
:
We
searched
the
public
databases
up
to
April
15
,
2018
.

This
study
analyzed
only
the
single-nucleotide
polymorphisms
(
SNPs
)
that
have
appeared
in
more
than
three
studies

four
models
showed
that

,
but
the

did
not
.

The

Conclusion
:
An
allelic
model
of
ABCB1
rs1045642
showed
that
mutations
have
a
protective
effect
against
SONFH
at
a
very
low
level
of
evidence
.

The
mutations
in
ApoB

and
rs1042031
increase
the
SONFH

with
moderate

Avian
infectious
bronchitis
virus
(
IBV
)
is
an
evolving
and
dynamic
virus
that
causes
major
economic
losses
for
the
poultry
industry
worldwide
.

Continuous
evolution
and
emergence
of
new
variants
of
this
virus
are
the
major
challenges
for
controlling
the
disease
with
routine
vaccination
.

Successful
vaccination
usually
requires
the
use
of
a
homologous
vaccine
,
which
in
turn
necessitates
continuous
investigation
of
the
circulating
strains
.

Herein
,
we
performed
a
reverse
transcriptase-polymerase
chain
reaction-
(
RT-PCR-
)
based
investigation
in
broiler
chicken
flocks
of
the
Eastern
Region
of
Saudi
Arabia
.

IBV
was
detected
in
36.5
%
of
the
tested
flocks
(
42
out
of
115
)
from
January
2012
to
March
2014
.

Direct
sequencing
of
hypervariable
region-3
(
HVR-3
)
of
the
Spike
(
S

-1
gene
was
performed
,
followed
by
phylogenetic
analysis
to
determine
the
circulating
IBV
genotypes
.

Four
lineages
appear
to
coexist
in
this

include
two
subgroups
:
IS/720/99
IBV
(
16.7
%
)
and
IS/
Variant2/98
IBV
(
4.7
%
)
.

Some
of
the
detections
made
in
the
4/91
and
Mass
lineages
are
expected
to
belong
to
the
vaccine
strains
.

Lineages
without
a
homologous
vaccine
in
use
(
CK/CH/LDL/97I
and
Middle
East
)
represent
50
%
of
the
isolates
recovered
in
this
study
.

Based
on
identity
with
the
vaccine
sequences
,
field
observations
,
and
frequent
detection
,
these
two
lineages
appear
to
be
out
of
coverage
of
the
IBV
vaccines
used
in
Saudi
Arabia
.

is
is
the
first
time
to
identify
Middle
East
lineage
(
IS/720/99
IBV
and
IS/
Variant2/98
IBV
)
in
the
Eastern
Region
of
Saudi

.

Background
:
Respiratory
syncytial
virus
(
RSV
)
is
the
most
common
viral
cause
of
pediatric
bronchiolitis
and
pneumonia
worldwide
.

Risk
factors
for
high
mortality
and
prolonged
morbidity
after
RSV
infection
include
premature
birth
,
bronchopulmonary
dysplasia
,
congenital
heart
disease
,
and
Down
syndrome
.

However
,
some
previously
healthy
,
full-term
children
who
are
infected
with
RSV
also
require
hospitalization
and
even
experience
severe
sequelae
or
death
.

Case
presentation
:
In
this
report
,
we
present
the
case
of
an
RSV-associated
death
of
a
child
who
was
born
at
full-term
and
developed
normally
up
to
the
age
of
2
years
old
.

Cardiopulmonary
arrest
occurred
within
3
days
after
the
onset
of
symptoms
,
which
included
cough
and
high
fever
.

Complete
brain
edema
was
prominent
,
and
encephalopathy
was
developing
.

Viral
antigen
detection
and
microbiome
analyses
of
oral
swab
and
nasopharyngeal
aspirate
specimens
verified
an
RSV
infection
,
while
bacterial
culture
of
blood
specimens
yielded
negative
results
.

The
RSV
strain
detected
in
this
patient
was
subtyped
as
RSVB9
,
and
no
mutation
was
found
in
the
six
antigenic
sites
for
targeted
drugs
or
vaccines
.

Conclusions
:
The
patient
had
a
severe
infection
associated
with
RSV
,
which
was
very
likely
the
cause
of
her
central
nervous
system
infection
and
acute
neurological
complications
.

Background
:
Imported
cases
threaten
rabies
reemergence
in
rabies-free
areas
.

During
2000During
-2005
,
five
dog
and
one
human
rabies
cases
were
imported
into
France
,
a
rabies-free
country
since
2001
.

The
Summer
2004
event
led
to
unprecedented
media
warnings
by
the
French
Public
Health
Director
.

We
investigated
medical
practice
evolution
following
the
official
elimination
of
rabies
in
2001
;
impact
of
subsequent
episodic
rabies
importations
and
national
newspaper
coverage
on
demand
for
and
delivery
of
antirabies
prophylaxis
;
regular
transmission
of
epidemiological
developments
within
the
French
Antirabies
Medical
Center
(
ARMC
)
network
;
and
ARMC
discussions
on
indications
of
rabies
post-exposure
prophylaxis
(
RPEP
)
.

Methodology/Principal
Findings
:
Annual
data
collected
by
the
National
Reference
Center
for
Rabies
NRCR
(
1989NRCR
(
-2006
and
the
exhaustive
database
(
2000-2005
)
of
56
ARMC
were
analyzed
.

Weekly
numbers
of
patients
consulting
at
ARMC
and
their
RPEP-and
antirabies-immunoglobulin
(
ARIG
)
prescription
rates
were
determined
.

Autoregressive
integrated
movingaverage
modeling
and
regression
with
autocorrelated
errors
were
applied
to
examine
how
2000-2005
episodic
rabies
events
and
their
related
national
newspaper
coverage
affected
demand
for
and
delivery
of
RPEP
.

A
slight
,
continuous
decline
of
rabies-dedicated
public
health
facility
attendance
was
observed
from
2000
to
2004
.

Then
,
during
the
Summer
2004
event
,
patient
consultations
and
RPEP
and
ARIG
prescriptions
increased
by
84
%
,
19.7
%
and
43.4
%
,
respectively
.

Moreover
,
elevated
medical
resource
use
persisted
in
2005
,
despite
communication
efforts
,
without
any
secondary
human
or
animal
case
.

Conclusions
:
Our
findings
demonstrated
appropriate
responsiveness
to
reemerging
rabies
cases
and
effective
newspaper
reporting
,
as
no
secondary
case
occurred
.

However
,
the
ensuing
demand
on
medical
resources
had
immediate
and
longlasting
effects
on
rabies-related
public
health
resources
and
expenses
.

Henceforth
,
when
facing
such
an
event
,
decisionmakers
must
anticipate
the
broad
impact
of
their
media
communications
to
counter
the
emerging
risk
on
maintaining
an
optimal
public
health
organization
and
implement
a
post-crisis
communication
strategy
.

Background
:
Middle
East
respiratory
syndrome
coronavirus
(
MERS-CoV
)
has
caused
several
hospital
outbreaks
,
including
a
major
outbreak
at
King
Abdulaziz
Medical
City
,
a
940-bed
tertiary-care
hospital
in
Riyadh
,
Saudi
Arabia
(
August-September
2015
)
.

To
learn
from
our
experience
,
we
described
the
critical
care
response
to
the
outbreak
.

Methods
:
This
observational
study
was
conducted
at
the
Intensive
Care
Department
which
covered
5
ICUs
with
60
single-bedded
rooms
.

We
described
qualitatively
and
,
as
applicable
,
quantitatively
the
response
of
intensive
care
services
to
the
outbreak
.

The
clinical
course
and
outcomes
of
healthcare
workers
(
HCWs
)
who
had
MERS
were
noted
.

Results
:
Sixty-three
MERS
patients
were
admitted
to
3
MERS-designated
ICUs
during
the
outbreak
(
peak
census
=
27
patients
on
August
25
,
2015
,
and
the
last
new
case
on
September
13
,
2015
)
.

Most
patients
had
multiorgan
failure
.

Eight
HCWs
had
MERS
requiring
ICU
admission
(
median
stay
=
28
days
)
:
Seven
developed
acute
respiratory
distress
syndrome
,
four
were
treated
with
prone
positioning
,
four
needed
continuous
renal
replacement
therapy
and
one
had
extracorporeal
membrane
oxygenation
.

The
hospital
mortality
of
ICU
MERS
patients
was
63.4
%
(
0
%
for
the
HCWs
)
.

In
response
to
the
outbreak
,
the
number
of
negative-pressure
rooms
was
increased
from
14
to
38
rooms
in
3
MERS-designated
ICUs
.

Patients
were
managed
with
a
nurse-to-patient
ratio
of
1:0.8
.

Infection
prevention
practices
were
intensified
.

As
a
surrogate
,
surface
disinfectant
and
hand
hygiene
gel
consumption
increased
by
~30
%
and
17
N95
masks
were
used
per
patient/day
on
average
.

Family
visits
were
restricted
to
2
h/day
.

Although
most
ICU
staff
expressed
concerns
about
acquiring
MERS
,
all
reported
to
work
normally
.

During
the
outbreak
,
27.0
%
of
nurses
and
18.4
%
of
physicians
working
in
the
MERS-designated
ICUs
reported
upper
respiratory
symptoms
,
and
were
tested
for
MERS-CoV
.

Only
2/196

%
)
ICU
nurses
and
1/80
(
1.3
%
)
physician
tested
positive
,
had
mild
disease
and
recovered
fully
.

The
total
sick
leave
duration
was
138
days
for
nurses
and
30
days
for
physicians
.

Conclusions
:
Our
hospital
outbreak
of
MERS
resulted
in
63
patients
requiring
organ
support
and
prolonged
ICU
stay
with
a
high
mortality
rate
.

The
ICU

The
course
of
viral
infections
in
patients
with
acute
bronchitis
,
asthma
and
COPD
can
be
improved
by
oral
application
of
Pelargonium
sidoides
radix
extract
;
however
,
the
mechanism
is
not
well
understood
.

This
study
investigated
the
in
vitro
effect
of
Pelargonium
sidoides
radix
extract
(
EPs
7630
)
on
the
expression
of
virus
binding
cell
membrane
and
host
defence
supporting
proteins
on
primary
human
bronchial
epithelial
cells
(
hBEC
)
.

Cells
were
isolated
from
patients
with
severe
asthma
(
n
=
6
)
,
moderate
COPD
(
n
=
6
)
and
non-diseased
controls
(
n
=
6
)
.

Protein
expression
was
determined
by
Western-blot
and
immunofluorescence
.

Rhinovirus
infection
was
determined
by
immunofluorescence
as
well
as
by
polymerase
chain
reaction
.

Cell
survival
was
determined
by
manual
cell
count
after
live/death
immunofluorescence
staining
.

All
parameters
were
determined
over
a
period
of
3
days
.

The
results
show
that
EPs
7630
concentration-dependently
and
significantly
increased
hBEC
survival
after
rhinovirus
infection
.

This
effect
was
paralleled
by
decreased
expression
of
the
inducible
co-stimulator
(
ICOS
)
,
its
ligand
ICOSL
and
cell
surface
calreticulin
(
C1qR
)
.

In
contrast
,
EPs
7630
up-regulated
the
expression
of
the
host
defence
supporting
proteins
β-defensin-1
and
SOCS-1
,
both
in
rhinovirus
infected
and
un-infected
hBEC
.

The
expression
of
other
virus
interacting
cell
membrane
proteins
such
as
MyD88
,
TRL2/4
or
ICAM-1
was
not
altered
by
EPs
7630
.

The
results
indicate
that
EPs
7630
may
reduce
rhinovirus
infection
of
human
primary
BEC
by
down-regulating
cell
membrane
docking
proteins
and
up-regulating
host
defence
proteins
.

Background
:
Chemotherapy
is
the
main
treatment
for
triple-negative
breast
cancer
(
TNBC
)
,
which
lack
molecular
markers
for
diagnosis
and
therapy
.

Cancer
cells
activate
chemoresistant
pathways
and
lead
to
therapeutic
failure
for
patients
with
TNBC
.

Several
kinases
have
been
identified
as
chemoresistant
genes
.

However
,
the
involvement
of
kinases
in
the
chemoresistance
in
TNBC
cells
is
not
fully
understood
.

We
employed
a
kinome
siRNA
library
to
screen
whether
targeting
any
kinases
could
increase
the
chemosensitivity
of
TNBC
cell
lines
.

The
effects
of
kinase
on
cell
viability
in
various
breast
cancer
cells
were
validated
with
ATP
level
and
colony
formation
.

Protein
expression
and
phosphorylation
were
determined
by
immunoblotting
.

The
Cancer
Genome
Atlas
(
TCGA
)
dataset
was
collected
to
analyze
the
correlation
of
Src
expression
with
prognosis
of
TNBC
patients
.

Results
:
Primary
screening
and
validation
for
the
initial
hits
showed
that
Src
kinase
was
a
potential
doxorubicin-resistant
kinase
in
the
TNBC
cell
lines
MDA-MB-231
and
Hs578T
.

Both
siRNA
against
Src
and
the
Src
inhibitor
dasatinib
enhanced
the
cytotoxic
effects
of
doxorubicin
in
TNBC
cells
.

Moreover
,
phosphorylation
of
AKT
and
signal
transducer
and
activator
of
transcription
3
(
STAT3
)
,
downstream
effectors
of
Src
,
were
accordingly
decreased
in
Src-silenced
or
-inhibited
TNBC
cells
.

Additionally
,
TCGA
data
analysis
indicated
that
Src
expression
levels
in
tumor
tissues
were
higher
than
those
in
tumor-adjacent
normal
tissues
in
patients
with
TNBC
.

High
co-expression
level
of
Src
and
STAT3
was
also
significantly
correlated
with
poor
prognosis
in
patients
.

Our
results
showed
that
Src-STAT3
axis
might
be
involved
in
chemoresistance
of
TNBC
cells
.

Pathogens
of
bacterial
and
viral
origin
hijack
pathways
operating
in
eukaryotic
cells
in
many
ways
in
order
to
gain
access
into
the
host
,
to
establish
themselves
and
to
eventually
produce
their
progeny
.

The
detailed
molecular
characterization
of
the
subversion
mechanisms
devised
by
pathogens
to
infect
host
cells
is
crucial
to
generate
targets
for
therapeutic
intervention
.

Here
we
review
recent
data
indicating
that
coronaviruses
probably
co-opt
membranous
carriers
derived
from
the
endoplasmic
reticulum
,
which
contain
proteins
that
regulate
disposal
of
misfolded
polypeptides
,
for
their
replication
.

In
addition
,
we
also
present
models
describing
potential
mechanisms
that
coronaviruses
could
employ
for
this
hijacking
.

Essential
oil
extracted
from
Houttuynia
cordata
Thunb
.

(
H.
cordata
)
is
widely
used
in
traditional
Chinese
medicine
due
to
its
excellent
biological
activities
.

However
,
impurities
and
deficient
preparations
of
the
essential
oil
limit
its
safety
and
effectiveness
.

Herein
,
we
proposed
a
strategy
to
prepare
H.
cordata
essential
oil
(
HEO
)
safely
and
effectively
by
combining
the
solvent
extraction
and
the
macroporous
resin
purification
flexibly
,
and
then
encapsulating
it
using
microemulsion
.

The
extraction
and
purification
process
were
optimized
by
orthogonal
experimental
design
and
adsorption-desorption
tests
,
respectively
.

The
average
houttuynin
content
in
pure
HEO
was
then
validated
at
44.3
%
±
2.01
%
,
which
presented
a
great
potential
for
industrial
application
.

Subsequently
,
pure
HEO-loaded
microemulsion
was
prepared
by
high-pressure
homogenization
and
was
then
fully
characterized
.

Results
showed
that
the
pure
HEO-loaded
microemulsion
was
successfully
prepared
with
an
average
particle
size
of
179.1
nm
and
a
high
encapsulation
rate
of
94.7
%
.

Furthermore
,
safety
evaluation
tests
and
in
vitro
antiviral
testing
indicated
that
the
safety
and
activity
of
HEO
were
significantly
improved
after
purification
using
D101
resin
and
were
further
improved
by
microemulsion
encapsulation
.

These
results
demonstrated
that
the
purification
of
HEO
by
macroporous
resin
followed
by
microemulsion
encapsulation
would
be
a
promising
approach
for
industrial
application
of
HEO
for
the
antiviral
therapies
.

Background
.

In
Morocco
,
pediatric
pneumonia
remains
a
serious
public
health
problem
,
as
it
constitutes
the
first
cause
of
mortality
due
to
infectious
diseases
.

e
etiological
diagnosis
of
acute

infections
is
difficult
.

erefore
,
it
is
necessary
to
use
Multiplex

in
a

Objectives
.

In
this
paper
,
we
present
the
clinical
results
of
pediatric
pneumonia
and
describe
their
etiology
by
using
molecular
diagnosis
.

Study
design
:
Tracheal
secretion
was
collected
from
infants
presenting
respiratory
distress
isolated
or
associated
with
systemic
signs
,
attending
the
unit
of
Neonatology
between
December
1
,
2016
,
and
Mai
31
,
2018
.

Samples
were
tested
with
the
multiplex
RespiFinder
®
SMART

FAST
which
potentially
detects
18
viruses
and
4
bacteria
.

Results
.

Of
the
86
infants
considered
in
this
study
(
mean
age
31
±
19
days
)
suspected
of
acute
respiratory
tract
infections
,
71
(
83
%
)
were
positive
for
one
or
multiple
viruses
or/and
bacteria
.

e
majority
of
acute
respiratory
tract
infections
had
a
viral
origin
(
95
%
)
:
respiratory
syncytial
viruses
(

.

Among
our
patients
,
6
%
had
Mycoplasma
pneumoniae
.

Coinfections
were
not
associated
with
severe
respiratory
symptoms
.

Conclusion
.

e
clinical
spectrum
of
respiratory
infections
is
complex
and
often
nonspecific
.

us
,
the
early
and
fast
detection
of
related
causative
agents
is
crucial
.

e
use
of
multiplex
real
time
polymerase
chain
reaction
may
help
choose
an
accurate
treatment
,
reduce
the
overall
use
of
unnecessary
antibiotics
,
preserve
intestinal
flora
,
and
decrease
nosocomial
infection
by
reducing
the
length
of
hospitalization
.

Background
:
Enterovirus
71
(
EV71
)
is
one
of
the
major
causative
agents
of
hand
,
foot
,
and
mouth
disease
(
HFMD
)
,
which
is
sometimes
associated
with
severe
central
nervous
system
disease
in
children
.

There
is
currently
no
specific
medication
for
EV71
infection
.

Quercetin
,
one
of
the
most
widely
distributed
flavonoids
in
plants
,
has
been
demonstrated
to
inhibit
various
viral
infections
.

However
,
investigation
of
the
anti-EV71
mechanism
has
not
been
reported
to
date
.

The
anti-EV71
activity
of
quercetin
was
evaluated
by
phenotype
screening
,
determining
the
cytopathic
effect
(
CPE
)
and
EV71-induced
cells
apoptosis
.

The
effects
on
EV71
replication
were
evaluated
further
by
determining
virus
yield
,
viral
RNA
synthesis
and
protein
expression
,
respectively
.

The
mechanism
of
action
against
EV71
was
determined
from
the
effective
stage
and
time-of-addition
assays
.

The
possible
inhibitory
functions
of
quercetin
via
viral
2Apro
,
3C
pro
or
3D
pol
were
tested
.

The
interaction
between
EV71
3C
pro
and
quercetin
was
predicted
and
calculated
by
molecular
docking
.

Results
:
Quercetin
inhibited
EV71-mediated
cytopathogenic
effects
,
reduced
EV71
progeny
yields
,
and
prevented
EV71-induced
apoptosis
with
low
cytotoxicity
.

Investigation
of
the
underlying
mechanism
of
action
revealed
that
quercetin
exhibited
a
preventive
effect
against
EV71
infection
and
inhibited
viral
adsorption
.

Moreover
,
quercetin
mediated
its
powerful
therapeutic
effects
primarily
by
blocking
the
early
post-attachment
stage
of
viral
infection
.

Further
experiments
demonstrated
that
quercetin
potently
inhibited
the
activity
of
the
EV71
protease
,
3C
pro
,
blocking
viral
replication
,
but
not
the
activity
of
the
protease
,
2A
pro
,
or
the
RNA
polymerase
,
3D
pol
.

Modeling
of
the
molecular
binding
of
the
3C
pro
-quercetin
complex
revealed
that
quercetin
was
predicted
to
insert
into
the
substrate-binding
pocket
of
EV71
3C
pro
,
blocking
substrate
recognition
and
thereby
inhibiting
EV71
3C
pro
activity
.

Conclusions
:
Quercetin
can
effectively
prevent
EV71-induced
cell
injury
with
low
toxicity
to
host
cells
.

Quercetin
may
act
in
more
than
one
way
to
deter
viral
infection
,
exhibiting
some
preventive
and
a
powerful
therapeutic
effect
against
EV71
.

Further
,
quercetin
potently
inhibits
EV71
3C
pro
activity
,
thereby
blocking
EV71
replication
.

Isatis
indigotica
is
widely
used
in
Chinese
Traditional
Medicine
for
clinical
treatment
of
virus
infection
,
tumor
,
and
inflammation
,
yet
its
antiviral
activities
remain
unclear
.

This
study
probed
antiviral
activity
of
I.
indigotica
extract
and
its
marker
compounds
against
Japanese
encephalitis
virus
(
JEV
)
.

I.
indigotica
methanol
extract
,
indigo
,
and
indirubin
proved
less
cytotoxic
than
other
components
,
showing
inhibitory
effect
(
concentration-dependent
)
on
JEV
replication
in
vitro
.

Time-of-addition
experiments
proved
the
extract
,
indigo
,
and
indirubin
with
potent
antiviral
effect
by
pretreatment
(
before
infection
)
or
simultaneous
treatment
(
during
infection
)
,
but
not
posttreatment
(
after
entry
)
.

Antiviral
action
of
these
agents
showed
correlation
with
blocking
virus
attachment
and
exhibited
potent
virucidal
activity
.

In
particular
,
indirubin
had
strong
protective
ability
in
a
mouse
model
with
lethal
JEV
challenge
.

The
study
could
yield
anti-JEV
agents
.

Background
:
Porcine
deltacoronavirus
(
PDCoV
)
is
a
novel
coronavirus
that
can
cause
diarrhea
in
nursing
piglets
.

This
study
was
aimed
to
investigate
the
roles
of
host
differentially
expressed
genes
on
metabolic
pathways
in
PDCoV
infections
.

Results
:
Twenty
thousand
six
hundred
seventy-four
differentially
expressed
mRNAs
were
identified
in
5-day-old
piglets
responded
to
PDCoV
experimental
infections
.

Many
of
these
genes
were
correlated
to
the
basic
metabolism
,
such
as
the
peroxisome
proliferator-activated
receptor
(
PPAR
)
signaling
pathway
which
plays
a
critical
role
in
digestion
.

At
the
same
time
,
in
the
PPAR
pathway
genes
of
fatty
acid-binding
protein
(
FABP
)
family
members
were
observed
with
remarkably
differential
expressions
.

The
differential
expressed
genes
were
associated
with
appetite
decrease
and
weight
loss
of
PDCoV-affected
piglets
.

Discussion
:
Fatty
acid-binding
protein
1
(
FABP1
)
and
fatty
acid-binding
protein
3
(
FABP3
)
were
found
to
be
regulated
by
PDCoV
.

These
two
genes
not
only
mediate
fatty
acid
transportation
to
different
cell
organelles
such
as
mitochondria
,
peroxisome
,
endoplasmic
reticulum
and
nucleus
,
but
also
modulate
fatty
acid
metabolism
and
storage
as
a
signaling
molecule
outside
the
cell
.

Therefore
,
it
can
be
preliminarily
concluded
that
PPAR
differential
expression
caused
by
PDCoV
was
mostly
associated
with
weight
loss
and
death
from
emaciation
.

Conclusions
:
The
host
differentially
expressed
genes
were
associated
with
infection
response
,
metabolism
signaling
and
organismal
systems
signaling
pathways
.

The
genes
of
FABP
family
members
in
the
PPAR
signaling
pathway
were
the
most
highly
altered
and
played
important
roles
in
metabolism
.

Alteration
of
these
genes
were
most
likely
the
reason
of
weight
loss
and
other
clinical
symptoms
.

Our
results
provided
new
insights
into
the
metabolic
mechanisms
and
pathogenesis
of
PDCoV
infection
.

Modified
mRNA
(
modRNA
)
is
a
gene-delivery
platform
for
transiently
introducing
a
single
gene
or
several
genes
of
interest
to
different
cell
types
and
tissues
.

modRNA
is
considered
to
be
a
safe
vector
for
gene
transfer
,
as
it
negligibly
activates
the
innate
immune
system
and
does
not
compromise
the
genome
integrity
.

The
use
of
modRNA
in
basic
and
translational
science
is
rising
,
due
to
the
clinical
potential
of
modRNA
.

We
are
currently
using
modRNA
to
induce
cardiac
regeneration
post-ischemic
injury
.

Major
obstacles
in
using
modRNA
for
cardiac
ischemic
disease
include
the
need
for
the
direct
and
single
administration
of
modRNA
to
the
heart
and
the
inefficient
translation
of
modRNA
due
to
its
short
half-life
.

Modulation
of
the
5
0
untranslated
region
(
5
0
UTR
)
to
enhance
translation
efficiency
in
ischemic
cardiac
disease
has
great
value
,
as
it
can
reduce
the
amount
of
modRNA
needed
per
delivery
and
will
achieve
higher
and
longer
protein
production
post-single
delivery
.

Here
,
we
identified
that
5
0
UTR
,
from
the
fatty
acid
metabolism
gene
carboxylesterase
1D
(
Ces1d
)
,
enhanced
the
translation
of
firefly
luciferase
(
Luc
)
modRNA
by
2-fold
in
the
heart
post-myocardial
infarction
(
MI
)
.

Moreover
,
we
identified
,
in
the
Ces1d
,
a
specific
RNA
element
(
element
D
)
that
is
responsible
for
the
improvement
of
modRNA
translation
and
leads
to
a
2.5-fold
translation
increment
over
Luc
modRNA
carrying
artificial
5
0
UTR
,
post-MI
.

Importantly
,
we
were
able
to
show
that
5
0
UTR
Ces1d
also
enhances
modRNA
translation
in
the
liver
,
but
not
in
the
kidney
,
post-ischemic
injury
,
indicating
that
Ces1d
5
0
UTR
and
element
D
may
play
a
wider
role
in
translation
of
protein
under
an
ischemic
condition
.

Data
on
spontaneous
pathology
are
substantially
scarce
for
common
marmosets
,
compared
to
other
laboratory
animals
,
but
is
essential
for
the
interpretation
of
histological
findings
in
the
context
of
toxicological
and
experimental
studies
.

Especially
if
common
marmosets
are
used
as
experimental
animals
in
respiratory
research
,
detailed
knowledge
on
the
spectrum
,
occurrence
,
and
incidence
of
spontaneous
histopathological
pulmonary
lesions
in
this
non-human
primate
species
is
required
.

In
this
study
,
lung
tissue
of
638
common
marmosets
from
the
marmoset
colony
of
the
German
Primate
Center
was
examined
histologically
.

The
analysis
revealed
a
high
incidence
of
predominantly
mild
and
multifocal
interstitial
pneumonia
(
32.99
%
)
of
unknown
etiology
in
most
cases
.

Only
few
marmosets
exhibited
lobar
pneumonia
(
1.41
%
)
and
bronchopneumonia
(
0.94
)
,
which
were
mainly
caused
by
bacterial
pathogens
such
as
Bordetella
bronchiseptica
and
Klebsiella
pneumoniae
.

Lung
immaturity
and
atelectasis
were
common
histological
findings
in
newborn
marmosets
.

Typical
background
lesions
included
anthracosis
(
8.15
%
)
,
hemosiderosis
(
1.72
%
)
,
extramedullary
hematopoiesis
(
11.6
%
)
,
mineralization
(
10.97
%
)
,
and
inflammatory
cell
foci
(
10.34
%
)
.

In
addition
,
three
cases
of
pulmonary
arteriopathy
(
0.47
%
)
and
1
case
of
foreign-body
granuloma
(
0.16
%
)
were
detected
in
the
marmoset
study
cohort
.

The
high
prevalence
of
circulatory
disturbances
(
congestion
,
edema
,
hemorrhage
)
and
changes
in
air
content
(
secondary
atelectasis
,
alveolar
emphysema
)
could
partly
be
explained
by
euthanasia-related
artifacts
or
agonal
changes
.

The
present
study
provides
a
comprehensive
overview
of
the
range
and
incidence
of
spontaneous
pulmonary
histopathology
in
common
marmosets
,
serving
as
valuable

Today
,
the
treatment
of
bacterial

a
major

feature
,
which
considered
as
nucleic
acid-based
affinity
ligands
,
replacing
monoclonal
antibodies
.

The
aptamerbased
systems
have
been
found
to
be
talented
tools
in
the
treatment
of
microbial
infections
,
regarding
their
promising
anti-biofilm
and
antimicrobial
activities
;
they
can
reduce
or
inhibit
the
effects
of
bacterial
toxins
,
and
inhibit
pathogen
invasion
to
immune
cell
,
as
well
as
they
can
be
used
in
drug
delivery
systems
.

The
focus
of
this
review
is
on
the
therapeutic
applications
of
aptamers
in
infections
.

In
this
regard
,
an
introduction
of
infections
and
related
challenges
were
presented
,
first
.

Then
,
aptamer
definition
and
selection
,
with
a
brief
history
of
aptamers
development
against
various
pathogens
and
toxins
were
reviewed
.

Diverse
strategies
of
aptamer
application
in
drug
delivery
,
as
well
as
,
the
effect
of
aptamers
on
the
immune
system
,
as
the
main
natural
agents
of
human
defense
against
pathogens
,
were
also
discussed
.

Finally
,
the
future
trends
in
clinical
applications
of
this
technology
were
discussed
.

The
high
mutation
rate
of
RNA
viruses
enables
a
diverse
genetic
population
of
viral
genotypes
to
exist
within
a
single
infected
host
.

In-host
genetic
diversity
could
better
position
the
virus
population
to
respond
and
adapt
to
a
diverse
array
of
selective
pressures
such
as
host-switching
events
.

Multiple
new
coronaviruses
,
including
SARS
,
have
been
identified
in
human
samples
just
within
the
last
ten
years
,
demonstrating
the
potential
of
coronaviruses
as
emergent
human
pathogens
.

Deep
sequencing
was
used
to
characterize
genomic
changes
in
coronavirus
quasispecies
during
simulated
host-switching
.

Three
bovine
nasal
samples
infected
with
bovine
coronavirus
were
used
to
infect
human
and
bovine
macrophage
and
lung
cell
lines
.

The
virus
reproduced
relatively
well
in
macrophages
,
but
the
lung
cell
lines
were
not
infected
efficiently
enough
to
allow
passage
of
non
lab-adapted
samples
.

Approximately
12
kb
of
the
genome
was
amplified
before
and
after
passage
and
sequenced
at
average
coverages
of
nearly
9506
(
454
sequencing
)
and
38,0006
(
Illumina
)
.

The
consensus
sequence
of
many
of
the
passaged
samples
had
a
12
nucleotide
insert
in
the
consensus
sequence
of
the
spike
gene
,
and
multiple
point
mutations
were
associated
with
the
presence
of
the
insert
.

Deep
sequencing
revealed
that
the
insert
was
present
but
very
rare
in
the
unpassaged
samples
and
could
quickly
shift
to
dominate
the
population
when
placed
in
a
different
environment
.

The
insert
coded
for
three
arginine
residues
,
occurred
in
a
region
associated
with
fusion
entry
into
host
cells
,
and
may
allow
infection
of
new
cell
types
via
heparin
sulfate
binding
.

Analysis
of
the
deep
sequencing
data
indicated
that
two
distinct
genotypes
circulated
at
different
frequency
levels
in
each
sample
,
and
support
the
hypothesis
that
the
mutations
present
in
passaged
strains
were
``
selected
''
from
a
pre-existing
pool
rather
than
through
de
novo
mutation
and
subsequent
population
fixation
.

Background
:
Infections
are
often
associated
to
comorbidity
that
increases
the
risk
of
medical
conditions
which
can
lead
to
further
morbidity
and
mortality
.

SARS
is
a
threat
which
is
similar
to
MERS
virus
,
but
the
comorbidity
is
the
key
aspect
to
underline
their
different
impacts
.

One
UK
doctor
says
``
I
'd
rather
have
HIV
than
diabetes
''
as
life
expectancy
among
diabetes
patients
is
lower
than
that
of
HIV
.

However
,
HIV
has
a
comorbidity
impact
on
the
diabetes
.

Results
:
We
present
a
quantitative
framework
to
compare
and
explore
comorbidity
between
diseases
.

By
using
neighbourhood
based
benchmark
and
topological
methods
,
we
have
built
comorbidity
relationships
network
based
on
the
OMIM
and
our
identified
significant
genes
.

Then
based
on
the
gene
expression
,
PPI
and
signalling
pathways
data
,
we
investigate
the
comorbidity
association
of
these
2
infective
pathologies
with
other
7
diseases
(
heart
failure
,
kidney
disorder
,
breast
cancer
,
neurodegenerative
disorders
,
bone
diseases
,
Type
1
and
Type
2
diabetes
)
.

Phenotypic
association
is
measured
by
calculating
both
the
Relative
Risk
as
the
quantified
measures
of
comorbidity
tendency
of
two
disease
pairs
and
the
φ-correlation
to
measure
the
robustness
of
the
comorbidity
associations
.

The
differential
gene
expression
profiling
strongly
suggests
that
the
response
of
SARS
affected
patients
seems
to
be
mainly
an
innate
inflammatory
response
and
statistically
dysregulates
a
large
number
of
genes
,
pathways
and
PPIs
subnetworks
in
different
pathologies
such
as
chronic
heart
failure
(
21
genes
)
,
breast
cancer
(
16
genes
)
and
bone
diseases
(
11
genes
)
.

HIV-1
induces
comorbidities
relationship
with
many
other
diseases
,
particularly
strong
correlation
with
the
neurological
,
cancer
,
metabolic
and
immunological
diseases
.

Similar
comorbidities
risk
is
observed
from
the
clinical
information
.

Moreover
,
SARS
and
HIV
infections
dysregulate
4
genes
(
ANXA3
,
GNS
,
HIST1H1C
,
RASA3
)
and
3
genes
(
HBA1
,
TFRC
,
GHITM
)
respectively
that
affect
the
ageing
process
.

It
is
notable
that
HIV
and
SARS
similarly
dysregulated
11
genes
and
3
pathways
.

Only
4
significantly
dysregulated
genes
are
common
between
SARS-CoV
and
MERS-CoV
,
including
NFKBIA
that
is
a
key
regulator
of
immune
responsiveness
implicated
in
susceptibility
to
infectious
and
inflammatory
diseases
.

Our
method
presents
a
ripe
opportunity
to
use
data-driven
approaches
for
advancing
our
current
knowledge
on
disease
mechanism
and
predicting
disease
comorbidities
in
a
quantitative
way
.

Griffithsin
is
a
marine
algal
lectin
that
exhibits
broad-spectrum
antiviral
activity
by
binding
oligomannose
glycans
on
viral
envelope
glycoproteins
,
including
those
found
in
HIV-1
,
HSV-2
,
SARS
,
HCV
and
other
enveloped
viruses
.

An
efficient
,
scalable
and
cost-effective
manufacturing
process
for
Griffithsin
is
essential
for
the
adoption
of
this
drug
in
human
antiviral
prophylaxis
and
therapy
,
particularly
in
cost-sensitive
indications
such
as
topical
microbicides
for
HIV-1
prevention
.

The
production
of
certain
classes
of
recombinant
biologics
in
plants
can
offer
scalability
,
cost
and
environmental
impact
advantages
over
traditional
biomanufacturing
platforms
.

Previously
,
we
showed
the
technical
viability
of
producing
recombinant
Griffithsin
in
plants
.

In
this
study
,
we
conducted
a
technoeconomic
analysis
(
TEA
)
of
plant-produced
Griffithsin
manufactured
at
commercial
launch
volumes
for
use
in
HIV
microbicides
.

Data
derived
from
multiple
non-sequential
manufacturing
batches
conducted
at
pilot
scale
and
existing
facility
designs
were
used
to
build
a
technoeconomic
model
using
SuperPro
Designer
modeling
software
.

With
an
assumed
commercial
launch
volume
of
20
kg
Griffithsin/year
for
6.7
million
doses
of
Griffithsin
microbicide
at
3
mg/dose
,
a
transient
vector
expression
yield
of
0.52
g
Griffithsin/kg
leaf
biomass
,
recovery
efficiency
of
70
%
,
and
purity
of
>
99
%
,
we
calculated
a
manufacturing
cost
for
the
drug
substance
of
$
0.32/dose
and
estimated
a
bulk
product
cost
of
$
0.38/dose
assuming
a
20
%
net
fee
for
a
contract
manufacturing
organization
(
CMO
)
.

This
is
the
first
report
modeling
the
manufacturing
economics
of
Griffithsin
.

The
process
analyzed
is
readily
scalable
and
subject
to
efficiency
improvements
and
could
provide
the
needed
market
volumes
of
the
lectin
within
an
acceptable
range
of
costs
,
even
for
cost-constrained
products
such
as
microbicides
.

The
manufacturing
process
was
also
assessed
for
environmental
,
health
and
safety
impact
and
found
to
have
a
highly
favorable
environmental
output
index
with
negligible
risks
to
health
and
safety
.

The
results
of
this
study
help
validate
the
plant-based
manufacturing
platform
and
should
assist
in
selecting
preferred
indications
for
Griffithsin
as
a
novel
drug
.

Coronaviruses
raise
serious
concerns
as
emerging
zoonotic
viruses
without
specific
antiviral
drugs
available
.

Here
we
screened
a
collection
of
16671
diverse
compounds
for
anti-human
coronavirus
229E
activity
and
identified
an
inhibitor
,
designated
K22
,
that
specifically
targets
membrane-bound
coronaviral
RNA
synthesis
.

K22
exerts
most
potent
antiviral
activity
after
virus
entry
during
an
early
step
of
the
viral
life
cycle
.

Specifically
,
the
formation
of
double
membrane
vesicles
(
DMVs
)
,
a
hallmark
of
coronavirus
replication
,
was
greatly
impaired
upon
K22
treatment
accompanied
by
near-complete
inhibition
of
viral
RNA
synthesis
.

K22-resistant
viruses
contained
substitutions
in
non-structural
protein
6
(
nsp6
)
,
a
membrane-spanning
integral
component
of
the
viral
replication
complex
implicated
in
DMV
formation
,
corroborating
that
K22
targets
membrane
bound
viral
RNA
synthesis
.

Besides
K22
resistance
,
the
nsp6
mutants
induced
a
reduced
number
of
DMVs
,
displayed
decreased
specific
infectivity
,
while
RNA
synthesis
was
not
affected
.

Importantly
,
K22
inhibits
a
broad
range
of
coronaviruses
,
including
Middle
East
respiratory
syndrome
coronavirus
(
MERS-CoV
)
,
and
efficient
inhibition
was
achieved
in
primary
human
epithelia
cultures
representing
the
entry
port
of
human
coronavirus
infection
.

Collectively
,
this
study
proposes
an
evolutionary
conserved
step
in
the
life
cycle
of
positive-stranded
RNA
viruses
,
the
recruitment
of
cellular
membranes
for
viral
replication
,
as
vulnerable
and
,
most
importantly
,
druggable
target
for
antiviral
intervention
.

We
expect
this
mode
of
action
to
serve
as
a
paradigm
for
the
development
of
potent
antiviral
drugs
to
combat
many
animal
and
human
virus
infections
.

The
giant
triton
snail
(
Charonia
tritonis
)
is
one
of
the
few
natural
predators
of
the
adult
Crown-of-Thorns
starfish
(
COTS
)
,
a
corallivore
that
has
been
damaging
to
many
reefs
in
the
Indo-Pacific
.

Charonia
species
have
large
salivary
glands
(
SGs
)
that
are
suspected
to
produce
either
a
venom
and/or
sulphuric
acid
which
can
immobilize
their
prey
and
neutralize
the
intrinsic
toxic
properties
of
COTS
.

To
date
,
there
is
little
information
on
the
types
of
toxins
produced
by
tritons
.

In
this
paper
,
the
predatory
behaviour
of
the
C.
tritonis
is
described
.

Then
,
the
C.
tritonis
SG
,
which
itself
is
made
up
of
an
anterior
lobe
(
AL
)
and
posterior
lobe
(
PL
)
,
was
analyzed
using
an
integrated
transcriptomics
and
proteomics
approach
,
to
identify
putative
toxin-and
feeding-related
proteins
.

A
de
novo
transcriptome
database
and
in
silico
protein
analysis
predicts
that
~3800
proteins
have
features
consistent
with
being
secreted
.

A
gland-specific
proteomics
analysis
confirmed
the
presence
of
numerous
SG-AL
and
SG-PL
proteins
,
including
those
with
similarity
to
cysteine-rich
venom
proteins
.

Sulfuric
acid
biosynthesis
enzymes
were
identified
,
specific
to
the
SG-PL
.

Our
analysis
of
the
C.
tritonis
SG
(
AL
and
PL
)
has
provided
a
deeper
insight
into
the
biomolecular
toolkit
used
for
predation
and
feeding
by
C.
tritonis
.

If
a
generalist
predator
evolves
to
a
more
a
specialist
diet
,
it
is
assumed
that
it
would
be
accompanied
by
modifications
of
characters
that
permit
greater
efficiency
in
capturing
specific
prey
species
.

These
likely
include
foraging
behaviors
and
search
strategies
with
fine-tuned
chemosensory
systems
,
physiological
processes
associated
with
digestion
and
waste
removal
,
and
other
features
involved
with
prey
capture
1
.

Among
predatory
taxa
the
evolution
of
a
specialized
diet
is
likely
to
be
strongly
linked
to
the
evolution
of
venoms
used
to
subdue
prey
.

Although
the
evolution
of
many
of
these
characters
may
be
difficult
to
trace
for
a
species
that
has
evolved
a
restricted
diet
,
the
evolution
of
venoms
can
be
inferred
from
analyses
of
expression
of
genes
encoding
venom
and
digestion
components
2
,

.

Marine
organisms
from
a
broad
range
of
phyla
,
from
bacteria
and
algae
to
invertebrates
and
vertebrates
,
are
known
to
produce
toxins
with
high
chemical
diversity
,
divergence
of
which
is
likely
driven
by
speciation
and
diet
4-6
.

Some
examples
include
tetrodotoxins
produced
by
bacteria
found
in
the
saliva
of
the
blue-ringed

,
potent
pore-forming

,
okadaic
acid
produced
by
bacteria
in
marine
sponges

,
and
saponins
(
steroidal

triterpenoid
)
that
are

Although

to
species

Advanced
nucleic
acid-based
technologies
are
powerful
research
tools
for
novel
virus
discovery
but
need
to
be
standardized
for
broader
applications
such
as
virus
detection
in
biological
products
and
clinical
samples
.

We
have
used
well-characterized
retrovirus
stocks
to
evaluate
the
limit
of
detection
(
LOD
)
for
broad-range
PCR
with

)
,

assays

.

The
results
indicated
that
in
the
absence
of
background
cellular
nucleic

,
PLEX-ID
and

had
a

whereas
sensitivity
of

was
10-fold

When

was
spiked
into
a
background
of

,
the
LOD
using

by
RT-PCR
was
10-fold
less

no

be

Background
:
Environmental
factors
have
been
associated
with
transmission
and
survival
of
influenza
viruses
but
no
studies
have
ever
explored
the
role
of
environmental
factors
on
severity
of
influenza
infection
.

We
applied
a
Poisson
regression
model
to
the
mortality
data
of
two
Chinese
metropolitan
cities
located
within
the
subtropical
zone
,
to
calculate
the
influenza
associated
excess
mortality
risks
during
the
periods
with
different
levels
of
temperature
and
humidity
.

The
results
showed
that
high
absolute
humidity
(
measured
by
vapor
pressure
)
was
significantly
(
p
<
0.05
)
associated
with
increased
risks
of
all-cause
and
cardiorespiratory
deaths
,
but
not
with
increased
risks
of
pneumonia
and
influenza
deaths
.

The
association
between
absolute
humidity
and
mortality
risks
was
found
consistent
among
the
two
cities
.

An
increasing
pattern
of
influenza
associated
mortality
risks
was
also
found
across
the
strata
of
low
to
high
relative
humidity
,
but
the
results
were
less
consistent
for
temperature
.

Conclusions
:
These
findings
highlight
the
need
for
people
with
chronic
cardiovascular
and
respiratory
diseases
to
take
extra
caution
against
influenza
during
hot
and
humid
days
in
the
subtropics
and
tropics
.

The
SARS
(
severe
acute
respiratory
syndrome
)
outbreak
was
caused
by
a
coronavirus
(
CoV
)
named
the
SARS-CoV
.

SARS
pathology
is
propagated
both
by
direct
cytotoxic
effects
of
the
virus
and
aberrant
activation
of
the
innate
immune
response
.

Here
,
we
identify
several
mechanisms
by
which
a
SARS-CoV
open
reading
frame
(
ORF
)
activates
intracellular
stress
pathways
and
targets
the
innate
immune
response
.

We
show
that
ORF8b
forms
insoluble
intracellular
aggregates
dependent
on
a
valine
at
residue
77
.

Aggregated
ORF8b
induces
endoplasmic
reticulum
(
ER
)
stress
,
lysosomal
damage
,
and
subsequent
activation
of
the
master
regulator
of
the
autophagy
and
lysosome
machinery
,
Transcription
factor
EB
(
TFEB
)
.

ORF8b
causes
cell
death
in
epithelial
cells
,
which
is
partially
rescued
by
reducing
its
ability
to
aggregate
.

In
macrophages
,
ORF8b
robustly
activates
the
NLRP3
inflammasome
by
providing
a
potent
signal
2
required
for
activation
.

Mechanistically
,
ORF8b
interacts
directly
with
the
Leucine
Rich
Repeat
domain
of
NLRP3
and
localizes
with
NLRP3
and
ASC
in
cytosolic
dot-like
structures
.

ORF8b
triggers
cell
death
consistent
with
pyroptotic
cell
death
in
macrophages
.

While
in
those
cells
lacking
NLRP3
accumulating
ORF8b
cytosolic
aggregates
cause
ER
stress
,
mitochondrial
dysfunction
,
and
caspase-independent
cell
death
.

Mammalian
reovirus
is
a
double-stranded
RNA
virus
that
selectively
infects
and
lyses
transformed
cells
,
making
it
an
attractive
oncolytic
agent
.

Despite
clinical
evidence
for
anti-tumor
activity
,
its
efficacy
as
a
stand-alone
therapy
remains
to
be
improved
.

The
success
of
future
trials
can
be
greatly
influenced
by
the
identification
and
the
regulation
of
the
cellular
pathways
that
are
important
for
reovirus
replication
and
oncolysis
.

Here
,
we
demonstrate
that
reovirus
induces
autophagy
in
several
cell
lines
,
evident
from
the
formation
of
Atg5-Atg12
complexes
,
microtubule-associated
protein

light
chain

,
p62
degradation
,
the
appearance
of
acidic
vesicular
organelles
,
and
LC3
puncta
.

Furthermore
,
in
electron
microscopic
images
of
reovirus-infected
cells
,
autophagosomes
were
observed
without
evident
association
with
viral
factories
.

Using
UV-inactivated
reovirus
,
we
demonstrate
that
a
productive
reovirus
infection
facilitates
the
induction
of
autophagy
.

Importantly
,
knock-out
cell
lines
for
specific
autophagy-related
genes
revealed
that
the
expression
of
Atg3
and
Atg5
but
not
Atg13
facilitates
reovirus
replication
.

These
findings
highlight
a
central
and
Atg13-independent
role
for
the
autophagy
machinery
in
facilitating
reovirus
infection
and

to
a
better
understanding

Background
:
Adenoviruses
are
common
pathogens
in
vertebrates
,
including
humans
.

In
marine
mammals
,
adenovirus
has
been
associated
with
fatal
hepatitis
in
sea
lions
.

However
,
only
in
rare
cases
have
adenoviruses
been
detected
in
cetaceans
,
where
no
clear
correlation
was
found
between
presence
of
the
virus
and
disease
status
.

Case
presentation
:
A
novel
adenovirus
was
identified
in
four
captive
bottlenose
dolphins
with
self-limiting
gastroenteritis
.

Viral
detection
and
identification
were
achieved
by
:
PCR-amplification
from
fecal
samples
;
sequencing
of
partial
adenovirus
polymerase
(

with
sequencing
of
the
amplified
pol
and
hexon
gene
fragments

captive
population
;
and

)
the
virus
disappeared
from
feces
after
clinical
signs
receded
.

The
partial
sequences
of
the
amplified
fragments
of
the
pol
and
hexon
genes
were
closest
to
those
of
adenoviruses
identified
in
sea
lions
with
fatal
adenoviral
hepatitis
,
and
to
a
Genbank-deposited
sequence
obtained
from
a
harbour
porpoise
.

Conclusion
:
These
data
suggest
that
adenovirus
can
cause
self-limiting
gastroenteritis
in
dolphins
.

This
adenoviral
infection
can
be
detected
by
serology
and
by
PCR
detection
in
fecal
material
.

Lack
of
signs
of
hepatitis
in
sick
dolphins
may
reflect
restricted
tissue
tropism
or
virulence
of
this
adenovirus
compared
to
those
of
the
adenovirus
identified
in
sea
lions
.

Gene
sequence-based
phylogenetic
analysis
supports
a
common
origin
of
adenoviruses
that
affect
sea
mammals
.

Our
findings
suggest
the
need
for
vigilance
against
adenoviruses

captive
and
wild
dolphin
populations

Peste

dampens
host
interferon-based
signaling
pathways
through
multiple
mechanisms
.

Previous
studies
deciphered
the
role
of
V
and
C
in
abrogating
IFN-β
production
.

Moreover
,
V
protein
directly
interacted
with
signal
transducers
and
activators
of
transcription
1
(
STAT1
)
and
STAT2
resulting
in
the
impairment
of
host
IFN
responses
.

In
our
present
study
,
PPRV
infection
inhibited
both
IFN-β-and
IFN-γ-induced
activation
of
IFN-stimulated
response
element
(
ISRE
)
and
IFN-γ-activated

element
,
respectively
.

Both
N
and
P
proteins
,
functioning
as
novel
IFN
response
antagonists
,
markedly
suppressed
IFN-β-induced
ISRE
and
IFN-γ-induced
GAS
promoter
activation
to
impair
downstream
upregulation
of
various
interferon-stimulated
genes
(
ISGs
)
and
prevent
STAT1
nuclear
translocation
.

Specifically
,
P
protein
interacted
with
STAT1
and
subsequently
inhibited
STAT1
phosphorylation
,
whereas
N
protein
neither
interacted
with
STAT1
nor
inhibited
STAT1
phosphorylation
as
well
as
dimerization
,
suggesting
that
the
N
and
P
protein
antagonistic
effects
were
different
.

Though
they
differed
in
their
relationship
to
STAT1
,
both
proteins
blocked
JAK-STAT
signaling
,
severely
negating
the
host
antiviral
immune
response
.

Our
study
revealed
a
new
mechanism
employed
by
PPRV
to
evade
host
innate
immune
response

The
first
case
of
coronavirus
disease
2019
in
Japan
was
reported
on
15
January
2020
and
the
number
of
reported
cases
has
increased
day
by

.

The
purpose
of
this
study
is
to
give
a
prediction
of
the
epidemic
peak
for
COVID-19
in
Japan
by
using
the
real-time
data
from
15
January
to
29
February
2020
.

Taking
into
account
the
uncertainty
due
to
the
incomplete
identification
of
infective
population
,
we
apply
the
well-known
SEIR
compartmental
model
for
the
prediction
.

By
using
a
least-square-based
method
with
Poisson
noise
,
we
estimate
that
the
basic
reproduction
number
for
the
epidemic
in
Japan
is
R
0
=
2.6
(
95
%
CI
,
2.4-2.8
)
and
the
epidemic
peak
could
possibly
reach
the
early-middle
summer
.

In
addition
,
we
obtain
the
following
epidemiological
insights
:
(
1
)
the
essential
epidemic
size
is
less
likely
to
be
affected
by
the
rate
of
identification
of
the
actual
infective
population
;
(
2
)
the
intervention
has
a
positive
effect
on
the
delay
of
the
epidemic
peak
;
(
3
)
intervention
over
a
relatively
long
period
is
needed
to
effectively
reduce
the
final
epidemic
size
.

The
induction
of
a
strong
mucosal
immune
response
is
essential
to
building
successful
HIV
vaccines
.

Highly
attenuated
recombinant
HIV
vaccinia
virus
can
be
administered
mucosally
,
but
even
high
doses
of
immunization
have
been
found
unable
to
induce
strong
mucosal
antibody
responses
.

In
order
to
solve
this
problem
,
we
studied
the
interactions
of
recombinant
HIV
vaccinia
virus
Tiantan
strain
(
rVTT-gagpol
)
in
mucosal
epithelial
cells
(
specifically
Caco-2
cell
layers
)
and
in
BALB/c
mice
.

We
evaluated
the
impact
of
this
virus
on
HIV
antigen
delivery
and
specific
immune
responses
.

The
results
demonstrated
that
rVTT-gagpol
was
able
to
infect
Caco-2
cell
layers
and
both
the
nasal
and
lung
epithelia
in
BALB/c
mice
.

The
progeny
viruses
and
expressed
p24
were
released
mainly
from
apical
surfaces
.

In
BALB/c
mice
,
the
infection
was
limited
to
the
respiratory
system
and
was
not
observed
in
the
blood
.

This
showed
that
polarized
distribution
limited
antigen
delivery
into
the
whole
body
and
thus
limited
immune
response
.

To
see
if
this
could
be
improved
upon
,
we
stimulated
unpolarized
budding
of
the
virus
and
HIV
antigens
by
treating
both
Caco-2
cells
and
BALB/c
mice
with
colchicine
.

We
found
that
,
in
BALB/c
mice
,
the
degree
of
infection
and
antigen
expression
in
the
epithelia
went
up
.

As
a
result
,
specific
immune
responses
increased
correspondingly
.

Together
,
these
data
suggest
that
polarized
budding
limits
antigen
delivery
and
immune
responses
,
but
unpolarized
distribution
can
increase
antigen
expression
and
delivery
and
thus
enhance
specific
immune
responses
.

This
conclusion
can
be
used
to
optimize
mucosal
HIV
vaccine
strategies
.

Background
:
Avian
influenza
(
AI
)
is
a
public
health
challenge
because
of
ongoing
spread
and
pandemic
potential
.

Non-pharmaceutical
measures
are
important
to
prevent
the
spread
of
AI
and
to
contain
a
pandemic
.

The
effectiveness
of
such
measures
is
largely
dependent
on
the
behaviour
of
the
population
.

Risk
perception
is
a
central
element
in
changing
behaviour
.

This
study
aimed
to
investigate
perceived
vulnerability
,
severity
and
precautionary
behaviour
related
to
AI
in
the
Netherlands
during
seven
consecutive
surveys
in
2006
-2007
as
well
as
possible
trends
in
risk
perception
and
self-reported
precautionary
behaviours
.

Methods
:
Seven
web-based
surveys
were
conducted
including
3,840
respondents
over
a
one-year
period
.

Time
trends
were
analyzed
with
linear
regression
analyses
.

Multivariate
analysis
was
used
to
study
determinants
of
precautionary
behaviour
.

Results
:
While
infection
with
AI
was
considered
a
very
severe
health
problem
with
mean
score
of
4.57
(
scale
1
-5
)
;
perceived
vulnerability
was
much
lower
,
with
a
mean
score
of
1.69
.

While
perceived
severity
remained
high
,
perceived
vulnerability
decreased
slightly
during
a
one-year
period
covering
part
of
2006
and
2007
.

Almost
half
of
the
respondents
(
46
%
)
reported
taking
one
or
more
preventive
measures
,
with
36
%
reporting
to
have
stayed
away
from
(
wild
)
birds
or
poultry
.

In
multivariate
logistic
regression
analysis
the
following
factors
were
significantly
associated
with
taking
preventive
measures
:
time
of
the
survey
,
higher
age
,
lower
level
of
education
,
non-Dutch
ethnicity
,
vaccinated
against
influenza
,
higher
perceived
severity
,
higher
perceived
vulnerability
,
higher
self
efficacy
,
lower
level
of
knowledge
,
more
information
about
AI
,
and
thinking
more
about
AI
.

Self
efficacy
was
a
stronger
predictor
of
precautionary
behaviour
for
those
who
never
or
seldom
think
about
AI
(
OR
2.3
,
95
%
CI
1.9
-2.7
)
,
compared
to
those
who
think
about
AI
more
often
(
OR
1.5
,
95
%
CI
1.2
-1.9
)
.

The
fact
that
perceived
severity
of
AI
appears
to
be
high
and
remains
so
over
time
offers
a
good
point
of
departure
for
more
specific
risk
communications
to
promote
precautionary
actions
.

Such
communications
should
aim
at
improving
knowledge
about
the
disease
and
preventive
actions
,
and
focus
on
perceived
personal
vulnerability
and
self
efficacy
in
taking
preventive
measures
.

Several
clinical
scoring
systems
for
diagnosis
of
bovine

disease
(
BRD
)
in
calves
have
been
proposed
.

However
,
such
systems
were
based
on
subjective
judgment
,
rather
than
statistical
methods
,
to
weight
scores
.

Data
from
a
pair-matched
case-control
study
on
a
California
calf
raising
facility
was
used
to
develop
three
novel
scoring
systems
to
diagnose
BRD
in
preweaned
dairy
calves
.

Disease
status
was
assigned
using
both
clinical
signs
and
diagnostic
test
results
for
BRD-associated
pathogens
.

Regression
coefficients
were
used
to
weight
score
values
.

The
systems
presented
use
nasal
and
ocular
discharge
,
rectal
temperature
,
ear
and
head
carriage
,
coughing
,
and
respiratory
quality
as
predictors
.

The
systems
developed
in
this
research
utilize
fewer
severity
categories
of
clinical
signs
,
require
less
calf
handling
,
and
had
excellent
agreement
(
Kappa
>
0.8
)
when
compared
to
an
earlier
scoring
system
.

The
first
scoring
system
dichotomized
all
clinical
predictors
but
required
inducing
a
cough
.

The
second
scoring
system
removed
induced
cough
as
a
clinical
abnormality
but
required
distinguishing
between
three
levels
of
nasal
discharge
severity
.

The
third
system
removed
induced
cough
and
forced
a
dichotomized
variable
for
nasal
discharge
.

The
first
system
presented
in
this
study
used
the
following
predictors
and
assigned
values
:
coughing

Background

The

Disease
Surveillance
cooperation
(
MBDS
)
is
one
of
several
sub-regional
disease
surveillance
networks
that
have
emerged
in
recent
years
as
an
approach
to
transnational
cooperation
for
infectious
disease
prevention
and
control
.

Since
2003
MBDS
has
pioneered
a
unique
model
for
local
cross-border
cooperation
.

This
study
examines
stakeholders
'
perspectives
of
these
MBDS
experiences
,
based
on
a
survey
of
local
managers
and
semi-structured
interviews
with
MBDS
leaders
and
the
central
coordinator
.

Results
:
Fifteen
managers
from
12
of
20
paired
cross-border
sites
completed
a
written
survey
.

They
all

most
or
all
of
the
17
diseases
agreed
upon
for
MBDS
surveillance

.

Fourteen
agreed
or
strongly
agreed
with
statements
about
the
core
MBDS
values
of
cooperation
,
mutual
trust
,
and
transparency
,
and
their
own
contributions
to
national
and
regional
disease
control
(
average
score
of
4.4
of
5.0
)
.

Respondents
felt
they
implemented
well
to
very
well
activities
related
to
surveillance
reporting
(
average
scores
3.4
to
3.9

)
,
using
computers
for
their
work
(
3.9/4.0
)
,
and
using
surveillance
data
for
action
(
3.8/4.0
)
.

Respondents
reported
that
they
did
worst
in
implementing
research
(
2.1/4.0
)
and
somewhat
poorly
for
local
laboratory
testing
(
2.9/4.0
)
and
local
coordination
with
cross-border
counterparts
(
2.9/4.0
)
,
although
all
15
maintain
a
list
with
contact
information
for
these
counterparts
and
many
know
their
counterparts
.

Implementation
of
specified
activities
within
their
collective
regional
action
plan
was
uneven
across
the
cross-border
sites
.

Most
respondents
reported
positive
lessons
learned
about
local
cooperation
,
information
sharing
and
joint
problem
solving
,
based
on
trusting
relationships
with
their
cross-border
counterparts
.

They
recommend
expansion
of
cross-border
sites
within
MBDS
and
consideration
of
the
cross-border
cooperation
model
by
other
sub-regional
networks
.

Conclusions
:
MBDS
has
over
a
decade
of
experience
with
its
model
of
local
cross-border
cooperation
in
disease
surveillance
and
control
.

Frontline
managers
have
documented
success
with
this
model
,
strongly
support
it
and
recommend
its
expansion
within
and
beyond
the
MBDS
network
.

The
MBDS
cross-border
cooperation
model
is
standing
the
test
of
time
as
a
solid
approach
to
building
and
sustaining
the
public
health
capabilities
needed
for
disease
surveillance
and
control
from
the
local
to
national
and
global
levels
.

The
risk
of
Middle
East
Respiratory
Syndrome
Coronavirus
spreading
globally
is
worrying
,
given
the
annual
mass
gathering
of
the
Hajj
and
the
year-long
influx
of
pilgrims
undertaking
the
Umrah
.

Based
on
the
incidence
in
Saudi
Arabia
since
June
2012
,
the
most
likely
scenario
given
recent
pilgrim
numbers
is
estimated
to
be
one
case
per
Hajj
,
and
three
Umrah
pilgrims
per
year
,
but
which
could
plausibly
reach
seven
and
ten
pilgrims
respectively
.

In
addition
to
the
2015
Hajj
,
national
surveillance
systems
should
be
on
the
alert
for
the
low
but
long-lasting
risk
of
infected
pilgrims
returning
from
the
Umrah
throughout
the
year
.

and
human
metapneumovirus
(
hMPV
)
are
important
viral
pathogens
causing
respiratory
tract
infection
(
RTI
)
in
the
pediatric
population
.

However
,
the
clinical
manifestations
of
RSV
and
hMPV
infections
are
similar
.

Therefore
,
a
reliable
and
rapid
diagnostic
tool
is
needed
for
diagnostic
performance
.

Methods
:
In
order
to
optimize
diagnosis
efficiency
of
RTI
,
the
aim
of
this
study
is
to
establish
a
rapid
and
advanced
method
for
simultaneous
detecting
RSV
and
hMPV
in
nasopharyngeal
aspirates
specimens
from
patients
.

We
designed
a
one-step
triplex
real-time
RT-PCR
(
qRT-PCR
)
protocol
using
TaqMan
probes
for
detecting
RSV
and
hMPV
.

The
plasmid
clones
containing
RSV
nucleoprotein
gene
and
hMPV
fusion
gene
were
established
as
reference
standards
.

We
used
virus
culture
supernatants
from
86
known
pediatric
RTI
patient
to
test
the
specificity
and
sensitivity
of
our
assay
.

Then
we
used
total
222
nasopharyngeal
aspirates
specimens
from
pediatric
patients
hospitalized
with
respiratory
symptoms
to
evaluate
our
assay
.

Results
:
Our
one-step
triplex
qRT-PCR
assay
showed
100
%
sensitivity
and
specificity
in
testing
RSV
and
hMPV
in
86
known
virus
culture
supernatants
,
with
excellent
linearity
(
R
2
>
0.99
)
and
reliable
reproducibility
(
CV
lower
than
1.04
%
)
.

This
assay
has
a
wide
dynamic
range

-10
9
copies/reaction
(
limit
of
detection
;
LOD
=
100
copies/reaction
)
.

A
total
of
222
patients
hospitalized
with
respiratory
symptoms
were
enrolled
for
clinical
evaluation
.

In
these
samples
,
our
qRT-PCR
assay
detected
68
RSV
positive
and
18
hMPV
positive
cases
.

However
,
standard
virus
culture
only
detected
8
RSV
positive
cases
and
0
hMPV
cases
.

Based
on
this
improved
triplex
qRT-PCR
assay
,
we
found
that
RSV
infection
was
associated
with
severe
inflammation
by
chest
X-ray
and
occurrence
of
pneumonia
which
were
not
observed
previously
.

In
summary
,
we
have
developed
a
highly
specific
and
sensitive
one-step
triplex
qRT-PCR
assay
to
detect
hMPV
and
RSV
simultaneously
.

This
assay
offers
a
valuable
tool
for
routine
diagnosis
.

Diarrhea
,
caused
by
porcine
epidemic
diarrhea
virus
(
PEDV
)
,
is
a
catastrophic
gastrointestinal
disease
among
suckling
piglets
,
with
high
infectivity
,
morbidity
,
and
mortality
,
causing
huge
economic
losses
to
the
pig
industry
.

In
the
present
study
,
we
investigated
the
different
microbiota
from
the
cecal
mucosa
and
cecal
contents
between
healthy
and
PEDV-infected
piglets
.

High-throughput
16S
rRNA
gene
sequencing
was
performed
to
explore
differences
.

The
results
revealed
that
microbial
dysbiosis
by
PEDV
infection
occurred
in
the
cecal
mucosa
and
contents
of
suckling
piglets
at
each
microbial
taxonomic
level
.

The
abundance
of
pathogenic
bacteria
associated
with
diseases
,
including
diarrhea
,
was
increased
.

The
abundance
of
Fusobacterium
was
26.71
%
and
33.91
%
in
cecal
mucosa
and
contents
of
PEDV-infected
group
,
respectively
,
whereas
that
in
the
healthy
groups
was
17.85
%
and
9.88
%
.

The
proportion
of
Proteobacteria
in
the
infected
groups
was
relatively
high
(
24.67
%
and
22.79
%
,
respectively
)
,
whereas
that
in
the
healthy
group
was
13.13
%
and
11.34
%
in
the
cecal
mucosa
and
contents
,
respectively
.

Additionally
,
the
proportion
of
Bacteroidetes
in
the
healthy
group
(
29.89
%
,
37.32
%
)
was
approximately
twice
that
of
the
PEDV-infected
group
(
15.50
%
,
15.39
%
)
.

were
the
enriched
functional
annotation
terms
in
the
PEDV-infected
groups
.

Porcine
epidemic
diarrhea
virus
infection
increased
the
proportion
of
harmful
bacteria
and
decreased
the
proportion
of
beneficial
bacteria
in
the
cecal
mucosa
and
contents
of
suckling
piglets
.

Our
findings
suggest
that
determining
the
intestinal
microbiota
might
provide
a
promising
method
to
prevent
PEDV
and
open
a
new
avenue

Around
10,000
people
die
each
year
due
to
severe
dengue
disease
,
and
two-thirds
of
the
world
population
lives
in
a
region
where
dengue
disease
is
endemic
.

There
has
been
remarkable
progress
in
dengue
virus
vaccine
development
;
however
,
there
are
no
licensed
antivirals
for
dengue
disease
,
and
none
appear
to
be
in
clinical
trials
.

We
took
the
approach
of
repositioning
approved
drugs
for
anti-dengue
virus
activity
by
screening
a
library
of
pharmacologically
active
compounds
.

We
identified
N-desmethylclozapine
,
fluoxetine
hydrochloride
,
and
salmeterol
xinafoate
as
dengue
virus
inhibitors
based
on
reductions
in
the
numbers
of
infected
cells
and
viral
titers
.

Dengue
virus
RNA
levels
were
diminished
in
inhibitor-treated
cells
,
and
this
effect
was
specific
to
dengue
virus
,
as
other
flaviviruses
,
such
as
Japanese
encephalitis
virus
and
West
Nile
virus
,
or
other
RNA
viruses
,
such
as
respiratory
syncytial
virus
and
rotavirus
,
were
not
affected
by
these
inhibitors
.

All
three
inhibitors
specifically
inhibited
dengue
virus
replication
with
50
%
inhibitory
concentrations
(
IC
50
s
)
in
the
high-nanomolar
range
.

Estimation
of
negative-strand
RNA
intermediates
and
time-of-addition
experiments
indicated
that
inhibition
was
occurring
at
a
postentry
stage
,
most
probably
at
the
initiation
of
viral
RNA
replication
.

Finally
,
we
show
that
inhibition
is
most
likely
due
to
the
modulation
of
the
endolysosomal
pathway
and
induction
of
autophagy
.

Acute
viral
wheeze
in
children
is
a
major
cause
of
hospitalisation
and
a
major
risk
factor
for
the
development
of
asthma
.

However
,
the
role
of
the
respiratory
tract
microbiome
in
the
development
of
acute
wheeze
is
unclear
.

To
investigate
whether
severe
wheezing
episodes
in
children
are
associated
with
bacterial
dysbiosis
in
the
respiratory
tract
,
oropharyngeal
swabs
were
collected
from
109
children
with
acute
wheezing
attending
the
only
tertiary
paediatric
hospital
in
Perth
,
Australia
.

The
bacterial
community
from
these
samples
was
explored
using
next
generation
sequencing
and
compared
to
samples
from
75
non-wheezing
controls
.

No
significant
difference
in
bacterial
diversity
was
observed
between
samples
from
those
with
wheeze
and
healthy
controls
.

Within
the
wheezing
group
,
attendance
at
kindergarten
or
preschool
was
however
,
associated
with
increased
bacterial
diversity
.

Rhinovirus
(
RV
)
infection
did
not
have
a
significant
effect
on
bacterial
community
composition
.

A
significant
difference
in
bacterial
richness
was
observed
between
children
with
RV-A
and
RV-C
infection
,
however
this
is
likely
due
to
the
differences
in
age
group
between
the
patient
cohorts
.

The
bacterial
community
within
the
oropharynx
was
found
to
be
diverse
and
heterogeneous
.

Age
and
attendance
at
day
care
or
kindergarten
were
important
factors
in
driving
bacterial
diversity
.

However
,
wheeze
and
viral
infection
were
not
found
to
significantly
relate
to
the
bacterial
community
.

Bacterial
airway
microbiome
is
highly
variable
in
early
life
and
its
role
in
wheeze
remains
less
clear
than
viral
influences
.

Background
:
The
Ministry
of
Health
and
Sanitation
(
MOHS
)
in
Sierra
Leone
partially
rolled
out
the
implementation
of
Integrated
Disease
Surveillance
and
Response
(
IDSR
)
in
2003
.

After
the
Ebola
virus
disease
outbreak
in
2014-2015
,
there
was
need
to
strengthen
IDSR
to
ensure
prompt
detection
and
response
to
epidemic-prone
diseases
.

We
describe
the
processes
,
successes
and
challenges
of
revitalizing
public
health
surveillance
in
a
country
recovering
from
a
protracted
Ebola
virus
disease
outbreak
.

Methods
:
The
revitalization
process
began
with
adaptation
of
the
revised
IDSR
guidelines
and
development
of
customized
guidelines
to
suit
the
health
care
systems
in
Sierra
Leone
.

Public
health
experts
defined
data
flow
,
system
operations
,
case
definitions
,
frequency
and
channels
of
reporting
and
dissemination
.

Next
,
phased
training
of
IDSR
focal
persons
in
each
health
facility
and
the
distribution
of
data
collection
and
reporting
tools
was
done
.

Monitoring
activities
included
periodic
supportive
supervision
and
data
quality
assessments
.

Rapid
response
teams
were
formed
to
investigate
and
respond
to
disease
outbreak
alerts
in
all
districts
.

Results
:
Submission
of
reports
through
the
IDSR
system
began
in
mid-2015
and
by
the
35th
epidemiologic
week
,
all
district
health
teams
were
submitting
reports
.

The
key
performance
indicators
measuring
the
functionality
of
the
IDSR
system
in
2016
and
2017
were
achieved
(
WHO
Africa
Region
target
≥80
%
)
;
the
annual
average
proportion
of
timely
weekly
health
facility
reports
submitted
to
the
next
level
was
93
%
in
2016
and
97
%
in
2017
;
the
proportion
of
suspected
outbreaks
and
public
health
events
detected
through
the
IDSR
system
was
96
%
(
n
=
87
)
in
2016
and
100
%
(
n
=
85
)
in
2017
.

Conclusion
:
With
proper
planning
,
phased
implementation
and
adequate
investment
of
resources
,
it
is
possible
to
establish
a
functional
IDSR
system
in
a
country
recovering
from
a
public
health
crisis
.

A
functional
IDSR
system
requires
well
trained
workforce
,
provision
of
the
necessary
tools
and
guidelines
,
information
,
communication
and
technology
infrastructure
to
support
data
transmission
,
provision
of
timely
feedback
as
well
as
logistical
support
.

Electron
microscopy
(
EM
)
should
be
used
in
the
front
line
for
detection
of
agents
in
emergencies
and
bioterrorism
,
on
accounts
of
its
speed
and
accuracy
.

However
,
the
number
of
EM
diagnostic
laboratories
has
decreased
considerably
and
an
increasing
number
of
people
encounter
difficulties
with
EM
results
.

Therefore
,
the
research
on
viral
structure
and
morphology
has
become
important
in
EM
diagnostic
practice
.

EM
has
several
technological
advantages
,
and
should
be
a
fundamental
tool
in
clinical
diagnosis
of
viruses
,
particularly
when
agents
are
unknown
or
unsuspected
.

In
this
article
,
we
review
the
historical
contribution
of
EM
to
virology
,
and
its
use
in
virus
differentiation
,
localization
of
specific
virus
antigens
,
virus-cell
interaction
,
and
viral
morphogenesis
.

It
is
essential
that
EM
investigations
are
based
on
clinical
and
comprehensive
pathogenesis
data
from
light
or
confocal
microscopy
.

Furthermore
,
avoidance
of
artifacts
or
false
results
is
necessary
to
exploit
fully
the
advantages
while
minimizing
its
limitations

We
sometimes
decide
to
take
an
offered
option
that
results
in
apparent
loss
(
e.g.
,
unpaid
overtime
)
.

Mainstream
decision
theory
does
not
predict
or
explain
this
as
a
choice
we
want
to
make
,
whereas
such
a
choice
has
long
been
described
and
highly
regarded
by
the
traditional
Chinese
dogma
``
吃亏是福
''
(
suffering
a
loss
is
good
fortune
)
.

To
explore
what
makes
the
dogma
work
,
we
developed
a
celebrity
anecdote-based
scale
to
measure
``
Chikui
''
(
suffering
a
loss
)
likelihood
and
found
that
:
(
i
)
people
with
higher
scores
on
the
Chikui
Likelihood
Scale
(
CLS
)
were
more
likely
to
report
higher
scores
on
subjective
well-being
and
the
Socioeconomic
Index
for
the
present
and
(
ii
)
the
current
Socioeconomic
Index
could
be
positively
predicted
not
only
by
current
CLS
scores
but
also
by
retrospective
CLS
scores
recalled
for
the
past
,
and
the
predictive
effect
was
enhanced
with
increasing
time
intervals
.

Our
findings
suggest
that
``
suffering
a
loss
is
good
fortune
''
is
not
a
myth
but
a
certain
reality
.

Foamy
viruses
(
FV
)
belong
to
the
genus
Spumavirus
,
which
forms
a
distinct
lineage
in
the
Retroviridae
family
.

Although
the
infection
in
natural
hosts
and
zoonotic
transmission
to
humans
is
asymptomatic
,
FVs
can
replicate
well
in
human
cells
making
it
an
attractive
gene
therapy
vector
candidate
.

The

A
mysterious
outbreak
of
atypical
pneumonia
in
late
2019
was
traced
to
a
seafood
wholesale
market
in
Wuhan
of
China
.

Within
a
few
weeks
,
a
novel
coronavirus
tentatively
named
as
2019
novel
coronavirus
(
2019-nCoV
)
was
announced
by
the
World
Health
Organization
.

We
performed
bioinformatics
analysis
on
a
virus
genome
from
a
patient
with
2019-nCoV
infection
and
compared
it
with
other
related
coronavirus
genomes
.

Overall
,
the
genome
of
2019-nCoV
has
89
%
nucleotide
identity
with
bat
SARS-like-CoVZXC21
and
82
%
with
that
of
human
SARS-CoV
.

The
phylogenetic
trees
of
their
orf1a/b
,
Spike
,
Envelope
,
Membrane
and
Nucleoprotein
also
clustered
closely
with
those
of
the
bat
,
civet
and
human
SARS

.

However
,
the
external
subdomain
of
Spike

of
2019-nCoV
shares
only
40
%
amino
acid
identity
with
other
SARS-related
coronaviruses
.

Remarkably
,
its
orf3b
encodes
a
completely
novel
short
protein
.

Furthermore
,
its
new
orf8
likely
encodes
a
secreted
protein
with
an
alpha-helix
,
following
with
a

containing
six

Learning
from
the

,
hunting
for
the
animal
source
of
2019-nCoV
and
its
more

would
be
important
for
understanding
the
origin
and
evolution
of
this
novel
lineage
B
betacoronavirus
.

These
findings
provide
the
basis
for
starting
further
studies
on
the
pathogenesis
,
and
optimizing
the
design
of
diagnostic
,
antiviral
and

strategies
for
this
emerging

.

Although
mosquitoes
serve
as
vectors
of
many
pathogens
of
public
health
importance
,
their
response
to
viral
infection
is
poorly
understood
.

It
also
remains
to
be
investigated
whether
viruses
deploy
some
mechanism
to
be
able
to
overcome
this
immune
response
.

Here
,
we
have
used
an
RNA-Seq
approach
to
identify
differentially
regulated
genes
in
Culex
quinquefasciatus
cells
following
West
Nile
virus
(
WNV
)
infection
,
identifying
265
transcripts
from
various
cellular
pathways
that
were
either
upregulated
or
downregulated
.

Ubiquitin-proteasomal
pathway
genes
,
comprising
12
%
of
total
differentially
regulated
genes
,
were
selected
for
further
validation
by
real
time
RT-qPCR
and
functional
analysis
.

It
was
found
that
treatment
of
infected
cells
with
proteasomal
inhibitor
,
MG-132
,
decreased
WNV
titers
,
indicating
importance
of
this
pathway
during
infection
process
.

In
infection
models
,
the
Culex
ortholog
of
mammalian
Cul4A/B
(
cullin
RING
ubiquitin
ligase
)
was
found
to
be
upregulated
in
vitro
as
well
as
in
vivo
,
especially
in
midguts
of
mosquitoes
.

Gene
knockdown
using
dsRNA
and
overexpression
studies
indicated
that
Culex
Cul4
acts
as
a
pro-viral
protein
by
degradation
of
CxSTAT
via
ubiquitin-proteasomal
pathway
.

We
also
show
that
gene
knockdown
of
Culex
Cul4
leads
to
activation
of
the
Jak-STAT
pathway
in
mosquitoes
leading
to
decrease
viral
replication
in
the
body
as
well
as
saliva
.

Our
results
suggest
a
novel
mechanism
adopted
by
WNV
to
overcome
mosquito
immune
response
and
increase
viral
replication

Pigs
are
often
colonized
by
more
than
one
bacterial
and/or
viral
species
during
respiratory
tract
infections
.

This
phenomenon
is
known
as
the
porcine
respiratory
disease
complex
(
PRDC
)
.

Actinobacillus
pleuropneumoniae
(
App
)
and
porcine
reproductive
and
respiratory
syndrome
virus
(
PRRSV
)
are
pathogens
that
are
frequently
involved
in
PRDC
.

The
main
objective
of
this
project
was
to
study
the
in
vitro
interactions
between
these
two
pathogens
and
the
host
cells
in
the
context
of
mixed
infections
.

To
fulfill
this
objective
,
PRRSV
permissive
cell
lines
such
as
MARC-145
,
SJPL
,
and
porcine
alveolar
macrophages
(
PAM
)
were
used
.

A
pre-infection
with
PRRSV
was
performed
at
0.5
multiplicity
of
infection
(
MOI
)
followed
by
an
infection
with
App
at
10
MOI
.

Bacterial
adherence
and
cell
death
were
compared
.

Results
showed
that
PRRSV
preinfection
did
not
affect
bacterial
adherence
to
the
cells
.

PRRSV
and
App
co-infection
produced
an
additive
cytotoxicity
effect
.

Interestingly
,
a
pre-infection
of
SJPL
and
PAM
cells
with
App
blocked
completely
PRRSV
infection
.

Incubation
of
SJPL
and
PAM
cells
with
an
App
cell-free
culture
supernatant
is
also
sufficient
to
significantly
block
PRRSV
infection
.

This
antiviral
activity
is
not
due
to
LPS
but
rather
by
small
molecular
weight
,
heat-resistant
App
metabolites
(
,1
kDa
)
.

The
antiviral
activity
was
also
observed
in
SJPL
cells
infected
with
swine
influenza
virus
but
to
a
much
lower
extent
compared
to
PRRSV
.

More
importantly
,
the
PRRSV
antiviral
activity
of
App
was
also
seen
with
PAM
,
the
cells
targeted
by
the
virus
in
vivo
during
infection
in
pigs
.

The
antiviral
activity
might
be
due
,
at
least
in
part
,
to
the
production
of
interferon
c.
The
use
of
in

to
a
better
understanding
of
the

TNF/CHP

showed
excellent

enhanced

responses
to

The

were

of
administration
for
inducing

We
applied
the
nanoparticles
in
a

experimental
influenza

infection
to
investigate
their
adjuvant
ability
.

TNF/CHP

combined
with
a

nasal
administration
against
a
lethal
challenge
of
A/PR/8/34
(

Mechanistic
studies
showed
that
the
nanoparticles
enhanced
antigen
uptake
by
dendritic

and
moderately
induced
the
expression

,
leading
to
the

.

Preliminary

study
revealed
no
severe
toxicity
to
TNF/CHP

.

Slight-tomoderate
influences
in
nasal
mucosa
were
observed
only
in
the
repeated
administration
and
they
seemed
to
be
reversible
.

Our
data
show
that
TNF/CHP
nanoparticles
effectively
enhance
both
humoral

cellular
immunity
and
could
be
a

Efficient
antiviral
immunity
requires
interference
with
virus
replication
at
multiple
layers
targeting
diverse
steps
in
the
viral
life
cycle
.

We
describe
here
a
novel
flavivirus
inhibition
mechanism
that
results
in
interferon-mediated
obstruction
of
tick-borne
encephalitis
virus
particle
assembly
and
involves
release
of
malfunctioning
membrane-associated
capsid
(
C
)
particles
.

This
mechanism
is
controlled
by
the
activity
of
the
interferon-induced
protein
viperin
,
a
broad-spectrum
antiviral
interferon-stimulated
gene
.

Through
analysis
of
the
viperin-interactome
,
we
identified
the
Golgi
brefeldin
A-resistant
guanine
nucleotide
exchange
factor
1
(
GBF1
)
as
the
cellular
protein
targeted
by
viperin
.

Viperin-induced
antiviral
activity
,
as
well
as
C-particle
release
,
was
stimulated
by
GBF1
inhibition
and
knockdown
and
reduced
by
elevated
levels
of
GBF1
.

Our
results
suggest
that
viperin
targets
flavivirus
virulence
by
inducing
the
secretion
of
unproductive
noninfectious
virus
particles
via
a
GBF1-dependent
mechanism
.

This
as-yet-undescribed
antiviral
mechanism
allows
potential
therapeutic
intervention
.

Background
:
In
2006
,
Malawi
developed
a
national
influenza
plan
to
mitigate
,
prevent
and
manage
the
burden
of
infection
should
an
outbreak
occur
.

In
2009
,
it
translated
its
contingency
plan
to
respond
to
the
unfolding
influenza
pandemic
.

However
,
little
is
known
of
how
Malawi
translated
its
national
influenza
plan
into
response
actions
,
or
the
success
of
these
responses
.

Objective
:
To
investigate
how
Malawi
translated
its
preparedness
plan
and
so
broaden
our
understanding
of
the
outcomes
of
the
responses
.

Methods
:
We
draw
on
data
from
22
in-depth
interviews
with
government
policymakers
and
people
working
at
a
policy
level
in
various
non-governmental
organisations
,
conducted
to
assess
the
level
of
preparedness
and
the
challenges
of
translating
this
.

Results
:
Through
a
number
of
public
health
initiatives
,
authorities
developed
communication
strategies
,
strengthened
influenza
surveillance
activities
and
updated
overall
goals
in
pandemic
training
and
education
.

However
,
without
influenza
drills
,
exercises
and
simulations
to
test
the
plan
,
activating
the
pandemic
plan
,
including
coordinating
and
deploying
generic
infection
control
measures
,
was
problematic
.

Responses
during
the
pandemic
were
at
times
'weak
and
clumsy
'
and
failed
to
mirror
the
activities
and
processes
highlighted
in
the
preparedness
plan
.

Conclusions
:
Participants
stressed
that
in
order
to
achieve
a
coordinated
and
successful
response
to
mitigate
and
prevent
the
further
transmission
of
pandemic
influenza
,
good
preparation
was
critical
.

The
key
elements
which
they
identified
as
relevant
for
a
rapid
response
included
effective
communications
,
robust
evidence-based
decision-making
,
strong
and
reliable
surveillance
systems
and
flexible
public
health
responses
.

To
effectively
articulate
a
viable
trajectory
of
pandemic
responses
,
the
potential
value
of
simulation
exercises
could
be
given
more
consideration
as
a
mean
of
sustaining
good
levels
of
preparedness
and
responses
against
future
pandemics
.

These
all
demand
a
well-structured
planning
for
and
response
to
pandemic
influenza
strategy
developed
by
a
functioning
scientific
and
policy
advisory
committee
.

ARTICLE
HISTORY

Licorice
,
the
oldest
Chinese
traditional
medicine
,
is
widely
used
in
the
treatment
of
human
diseases
.

Due
to
the
deficiency
of
wild
resource
,
selecting
and
breeding
becomes
a
key
issue
to
expanding
the
supply
of
licorice
.

Spaceflight
technology
will
become
a
new
method
for
medicinal
plants
.

The
aim
of
this
study
was
to
investigate
the
effect
of
spaceflight
on
the
components
and
anti-inflammatory
activity
in
licorice
.

After
flowing
on
a
recoverable
satellite
for
18
days
,
licorice
seeds
were
germinated
and
grown
to
maturity
and
the
parallel
groundbased
seeds
were
also
planted
under
the
same
conditions
.

The
main
components
in
licorice
root
were
analyzed
through
HPLC
.

The
contents
of
two
components
in
spaceflight
groups
were
higher
than
that
of
the
ground
control
ones
.

Three
acute
inflammatory
models
including
xyleneinduced
auricular
edema
,
carrageenan-induced
paw
edema
and
acetic
acid-induced
vascular
permeability
were
utilized
to
compare
the
anti-inflammatory
activity
of
licorice
pre
and
post
spaceflight
.

The
licorice
extract
showed
the
significant
anti-inflammation
activity
.

After
the
spaceflight
,
the
pharmacological
activity
of
licorice
got
higher
than
that
of
the
ground
control
one
.

All
of
the
models
gained
the
tendency
that
the
spaceflight
group
of
species
Hangjinqi
had
the
strongest
activity
than
other
groups
.

The
research
provided
the
scientific
data
for
a
new
breeding
of
medicinal
plant
through
the
spaceflight
and
indicated
that
the
technology
of
space
flight
may
be
a
new
effective
method
for
the
breeding
and
cultivation
of
licorice
.

Identification
of
unknown
pathogens
in
pigs
displaying
enteric
illness
is
difficult
due
to
the
large
diversity
of
bacterial
and
viral
species
found
within
faecal
samples
.

Current
methods
often
require
bacterial
or
viral
isolation
,
or
testing
only
a
limited
number
of
known
species
using
quantitative
PCR
analysis
.

Herein
,
faeces
from
two
25-day-old
piglets
with
diarrhoea
from
Texas
,
USA
,
were
analysed
by
metagenomic
next-generation
sequencing
to
rapidly
identify
possible
pathogens
.

Our
analysis
included
a
bioinformatics
pipeline
of
rapid
short-read
classification
and
de
novo
genome
assembly
which
resulted
in
the
identification
of
a
porcine
enterovirus
G
(
EV-G
)
,
a
complete
genome
with
substantial
nucleotide
differences
(
>
30
%
)
among
current
sequences
,
and
a
novel
non-structural
protein
similar
in
sequence
to
the
Torovirus
papain-like
cysteine
protease
(
PL
pro
)
.

This
discovery
led
to
the
identification
and
circulation
of
an
EV-G
with
a
novel
PL
pro
in
the
USA
that
has
not
been
previously
reported
.

Bats
are
reservoir
hosts
of
several
high-impact
viruses
that
cause
significant
human
diseases
,
including
Nipah
virus
,
Marburg
virus
and
rabies
virus
.

They
also
harbor
many
other
viruses
that
are
thought
to
have
caused
disease
in
humans
after
spillover
into
intermediate
hosts
,
including
SARS
and
MERS
coronaviruses
.

As
is
usual
with
reservoir
hosts
,
these
viruses
apparently
cause
little
or
no
pathology
in
bats
.

Despite
the
importance
of
bats
as
reservoir
hosts
of
zoonotic
and
potentially
zoonotic
agents
,
virtually
nothing
is
known
about
the
host/virus
relationships
;
principally
because
few
colonies
of
bats
are
available
for
experimental
infections
,
a
lack
of
reagents
,
methods
and
expertise
for
studying
bat
antiviral
responses
and
immunology
,
and
the
difficulty
of
conducting
meaningful
field
work
.

These
challenges
can
be
addressed
,
in
part
,
with
new
technologies
that
are
species-independent
that
can
provide
insight
into
the
interactions
of
bats
and
viruses
,
which
should
clarify
how
the
viruses
persist
in
nature
,
and
what
risk
factors
might
facilitate
transmission
to
humans
and
livestock
.

Interferon
(
IFN
)
-induced
transmembrane
protein
3
(
IFITM3
)
is
a
cell-intrinsic
factor
that
limits
influenza
virus
infections
.

We
previously
showed
that
IFITM3
degradation
is
increased
by
its
ubiquitination
,
though
the
ubiquitin
ligase
responsible
for
this
modification
remained
elusive
.

Here
,
we
demonstrate
that
the
E3
ubiquitin
ligase
NEDD4
ubiquitinates
IFITM3
in
cells
and
in
vitro
.

This
IFITM3
ubiquitination
is
dependent
upon
the
presence
of
a
PPxY
motif
within
IFITM3
and
the
WW
domain-containing
region
of
NEDD4
.

In
NEDD4
knockout
mouse
embryonic
fibroblasts
,
we
observed
defective
IFITM3
ubiquitination
and
accumulation
of
high
levels
of
basal
IFITM3
as
compared
to
wild
type
cells
.

Heightened
IFITM3
levels
significantly
protected
NEDD4
knockout
cells
from
infection
by
influenza
A
and
B
viruses
.

Similarly
,
knockdown
of
NEDD4
in
human
lung
cells
resulted
in
an
increase
in
steady
state
IFITM3
and
a
decrease
in
influenza
virus
infection
,
demonstrating
a
conservation
of
this
NEDD4-dependent
IFITM3
regulatory
mechanism
in
mouse
and
human
cells
.

Consistent
with
the
known
association
of
NEDD4
with
lysosomes
,
we
demonstrate
for
the
first
time
that
steady
state
turnover
of
IFITM3
occurs
through
the
lysosomal
degradation
pathway
.

Overall
,
this
work
identifies
the
enzyme
NEDD4
as
a
new
therapeutic
target
for
the
prevention
of
influenza
virus
infections
,
and
introduces
a
new
paradigm
for
up-regulating
cellular
levels
of
IFITM3
independently
of
IFN
or
infection
.

OBJECTIVES
:
Despite
its
extensive
use
,
the
term
¨Surveillance¨
often
takes
on
various
meanings
in
the
scientific
literature
pertinent
to
public
health
and
animal
health
.

A
critical
appraisal
of
this
literature
also
reveals
ambiguities
relating
to
the
scope
and
necessary
structural
components
underpinning
the
surveillance
process
.

The
authors
hypothesized
that
these
inconsistencies
translate
to
real
or
perceived
deficiencies
in
the
conceptual
framework
of
population
health
surveillance
.

This
paper
presents
a
population
health
surveillance
theory
framed
upon
an
explicit
conceptual
system
relative
to
health
surveillance
performed
in
human
and
animal
populations
.

The
population
health
surveillance
theory
reflects
the
authors
'
system
of
thinking
and
was
based
on
a
creative
process
.

Population
health
surveillance
includes
two
broad
components
:
one
relating
to
the
human
organization
(
which
includes
expertise
and
the
administrative
program
)
,
and
one
relating
to
the
system
per
se
(
which
includes
elements
of
design
and
method
)
and
which
can
be
viewed
as
a
process
.

The
population
health
surveillance
process
is
made
of
five
sequential
interrelated
steps
:
1
)
a
trigger
or
need
,
2
)
problem
formulation
,
3
)
surveillance
planning
,
4
)
surveillance
implementation
,
and
5
)
information
communication
and
audit
.

The
population
health
surveillance
theory
provides
a
systematic
way
of
understanding
,
organizing
and
evaluating
the
population
health
surveillance
process
.

The

,
we
report
the

High

were
produced
following
transfection
of
the

bearing
the
wildtype

,

not

with
a

(

)

active
site
.

Multicycle
growth
curve
and
plaque
assay
experiments
indicated
that
the
MR766
virus
resulting
from
plasmid
transfection
exhibited
growth
characteristics
that
were
more
similar
to
its
parental
isolate
than
previously
published
2010
Cambodia
and

This
ZIKV
infectious
clone
will
be
useful
for
investigating
the
genetic
determinants
of
ZIKV
infection
and
pathogenesis
and
should
be
amenable
to
construction
of
diverse
infectious

expressing
reporter
proteins
and
representing
a
range
of

Little
is
known
regarding
the
molecular
epidemiology
of
Middle
East
respiratory
syndrome
coronavirus
(
MERS-CoV
)
circulating
in
dromedaries
outside
Saudi
Arabia
.

To
address
this
knowledge
gap
,
we
sequenced
10
complete
genomes
of
MERS-CoVs
isolated
from
2
live
and
8
dead
dromedaries
from
different
regions
in
the
United
Arab
Emirates
(
UAE
)
.

Phylogenetic
analysis
revealed
one
novel
clade
A
strain
,
the
first
detected
in
the
UAE
,
and
nine
clade
B
strains
.

Strain
D998/15
had
a
distinct
phylogenetic
position
within
clade
A
,
being
more
closely
related
to
the
dromedary
isolate
NRCE-HKU205
from
Egypt
than
to
the
human
isolates
EMC/2012
and
Jordan-N3/2012
.

A
comparison
of
predicted
protein
sequences
also
demonstrated
the
existence
of
two
clade
A
lineages
with
unique
amino
acid
substitutions
,
A1
(
EMC/2012

(

)
,
circulating
in
humans
and
camels
,
respectively
.

The
nine
clade
B
isolates
belong
to
three
distinct
lineages
:
B1
,
B3
and
B5
.

Two
B3
strains
,
D1271/15
and
D1189.1/15
,
showed
evidence
of
recombination
between
lineages
B4
and
B5
in
ORF1ab

The
human
respiratory
tract
is
heavily
exposed
to
microorganisms
.

Viral
respiratory
tract
pathogens
,
like
RSV
,
influenza
and
rhinoviruses
cause
major
morbidity
and
mortality
from
respiratory
tract
disease
.

Furthermore
,
as
viruses
have
limited
means
of
transmission
,
viruses
that
cause
pathogenicity
in
other
tissues
may
be
transmitted
through
the
respiratory

.

It
is
therefore
important
to
chart
the
human
virome
in
this
compartment
.

We
have
studied
nasopharyngeal
aspirate
samples
diagnosis
of
respiratory
tract
infections
.

We
have
used
a
metagenomic
sequencing
strategy
to
characterize
viruses
,
as
this
provides
the
most
unbiased
view
of
the
samples
.

Virus
enrichment
followed
by
454
sequencing
resulted
in
totally
703,790
reads
and
110,931
of
these
were
found
to
be
of
viral
origin
by
using
an
automated
classification
pipeline
.

The
snapshot
of
the
respiratory
tract
virome
of
these
210
patients
revealed
39
species
and
many
more
strains
of
viruses
.

Most
of
the
viral
sequences
were
classified
into
one
of
three
major
families
;
Paramyxoviridae
,
Picornaviridae
or
Orthomyxoviridae
.

The
study
also
identified
one
novel
type
of
Rhinovirus
C
,
and
identified
a
number
of
previously
undescribed
viral
genetic
fragments
of
unknown
origin
.

Human
coronavirus
(
HCoV
)
NL63
was
first
described
in
2004
and
is
associated
with
respiratory
tract
disease
of
varying
severity
.

At
the
genetic
and
structural
level
,
HCoV-NL63
is
similar
to
other
members
of
the
Coronavirinae
subfamily
,
especially
human
coronavirus
229E
(
HCoV-229E
)
.

Detailed
analysis
,
however
,
reveals
several
unique
features
of
the
pathogen
.

The
coronaviral
nucleocapsid
protein
is
abundantly
present
in
infected
cells
.

It
is
a
multi-domain
,
multi-functional
protein
important
for
viral
replication
and
a
number
of
cellular
processes
.

The
aim
of
the
present
study
was
to
characterize
the
HCoV-NL63
nucleocapsid
protein
.

Biochemical
analyses
revealed
that
the
protein
shares
characteristics
with
homologous
proteins
encoded
in
other
coronaviral
genomes
,
with
the
N-terminal
domain
responsible
for
nucleic
acid
binding
and
the
C-terminal
domain
involved
in
protein
oligomerization
.

Surprisingly
,
analysis
of
the
subcellular
localization
of
the
N
protein
of
HCoV-NL63
revealed
that
,
differently
than
homologous
proteins
from
other
coronaviral
species
except
for
SARS-CoV
,
it
is
not
present
in
the
nucleus
of
infected
or
transfected
cells
.

Furthermore
,
no
significant
alteration
in
cell
cycle
progression
in
cells
expressing
the
protein
was
observed
.

This
is
in
stark
contrast
with
results
obtained
for
other
coronaviruses
,
except
for
the
SARS-CoV
.

Here
we
describe
an
algorithm
for
simulating
epidemics
from
our
proposed
individual
model
.

Consider
the
situation
where
there
is
one
infectious
individual
at
current
time
t
(
i.e
.

the
time
of
this
individual
transits
from
class
E
to
class
I
)
among
an
entirely
susceptible
population
.

The
simulation
proceeds
as
follows
:

Influenza
A
virus
(
IAV
)
enters
cells
by
binding
to
sialic
acid
on
the
cell
surface
.

To
accomplish
this
while
avoiding
immobilization
by
sialic
acid
in
host
mucus
,
viruses
rely
on
a
balance
between
the
receptor-binding
protein
hemagglutinin
(
HA
)
and
the
receptor-cleaving
protein
neuraminidase
(
NA
)
.

Although
genetic
aspects
of
this
balance
are
well-characterized
,
little
is
known
about
how
the
spatial
organization
of
these
proteins
in
the
viral
envelope
may
contribute
.

Using
site-specific
fluorescent
labeling
and
super-resolution
microscopy
,
we
show
that
HA
and
NA
are
asymmetrically
distributed
on
the
surface
of
filamentous
viruses
,
creating
a
spatial
organization
of
binding
and
cleaving
activities
that
causes
viruses
to
step
consistently
away
from
their
NA-rich
pole
.

This
Brownian
ratchet-like
diffusion
produces
persistent
directional
mobility
that
resolves
the
virus
's
conflicting
needs
to
both
penetrate
mucus
and
stably
attach
to
the
underlying
cells
,
potentially
contributing
to
the
prevalence
of
the
filamentous
phenotype
in
clinical
isolates
of
IAV
.

Virions
are
thought
to
contain
all
the
essential
proteins
that
govern
virus
egress
from
the
host
cell
and
initiation
of
replication
in
the
target
cell
.

It
has
been
known
for
some
time
that
influenza
virions
contain
nine
viral
proteins
;
however
,
analyses
of
other
enveloped
viruses
have
revealed
that
proteins
from
the
host
cell
can
also
be
detected
in
virions
.

To
address
whether
the
same
is
true
for
influenza
virus
,
we
used
two
complementary
mass
spectrometry
approaches
to
perform
a
comprehensive
proteomic
analysis
of
purified
influenza
virus
particles
.

In
addition
to
the
aforementioned
nine
virus-encoded
proteins
,
we
detected
the
presence
of
36
host-encoded
proteins
.

These
include
both
cytoplasmic
and
membrane-bound
proteins
that
can
be
grouped
into
several
functional
categories
,
such
as
cytoskeletal
proteins
,
annexins
,
glycolytic
enzymes
,
and
tetraspanins
.

Interestingly
,
a
significant
number
of
these
have
also
been
reported
to
be
present
in
virions
of
other
virus
families
.

Protease
treatment
of
virions
combined
with
immunoblot
analysis
was
used
to
verify
the
presence
of
the
cellular
protein
and
also
to
determine
whether
it
is
located
in
the
core
of
the
influenza
virus
particle
.

Immunogold
labeling
confirmed
the
presence
of
membrane-bound
host
proteins
on
the
influenza
virus
envelope
.

The
identification
of
cellular
constituents
of
influenza
virions
has
important
implications
for
understanding
the
interactions
of
influenza
virus
with
its
host
and
brings
us
a
step
closer
to
defining
the
cellular
requirements
for
influenza
virus
replication
.

While
not
all
of
the
host
proteins
are
necessarily
incorporated
specifically
,
those
that
are
and
are
found
to
have
an
essential
role
represent
novel
targets
for
antiviral
drugs
and
for
attenuation
of
viruses
for
vaccine
purposes
.

The
study
evaluated
the
effect
of
New
Neonatal
Porcine
Diarrhoea
Syndrome
(
NNPDS
)
on
average
daily
gain
(
ADG
)
and
mortality
and
described
the
clinical
manifestations
in
four
herds
suffering
from
the
syndrome
.

NNPDS
is
a
diarrhoeic
syndrome
affecting
piglets
within
the
first
week
of
life
,
which
is
not
caused
by
enterotoxigenic
Escherichia
coli
(
ETEC
)
,
Clostridium
perfringens
(
C.
perfringens
)
type
A/C
,
Clostridium
difficile
(
C.
difficile
)
,
rotavirus
A
,
coronavirus
,
Cystoisospora
suis
,
Strongyloides
ransomi
,
Giardia
spp
or
Cryptosporidium
spp
.

Results
:
Piglets
were
estimated
to
have
a
negative
ADG
of
9
and
14
g
when
diarrhoeic
for
1
day
and
>
1
day
respectively
.

However
,
if
only
diarrhoeic
on
the
day
of
birth
,
no
negative
effect
on
ADG
was
seen
.

Piglets
originating
from
severely
affected
litters
were
estimated
to
have
a
reduced
ADG
of
38
g.
The
study
did
not
show
an
overall
effect
of
diarrhoea
on
mortality
,
but
herd
of
origin
,
sow
parity
,
birth
weight
,
and
gender
were
significantly
associated
with
mortality
.

In
one
of
the
herds
,
approximately
25
%
of
the
diarrhoeic
piglets
vs.
6
%
of
the
non-diarrhoeic
piglets
died
,
and
74
%
of
necropsied
piglets
were
diagnosed
with
enteritis
.

These
findings
indicate
that
the
high
mortality
seen
in
this
herd
was
due
to
diarrhoea
.

Conclusions
:
NNPDS
negatively
affected
ADG
in
piglets
,
and
even
piglets
that
were
diarrhoeic
for
one
day
only
experienced
a
reduction
in
ADG
.

However
,
the
study
showed
that
diarrhoea
restricted
to
the
day
of
birth
did
not
affect
ADG
and
suggested
this
phenomenon
to
be
unrelated
to
the
syndrome
.

Since
the
diarrhoeal
status
of
the
litter
had
important
effects
on
ADG
,
future
research
on
NNPDS
probably
ought
to
focus
on
piglets
from
severely
affected
litters
.

The
study
showed
important
dissimilarities
in
the
course
of
diarrhoea
between
the
herds
,
and
one
herd
was
considerably
more
affected
than
the
others
.

Within
this
herd
,
NNPDS
seemed
to
be
associated
with
a
higher
mortality
,
whereas
in
general
the
study
did
not
show
lethal
effects
of
NNPDS
.

Background
and
purpose
:
Systemic
upregulation
of
inflammatory
cytokines
is
characteristic
of
critical
severe
hand
,
foot
,
and
mouth
disease
(
HFMD
)
with
pulmonary
edema
.

Thus
,
immunomodulatory
medicines
such
as
steroids
,
including
methylprednisolone
,
have
been
proposed
to
treat
patients
with
severe
HFMD
in
China
,
because
it
is
postulated
that
inflammatory
cytokines
play
a
role
in
the
development
of
severe
complications
.

This
study
is
to
further
investigate
the
inflammatory
response
in
the
relatively
mild
HFMD
patients
,
and
whether
steroid
treatment
has
a
beneficial
effect
on
the
suppression
of
inflammation
in
HFMD
patients
.

We
measured
the
levels
of
50
kinds
of
chemokines
,
cytokines
,
growth
factors
and
soluble
receptors
in
serum
samples
from
control
patients
without
HFMD
and
the
HFMD
patients
with
or
without
prior
treatment
of
intravenous
methylprednisolone
.

Results
:
Our
present
study
found
that
even
relatively
mild
HFMD
patients
without
central
nervous
system
(
CNS
)
complications
had
elevated
serum
levels
of
inflammatory
cytokines
,
including
interleukin
(
IL
)
-3
,
IL-6
,
IL-12p40
,
and
tumor
necrosis
factor
(
TNF
)
-a
,
which
suggested
systemic
inflammation
.

In
contrast
,
these
patients
also
have
decreased
levels
of
other
serum
biomarkers
,
including
IL-1Ra
,
IL-8
,
IL-16
,
soluble
ICAM-1
,
CXCL-1
,
and
CCL27
.

The
dysregulation
of
cytokine
and
chemokine
expression
may
be
involved
in
CNS
complications
and
unbalanced
circulating
leukocytes
in
HFMD
patients
.

Surprisingly
,
patients
treated
with
methylprednisolone
had
no
difference
in
the
expression
levels
of
HFMD-associated
biomarkers
instead
had
slightly
increased
levels
of
IL-17A
,
which
was
not
associated
with
the
occurrence
of
HFMD
.

Conclusion
:
Whether
steroid
treatment
has
any
beneficial
effect
on
the
prognosis
of
HFMD
patients
requires
to
be
further
investigated
.

In
herpes
simplex
virus
1
(
HSV-1
)
-infected
cells
,
G4s
are
massively
present
during
viral
replication
.

We
here
aimed
at
investigating
the
possibility
to
target
the
HSV-1
G4s
by
a
core
extended
naphtalene
diimide
(
c-exNDI
)
G4
ligand
.

Biophysical
and
biomolecular
analysis
proved
that
c-exNDI
stabilized
the
HSV-1
G4s
in
a
concentration
dependent
manner
.

In
MS
competition
assays
,
c-exNDI
preferentially
recognized
HSV-1
G4s
over
cellular
telomeric
G4s
,
the
most
represented
G4s
within
cells
;
other
less
abundant
cellular
G4s
were
also
recognized
.

Treatment
of
HSV-1
infected
cells
with
c-exNDI
at
low
nanomolar
concentrations
induced
significant
virus
inhibition
with
no
cytotoxicity
.

The
mechanism
of
action
was
ascribed
to
G4-mediated
inhibition
of
viral
DNA
replication
,
with
consequent
impairment
of
viral
genes
transcription
.

Our
data
suggest
that
the
observed
potent
antiviral
activity
and
low
cytotoxicity
mainly
depend
on
a
combination
of
c-exNDI
affinity
for
HSV-1
G4s
and
their
massive
presence
during
infection
.

HSV-1
G4s
may
thus
represent
new
effective
antiviral
targets
:
the
fact
that
no
current
antiherpetic
drug
exploits
them
and
their
presence
at
the
viral
genome
,
responsible
for
both
active
and
latent
HSV
infections
,
makes
them
particularly
attracting
.

G-quadruplexes
(
G4s
)
are
nucleic
acids
secondary
structures
that
may
form
in
single-stranded
G-rich
sequences
under
physiological
conditions

.

Four
Gs
bind
via
Hoogsteen-type
hydrogen
bonds
base-pairing
to
yield
G-quartets
,
which
stack
to
form
the
G4
.

The
presence
of
K
+
cations
specifically
supports
G4
formation
and
stability
2
.

Based
on
the
strand
orientation
,
G4s
can
adopt
three
main
topologies
:
parallel
,
antiparallel
,
and
hybrid-type
structures
.

In
eukaryotes
,
G4s
have
been
shown
to
be
involved
in
key
regulatory
roles
,
including
transcriptional
regulation
of
gene
promoters
and
enhancers
,
translation
,
chromatin
epigenetic
regulation
,
DNA
recombination

.

Expansion
of
G-quadruplex-forming
motifs
has
been
associated
with
relevant
human
neurological
disorders
4
,
8
,
9
.

Formation
of
G4s
in
vivo
has
been
consolidated
by
the
discovery
of
cellular
proteins
that
specifically
recognize
G4s
10
,
11
and
the
development
of
G4
specific
antibodies
12
,
13
.

Recently
,
the
presence
of
G4s
in
viruses
and
their
involvement
in
virus
key
steps
has
been
provided
14
.

G4s
have
been
implicated
in
pathogenic
mechanisms
of
the
human
immunodeficiency
virus
,
where
functionally
significant
G4s
have
been
identified
5
,
11
,
15-17
and
stabilized
by
G4
ligands
with
consequent
antiviral
effects

We

possesses
several
repeats

The
microbiome
influences
adaptive
immunity
and
molecular
mimicry
influences
T
cell
reactivity
.

Here
,
we
evaluated
whether
the
sequence
similarity
of
various
antigens
to
the
microbiota
dampens
or
increases
immunogenicity
of
T
cell
epitopes
.

Streptococcus
pneumoniae
is
the
main
bacterial
pathogen
involved
in
pneumonia
.

Pneumococcal
acquisition
and
colonization
density
is
probably
affected
by
viral
co-infections
,
the
local
microbiome
composition
and
mucosal
immunity
.

Here
,
we
report
the
interactions
between
live-attenuated
influenza
vaccine
(
LAIV
)
,
successive
pneumococcal
challenge
,
and
the
healthy
adult
nasal
microbiota
and
mucosal
immunity
using
an
experimental
human
challenge
model
.

Nasal
microbiota
profiles
at
baseline
are
associated
with
consecutive
pneumococcal
carriage
outcome
(
non-carrier
,
low-dense
and
high-dense
pneumococcal
carriage
)
,
independent
of
LAIV
co-administration
.

Corynebacterium/Dolosigranulumdominated
profiles
are
associated
with
low-density
colonization
.

Lowest
rates
of
natural
viral
co-infection
at
baseline
and
post-LAIV
influenza
replication
are
detected
in
the
low-density
carriers
.

Also
,
we
detected
the
fewest
microbiota
perturbations
and
mucosal
cytokine
responses
in
the
low-density
carriers
compared
to
non-carriers
or
high-density
carriers
.

These
results
indicate
that
the
complete
respiratory
ecosystem
affects
pneumococcal
behaviour
following
challenge
,
with
low-density
carriage
representing
the
most
stable
ecological
state
.

By
definition
,
zoonotic
pathogens
are
not
strict
host-species
specialists
in
that
they
infect
humans
and
at
least
one
nonhuman
reservoir
species
.

The
majority
of
zoonotic
pathogens
infect
and
are
amplified
by
multiple
vertebrate
species
in
nature
,
each
of
which
has
a
quantitatively
different
impact
on
the
distribution
and
abundance
of
the
pathogen
and
thus
on
disease
risk
.

Unfortunately
,
when
new
zoonotic
pathogens
emerge
,
the
dominant
response
by
public
health
scientists
is
to
search
for
a
few
,
or
even
the
single
,
most
important
reservoirs
and
to
ignore
other
species
that
might
strongly
influence
transmission
.

This
focus
on
the
single
``
primary
''
reservoir
host
species
can
delay
biological
understanding
,
and
potentially
public
health
interventions
as
species
important
in
either
amplifying
or
regulating
the
pathogen
are
overlooked
.

Investigating
the
evolutionary
and
ecological
strategy
of
newly
discovered
or
emerging
pathogens
within
the
community
of
potential
and
actual
host
species
will
be
fruitful
to
both
biological
understanding
and
public
health
.

The
emergence
of
different
viral
infections
during
the
last
decades
like
dengue
,
West
Nile
,
SARS
,
chikungunya
,
MERS-CoV
,
Ebola
,
Zika
and
Yellow
Fever
raised
some
questions
on
quickness
and
reliability
of
laboratory
diagnostic
tests
for
verification
of
suspected
cases
.

Since
sampling
of
blood
requires
medically
trained
personal
and
comprises
some
risks
for
the
patient
as
well
as
for
the
health
care
personal
,
the
sampling
by
noninvasive
methods
(
e.g
.

saliva
and/
or
urine
)
might
be
a
very
valuable
alternative
for
investigating
a
diseased
patient
.

Main
body
:
To
analyse
the
usefulness
of
alternative
noninvasive
samples
for
the
diagnosis
of
emerging
infectious
viral
diseases
,
a
literature
search
was
performed
on
PubMed
for
alternative
sampling
for
these
viral
infections
.

In
total
,
711
papers
of
potential
relevance
were
found
,
of
which
we
have
included
128
in
this
review
.

Conclusions
:
Considering
the
experience
using
non-invasive
sampling
for
the
diagnostic
of
emerging
viral
diseases
,
it
seems
important
to
perform
an
investigation
using
alternative
samples
for
routine
diagnostics
.

Moreover
,
during
an
outbreak
situation
,
evaluation
of
appropriate
sampling
and
further
processing
for
laboratory
analysis
on
various
diagnostic
platforms
are
very
crucial
.

This
will
help
to
achieve
optimal
diagnostic
results
for
a
good
and
reliable
case
identification
.

Although
the
risk
of
transfusion-transmitted
infections
today
is
lower
than
ever
,
the
supply
of
safe
blood
products
remains
subject
to
contamination
with
known
and
yet
to
be
identified
human
pathogens
.

Only
continuous
improvement
and
implementation
of
donor
selection
,
sensitive
screening
tests
and
effective
inactivation
procedures
can
ensure
the
elimination
,
or
at
least
reduction
,
of
the
risk
of
acquiring
transfusion
transmitted
infections
.

In
addition
,
ongoing
education
and
up-to-date
information
regarding
infectious
agents
that
are
potentially
transmitted
via
blood
components
is
necessary
to
promote
the
reporting
of
adverse
events
,
an
important
component
of
transfusion
transmitted
disease
surveillance
.

Thus
,
the
collaboration
of
all
parties
involved
in
transfusion
medicine
,
including
national
haemovigilance
systems
,
is
crucial
for
protecting
a
secure
blood
product
supply
from
known
and
emerging
blood-borne
pathogens
.

Dengue
virus
Type
2
(
DENV-2
)
is
predominant
serotype
causing
major
dengue
epidemics
.

There
are
a
number
of
studies
carried
out
to
find
its
effective
antiviral
,
however
to
date
,
there
is
still
no
molecule
either
from
peptide
or
small
molecules
released
as
a
drug
.

The
present
study
aims
to
identify
small
molecules
inhibitor
from
National
Cancer
Institute
database
through
virtual
screening
.

One
of
the
hits
,
D0713
(
IC
50
=
62
μM
)
bearing
thioguanine
scaffold
was
derivatised
into
21
compounds
and
evaluated
for
DENV-2
NS2B/NS3
protease
inhibitory
activity
.

Compounds
18
and
21
demonstrated
the
most
potent
activity
with
IC
50
of
0.38
μM
and
16
μM
,
respectively
.

Molecular
dynamics
and
MM/PBSA
free
energy
of
binding
calculation
were
conducted
to
study
the
interaction
mechanism
of
these
compounds
with
the
protease
.

The
free
energy
of
binding
of
18
calculated
by
MM/PBSA
is
-16.10
kcal/mol
compared
to
the
known
inhibitor
,
panduratin
A
(
-11.27
kcal/mol
)
,
which
corroborates
well
with
the
experimental
observation
.

Results
from
molecular
dynamics
simulations
also
showed
that
both
18
and
21
bind
in
the
active
site
and
stabilised
by
the
formation
of
hydrogen
bonds
with
Asn174
.

Background
:
The
lack
of
optimal
porcine
cell
lines
has
severely
impeded
the
study
and
progress
in
elucidation
of
porcine
epidemic
diarrhea
virus
(
PEDV
)
pathogenesis
.

Vero
cell
,
an
African
green
monkey
kidney
cell
line
,
was
often
used
to
isolate
and
propagate
PEDV
.

Nonetheless
,
the
target
cells
of
PEDV
in
vivo
are
intestinal
epithelial
cells
,
during
infection
,
intestinal
epithelia
would
be
damaged
and
resulted
in
digestive
disorders
.

The
immune
functions
of
porcine
epithelial
cells
and
interactions
with
other
immune
cell
populations
display
a
number
of
differences
compared
to
other
species
.

Type
I
interferon
(
IFN
)
plays
an
important
role
in
antiviral
immune
response
.

Limited
reports
showed
that
PEDV
could
inhibit
type
I
interferon
production
.

In
this
study
,
porcine
small
intestinal
epithelial
cells
(
IECs
)
,
the
target
cells
of
PEDV
,
were
used
as
the
infection
model
in
vitro
to
identify
the
possible
molecular
mechanisms
of
PEDV-inhibition
IFN-β
production
.

Results
:
PEDV
not
only
failed
to
induce
IFN-β
expression
,
but
also
inhibited
dsRNA-mediated
IFN-β
production
in
IECs
.

As
the
key
IFN-β
transcription
factors
,
we
found
that
dsRNA-induced
activation
of
IFN
regulatory
factor
3
(
IRF-3
)
was
inhibited
after
PEDV
infection
,
but
not
nuclear
factor-kappaB
(
NF-κB
)
.

To
identify
the
mechanism
of
PEDV
intervention
with
dsRNA-mediated
IFN-β
expression
more
accurately
,
the
role
of
individual
molecules
of
RIG-I
signaling
pathway
were
investigated
.

In
the
upstream
of
IRF-3
,
TANK-binding
kinase
1
(
TBK1
)
-or
inhibitor
of
κB
kinase-ε
(
IKKε
)
-mediated
IFN-β
production
was
not
blocked
by
PEDV
,
while
RIG-I-and
its
adapter
molecule
IFN-β
promoter
stimulator
1
(
IPS-1
)
-mediated
IFN-β
production
were
completely
inhibited
after
PEDV
infection
.

Conclusion
:
Taken
together
,
our
data
demonstrated
for
the
first
time
that
PEDV
infection
of
its
target
cell
line
,
IECs
,
inhibited
dsRNA-mediated
IFN-β
production
by
blocking
the
activation
of
IPS-1
in
RIG-I-mediated
pathway
.

Our
studies
offered
new
visions
in
understanding
of
the
interaction
between
PEDV
and
host
innate
immune
system
.

MEDI-565
(
also
known
as
MT111
)
is
a
bispecific
T-cell
engager
(
BiTEH
)
antibody
in
development
for
the
treatment
of
patients
with
cancers
expressing
carcinoembryonic
antigen
(
CEA
)
.

MEDI-565
binds
CEA
on
cancer
cells
and
CD3
on
T
cells
to
induce
T-cell
mediated
killing
of
cancer
cells
.

To
understand
the
molecular
basis
of
human
CEA
recognition
by
MEDI-565
and
how
polymorphisms
and
spliced
forms
of
CEA
may
affect
MEDI-565
activity
,
we
mapped
the
epitope
of
MEDI-565
on
CEA
using
mutagenesis
and
homology
modeling
approaches
.

We
found
that
MEDI-565
recognized
a
conformational
epitope
in
the
A2
domain
comprised
of
amino
acids
326-349
and
388-410
,
with
critical
residues
F
326
,
T

,
N
333
,
V

,
G

,
P
390
,
E
392
,
I
408
,
and
N
410
.

Two
non-synonymous
single-nucleotide
polymorphisms
(
SNPs
)
(
rs10407503
,
rs7249230
)
were
identified
in
the
epitope
region
,
but
they
are
found
at
low
homozygosity
rates
.

Searching
the
National
Center
for
Biotechnology
Information
GenBankH
database
,
we
further
identified
a
single
,
previously
uncharacterized
mRNA
splice
variant
of
CEA
that
lacks
a
portion
of
the
N-terminal
domain
,
the
A1
and
B1
domains
,
and
a
large
portion
of
the
A2
domain
.

Real-time
quantitative
polymerase
chain
reaction
analysis
of
multiple
cancers
showed
widespread
expression
of
full-length
CEA
in
these
tumors
,
with
less
frequent
but
concordant
expression
of
the
CEA
splice
variant
.

Because
the
epitope
was
largely
absent
from
the
CEA
splice
variant
,
MEDI-565
did
not
bind
or
mediate
T-cell
killing
of
cells
solely
expressing
this
form
of
CEA
.

In
addition
,
the
splice
variant
did
not
interfere
with
MEDI-565
binding
or
activity
when
co-expressed
with
full-length
CEA
.

Thus
MEDI-565
may
broadly
target
CEA-positive
tumors
without
regard
for
expression
of
the
short
splice
variant
of
CEA
.

Together
our
data
suggest
that
MEDI-565
activity
will
neither
be
impacted
by
SNPs
nor
by
a
splice
variant
of
CEA
.

The
type
I
interferon
(
IFN
)
signaling
response
limits
infection
of
many
RNA
and
DNA
viruses
.

To
define
key
cell
types
that
require
type
I
IFN
signaling
to
orchestrate
immunity
against
West
Nile
virus
(
WNV
)
,
we
infected
mice
with
conditional
deletions
of
the
type
I
IFN
receptor
(
IFNAR
)
gene
.

Deletion
of
the
Ifnar
gene
in
subsets
of
myeloid
cells
resulted
in
uncontrolled
WNV
replication
,
vasoactive
cytokine
production
,
sepsis
,
organ
damage
,
and
death
that
were
remarkably
similar
to
infection
of
Ifnar
2/2
mice
completely
lacking
type
I
IFN
signaling
.

In
Mavs
2/2
6Ifnar
2/2
myeloid
cells
and
mice
lacking
both
Ifnar
and
the
RIG-I-like
receptor
adaptor
gene
Mavs
,
cytokine
production
was
muted
despite
high
levels
of
WNV
infection
.

Thus
,
in
myeloid

signaling
through

to
induce
proinflammatory
cytokines
that
can
result
in
sepsis
and
organ
damage
.

Viral
pathogenesis
was
caused
in
part
by
massive
complement
activation
,
as
liver
damage
was
minimized
in
animals
lacking
complement
components
C3
or
factor
B
or
treated
with
neutralizing
anti-C5
antibodies
.

Disease
in
Ifnar
2/2
and
CD11c
Cre
+
Ifnar
f/f
mice
also
was
facilitated
by
the
proinflammatory
cytokine
TNF-a
,
as
blocking
antibodies
diminished
complement
activation
and
prolonged
survival
without
altering
viral
burden
.

Collectively
,
our
findings
establish
the
dominant
role
of
type
I
IFN
signaling
in
myeloid
cells
in
restricting
virus
infection
and
controlling
pathological
inflammation
and
tissue
injury
.

Human
cytomegalovirus
(
HCMV
)
is
a
ubiquitous
betaherpesvirus
that
frequently
causes
morbidity
and
mortality
in
individuals
with
insufficient
immunity
,
such
as
transplant
recipients
,
AIDS
patients
,
and
congenitally
infected
newborns
.

Several
antiviral
drugs
are
approved
to
treat
HCMV
infections
.

However
,
resistant
HCMV
mutants
can
arise
in
patients
receiving
long-term
therapy
.

Additionally
,
side
effects
and
the
risk
to
cause
birth
defects
limit
the
use
of
currently
approved
antivirals
against
HCMV
.

Therefore
,
the
identification
of
new
drug
targets
is
of
clinical
relevance
.

Recent
work
identified
DNA-damage
binding
protein
1
(
DDB1
)
and
the
family
of
the
cellular
cullin
(
Cul
)
RING
ubiquitin
(
Ub
)
ligases
(
CRLs
)
as
host-derived
factors
that
are
relevant
for
the
replication
of
human
and
mouse
cytomegaloviruses
.

The
first-in-class
CRL
inhibitory
compound
Pevonedistat
(
also
called
MLN4924
)
is
currently
under
investigation
as
an
anti-tumor
drug
in
several
clinical
trials
.

Cytomegaloviruses
exploit
CRLs
to
regulate
the
abundance
of
viral
proteins
,
and
to
induce
the
proteasomal
degradation
of
host
restriction
factors
involved
in
innate
and
intrinsic
immunity
.

Accordingly
,
pharmacological
blockade
of
CRL
activity
diminishes
viral
replication
in
cell
culture
.

In
this
review
,
we
summarize
the
current
knowledge
concerning
the
relevance
of
DDB1
and
CRLs
during
cytomegalovirus
replication
and
discuss
chances
and
drawbacks
of
CRL
inhibitory
drugs
as
potential
antiviral
treatment
against
HCMV

The
role
of
contaminated
clothing
in
the
transmission
of
influenza
A
virus
during
an
epidemic
period
was
investigated
by
examining
the
recovery
of
infectious
influenza
virus
from
experimentally
virus-contaminated
clothing
,
which
had
been
subejected
to
routine
wearing
and
washing
for
several
months
or
years
.

The
amount
of
infectious
virus
recovered
from
the
nine
types
of
clothing
decreased
with
time
and
was
shown
to
differ
widely
between
clothing
samples
,
when
the
contaminated
clothing
samples
were
maintained
in
uncovered
glass
Petri
dishes
in
a
safety
cabinet
under
air
blowing
.

These
results
indicate
a
dependence
of
virus
transmissibility
on
the
nature
of
the
contaminated
clothes
.

The
difference
in
recovery
was
shown
to
have
no
significant
correlation
with
the
thickness
or
the
materials
of
the
clothing
;
however
,
a
correlation
was
observed
with
the
residual
amount
of
water
in
the
deposited
virus
preparation
on
the
test
clothing
.

RIG-I
is
a
pattern
recognition
receptor
and
recognizes
cytoplasmic
viral
double-stranded
RNA
(
dsRNA
)
.

Influenza
A
virus
,
hepatitis
C
virus
,
and
several
other
pathogenic
viruses
are
mainly
recognized
by
RIG-I
,
resulting
in
the
activation
of
the
innate
immune
responses
.

The
protein
comprises
N-terminal
two
caspase
activation
and
recruitment
domains
(
2CARDs
)
,
an
RNA
helicase
domain
,
and
the
C-terminal
domain
(
CTD
)
.

The
CTD
recognizes
5′-triphosphate
viral
dsRNA
.

After
recognition
of
viral
dsRNA
,
the
protein
harbors
K63-linked
polyubiquitination
essential
for
RIG-I
activation
.

First
,
it
was
reported
that
TRIM25
ubiquitin
ligase
delivered
K63-linked
polyubiquitin
moiety
to
the
2CARDs
.

The
polyubiquitin
chain
stabilizes
a
structure
called
the
2CARD
tetramer
,
in
which
four
2CARDs
assemble
and
make
a
core
that
promotes
the
aggregation
of
the
mitochondrial
antiviral-signaling
(
MAVS
)
protein
on
mitochondria
.

MAVS
aggregation
then
triggers
the
signal
to
induce
the
innate
immune
responses
.

However
,
subsequent
studies
have
reported
that
Riplet
,
MEX3C
,
and
TRIM4
ubiquitin
ligases
are
also
involved
in
K63-linked
polyubiquitination
and
the
activation
of
RIG-I
.

MEX3C
and
TRIM4
mediate
polyubiquitination
of
the
2CARDs
.

By
contrast
,
Riplet
ubiquitinates
the
CTD
.

The
physiological
significance
of
each
ubiquitin
ligases
has
been
shown
by
knockout
and
knockdown
studies
,
but
there
appears
to
be
contradictory
to
evidence
reported
in
the
literature
.

In
this
review
,
we
summarize
recent
findings
related
to
K63-linked
polyubiquitination
and
propose
a
model
that
could
reconcile
current
contradictory
theories
.

We
also
discuss
the
physiological
significance
of
the
ubiquitin
ligases
in
the
immune
system
against
viral
infection
.

Background
:
While
it
is
known
that
acute
respiratory
illness
(
ARI
)
is
caused
by
an
array
of
viruses
,
less
is
known
about
co-detections
and
the
resultant
comparative
symptoms
and
illness
burden
.

This
study
examined
the
co-detections
,
the
distribution
of
viruses
,
symptoms
,
and
illness
burden
associated
with
ARI
between
December
2012
and
March
2013
.

Methods
:
Outpatients
with
ARI
were
assayed
for
presence
of
18
viruses
using
multiplex
reverse
transcriptase
polymerase
chain
reaction
(
MRT-PCR
)
to
simultaneously
detect
multiple
viruses
.

Results
:
Among
935
patients
,
60
%
tested
positive
for
a
single
virus
,
9
%
tested
positive
for
≥1
virus
and
287
(
31
%
)
tested
negative
.

Among
children
(
<
18
years
)
,
the
respective
distributions
were
63
%
,
14
%
,
and
23
%
;
whereas
for
younger
adults
(
18-49
years
)
,
the
distributions
were
58
%
,
8
%
,
and
34
%
and
for
older
adults
(
≥50
years
)
the
distributions
were
61
%
,
5
%
,
and
32
%
(
P
<
0.001
)
.

Co-detections
were
more
common
in
children
than
older
adults
(
P
=
0.01
)
,
and
less
frequent
in
households
without
children
(
P
=
0.003
)
.

Most
frequently
co-detected
viruses
were
coronavirus
,
respiratory
syncytial
virus
,
and
influenza
A
virus
.

Compared
with
single
viral
infections
,
those
with
co-detections
less
frequently
reported
sore
throat
(
P
=
0.01
)
,
missed
fewer
days
of
school
(
1.1
vs.
2
days
;
P
=
0.04
)
,
or
work
(
2
vs.
3
days
;
P
=
0.03
)
;
other
measures
of
illness
severity
did
not
vary
.

Conclusions
:
Among
outpatients
with
ARI
,
69
%
of
visits
were
associated
with
a
viral
etiology
.

Co-detections
of
specific
clusters
of
viruses
were
observed
in
9
%
of
ARI
cases
particularly
in
children
,
were
less
frequent
in
households
without
children
,
and
were
less
symptomatic
(
e.g.
,
lower
fever
)
than
single
infections
.

To
better
understand
dynamic
disease
processes
,
integrated
multi-omic
methods
are
needed
,
yet
comparing
different
types
of
omic
data
remains
difficult
.

Integrative
solutions
benefit
experimenters
by
eliminating
potential
biases
that
come
with
single
omic
analysis
.

We
have
developed
the
methods
needed
to
explore
whether
a
relationship
exists
between
co-expression
network
models
built
from
transcriptomic
and
proteomic
data
types
,
and
whether
this
relationship
can
be
used
to
improve
the
disease
signature
discovery
process
.

A
naïve
,
correlation
based
method
is
utilized
for
comparison
.

Using
publicly
available
infectious
disease
time
series
data
,
we
analyzed
the
related
co-expression
structure
of
the
transcriptome
and
proteome
in
response
to
SARS-CoV
infection
in
mice
.

Transcript
and
peptide
expression
data
was
filtered
using
quality
scores
and
subset
by
taking
the
intersection
on
mapped
Entrez
IDs
.

Using
this
data
set
,
independent
co-expression
networks
were
built
.

The
networks
were
integrated
by
constructing
a
bipartite
module
graph
based
on
module
member
overlap
,
module
summary
correlation
,
and
correlation
to
phenotypes
of
interest
.

Compared
to
the
module
level
results
,
the
naïve
approach
is
hindered
by
a
lack
of
correlation
across
data
types
,
less
significant
enrichment
results
,
and
little
functional
overlap
across
data
types
.

Our
module
graph
approach
avoids
these
problems
,
resulting
in
an
integrated
omic
signature
of
disease
progression
,
which
allows
prioritization
across
data
types
for
down-stream
experiment
planning
.

Integrated
modules
exhibited
related
functional
enrichments
and
could
suggest
novel
interactions
in
response
to
infection
.

These
disease
and
platform-independent
methods
can
be
used
to
realize
the
full
potential
of
multi-omic
network
signatures
.

to
summarize
existing
evidence
of
the
diagnostic
accuracy
of
LUS
for

.

Methods
:
We
conducted
a
systematic
search
of

.

We
assessed
for

.

Results
:
Our
initial

yielded
2726

These
10
studies
provided
a

who
were
either

4
studies
enrolled
critically-ill

.

LUS
was
performed
by
highly-skilled

All
studies
were
conducted
in

settings
.

LUS
took
a
maximum
of
13
minutes
to
conduct
.

Nine
studies
used
a
3.5-5

Conclusions
:
Our
meta-analysis
supports
that
LUS
,

,
performs
well
for

General

the
BE
has
taken
place
and
revealed
common
pathogen
exchange
pathways
and
mechanisms
.

In
this
paper
,
we
synthesize
this
microbiology
of
the
BE
research
and
the
known
information
about
SARS-CoV-2
to
provide
actionable
and
achievable
guidance
to
BE
decision
makers
,
building
operators
,
and
all
indoor
occupants
attempting
to
minimize
infectious
disease
transmission
through
environmentally
mediated
pathways
.

We
believe
this
information
is
useful
to
corporate
and
public
administrators
and
individuals
responsible
for
building
operations
and
environmental
services
in
their
decision-making
process
about
the
degree
and
duration
of
social-distancing
measures
during
viral
epidemics
and
pandemics
.

Bovine
respiratory
disease
(
BRD
)
is
the
leading
cause
of
morbidity
and
mortality
in
feedlot
cattle
,
caused
by
multiple
pathogens
that
become
more
virulent
in
response
to
stress
.

As
clinical
signs
often
go
undetected
and
various
preventive
strategies
failed
,
identification
of
genes
affecting
BRD
is
essential
for
selection
for
resistance
.

Selective
DNA
pooling
(
SDP
)
was
applied
in
a
genome
wide
association
study
(
GWAS
)
to
map
BRD
QTLs
in
Israeli
Holstein
male
calves
.

Kosher
scoring
of
lung
adhesions
was
used
to
allocate
122
and
62
animals
to
High
(
Glatt
Kosher
)
and
Low
(
Non-Kosher
)
resistant
groups
,
respectively
.

Genotyping
was
performed
using
the
Illumina
BovineHD
BeadChip
according
to
the
Infinium
protocol
.

Moving
average
of
-logP
was
used
to
map
QTLs
and
Log
drop
was
used
to
define
their
boundaries
(
QTLRs
)
.

The
combined
procedure
was
efficient
for
high
resolution
mapping
.

Nineteen
QTLRs
distributed
over
13
autosomes
were
found
,
some
overlapping
previous
studies
.

The
QTLRs
contain
polymorphic
functional
and
expression
candidate
genes
to
affect
kosher
status
,
with
putative
immunological
and
wound
healing
activities
.

Kosher
phenotyping
was
shown
to
be
a
reliable
means
to
map
QTLs
affecting
BRD
morbidity
.

Background
:
Rotavirus
(
RV
)
,
is
a
member
of
the
Reoviridae
family
and
an
important
etiological
agent
of
acute
viral
gastroenteritis
in
the
young
.

Rotaviruses
have
a
wide
host
range
infecting
a
broad
range
of
animal
species
,
however
little
is
known
about
rotavirus
infection
in
exotic
animals
.

In
this
paper
we
report
the
first
characterisation
of
a
RV
strain
from
a
giraffe
calf
.

Results
:
This
report
describes
the
identification
and
detailed
molecular
characterisation
of
a
rotavirus
strain
detected
from
a
14-day-old
Giraffe
(
Giraffa
camelopardalis
)
,
presenting
with
acute
diarrhea
.

The
RV
strain
detected
from
the
giraffe
was
characterized
molecularly
as
G10P
[
11
]
.

Detailed
sequence
analysis
of
VP4
and
VP7
revealed
significant
identity
at
the
amino
acid
sequence
level
to
Bovine
RV
(
BoRV
)
.

This
study
demonstrates
the
need
for
continuous
surveillance
of
RV
strains
in
various
animal
populations
,
which
will
facilitate
the
identification
of
rotavirus
hosts
not
previously
reported
.

Furthermore
,
extending
typical
epidemiology
studies
to
a
broader
host
range
will
contribute
to
the
timely
identification
of
new
emerging
strain
types
.

The
immunogenicity
and
the
efficacy
of
a
beta-propiolactone-inactivated
caprine
herpesvirus
1
(
CpHV-1
)
vaccine
adjuvanted
with
MF59
TM
were
tested
in
goats
.

Following
two
subcutaneous
immunizations
,
goats
developed
high
titers
of
CpHV-1-specific
serum
and
vaginal
IgG
and
high
serum
virus
neutralization
(
VN
)
titers
.

Peripheral
blood
mononuclear
cells
(
PBMC
)
stimulated
in
vitro
with
inactivated
CpHV-1
produced
high
levels
of
soluble
IFN-gamma
and
exhibited
high
frequencies
of
IFN-gamma
producing
cells
while
soluble
IL-4
was
undetectable
.

On
the
other
hand
,
control
goats
receiving
the
inactivated
CpHV-1
vaccine
without
adjuvant
produced
only
low
serum
antibody
responses
.

A
vaginal
challenge
with
virulent
CpHV-1
was
performed
in
all
vaccinated
goats
and
in
naïve
goats
to
assess
the
efficacy
of
the
two
vaccines
.

Vaginal
disease
was
not
detected
in
goats
vaccinated
with
inactivated
CpHV-1
plus
MF59
TM
and
these
animals
had
undetectable
levels
of
infectious
challenge
virus
in
their
vaginal
washes
.

Goats
vaccinated
with
inactivated
CpHV-1
in
the
absence
of
adjuvant
exhibited
a
less
severe
disease
when
compared
to
naïve
goats
but
shed
titers
of
challenge
virus
that
were
similar
to
those
of
naïve
goats
.

Detection
and
quantitation
of
latent
CpHV-1
DNA
in
sacral
ganglia
in
challenged
goats
revealed
that
the
inactivated
CpHV-1
plus
MF59
TM
vaccine
was
able
to
significantly
reduce
the
latent
viral
load
when
compared
either
to
the
naïve
goats
or
to
the
goats
vaccinated
with
inactivated
CpHV-1
in
the
absence
of
adjuvant
.

Thus
,
a
vaccine
composed
of
inactivated
CpHV-1
plus
MF59
TM
as
adjuvant
was
strongly
immunogenic
and
induced
effective
immunity
against
vaginal
CpHV-1
infection
in
goats
.

Background
:
Complement
proteins
and
activation
products
have
been
found
associated
with
neuropathology
in
Alzheimer
's
disease
(
AD
)
.

Recently
,
a
C5a
receptor
antagonist
was
shown
to
suppress
neuropathology
in
two
murine
models
of
AD
,
Tg2576
and
3xTg
.

Previously
,
a
genetic
deficiency
of
C1q
in
the
Tg2576
mouse
model
showed
an
accumulation
of
fibrillar
plaques
similar
to
the
complement
sufficient
Tg2576
,
but
reactive
glia
were
significantly
decreased
and
neuronal
integrity
was
improved
suggesting
detrimental
consequences
for
complement
activation
in
AD
.

The
goal
of
this
study
was
to
define
the
role
of
the
classical
complement
activation
pathway
in
the
progression
of
pathology
in
the
3xTg
mouse
that
develops
tangles
in
addition
to
fibrillar
plaques
(
more
closely
reflecting
human
AD
pathology
)
and
to
assess
the
influence
of
complement
in
a
model
of
AD
with
a
higher
level
of
complement
hemolytic
activity
.

Methods
:
3xTg
mice
deficient
in
C1q
(
3xTgQ-/-
)
were
generated
,
and
both
3xTg
and
3xTgQ-/-were
backcrossed
to
the
BUB
mouse
strain
which
has
higher
in
vitro
hemolytic
complement
activity
.

Mice
were
aged
and
perfused
,
and
brain
sections
stained
for
pathological
markers
or
analyzed
for
proinflammatory
marker
expression
.

Results
:
3xTgQ-/-mice
showed
similar
amounts
of
fibrillar
amyloid
,
reactive
glia
and
hyperphosphorylated
tau
as
the
C1q-sufficient
3xTg
at
the
ages
analyzed
.

However
,
3xTg
and
3xTgQ-/-on
the
BUB
background
developed
pathology
earlier
than
on
the
original
3xTg
background
,
although
the
presence
of
C1q
had
no
effect
on
neuropathological
and
pro-inflammatory
markers
.

In
contrast
to
that
seen
in
other
transgenic
models
of
AD
,
C1q
,
C4
and
C3
immunoreactivity
was
undetectable
on
the
plaques
of
3xTg
in
any
background
,
although
C3
was
associated
with
reactive
astrocytes
surrounding
the
plaques
.

Importantly
,
properdin
a
component
of
the
alternative
complement
pathway
was
associated
with
plaques
in
all
models
.

Conclusions
:
In
contrast
to
previously
investigated
transgenic
models
of
AD
,
development
of
neuropathology
in
3xTg
mice
,
which
progresses
much
slower
than
other
murine
models
,
may
not
be
influenced
by
fibrillar
amyloid
mediated
activation
of
the
classical
complement
pathway
,
suggesting
that
the
alternative
complement
pathway
activation
or
a
C3-independent
cleavage
of
C5
could
account
for
the
detrimental
effects
in
these
mice
that
are
prevented
by
the
C5a
receptor
antagonist
.

Furthermore
,
the
paucity
of
complement
activation
may
be
a
factor
in
the
slower
kinetics
of
progression
of
pathology
in
the
3xTg
model
of
this
disease
.

In
spite
of
significant
advancements
and
success
in
antiretroviral
therapies
directed
against
HIV
infection
,
there
is
no
cure
for
HIV
,
which
scan
persist
in
a
human
body
in
its
latent
form
and
become
reactivated
under
favorable
conditions
.

Therefore
,
novel
antiretroviral
drugs
with
different
modes
of
actions
are
still
a
major
focus
for
researchers
.

In
particular
,
novel
lead
structures
are
being
sought
from
natural
sources
.

So
far
,
a
number
of
compounds
from
marine
organisms
have
been
identified
as
promising
therapeutics
for
HIV
infection
.

Therefore
,
in
this
paper
,
we
provide
an
overview
of
marine
natural
products
that
were
first
identified
in
the
period
between
2013
and
2018
that
could
be
potentially
used
,
or
further
optimized
,
as
novel
antiretroviral
agents
.

This
pipeline
includes
the
systematization
of
antiretroviral
activities
for
several
categories
of
marine
structures
including
chitosan
and
its
derivatives
,
sulfated
polysaccharides
,
lectins
,
bromotyrosine
derivatives
,
peptides
,
alkaloids
,
diterpenes
,
phlorotannins
,
and
xanthones
as
well
as
adjuvants
to
the
HAART
therapy
such
as
fish
oil
.

We
critically
discuss
the
structures
and
activities
of
the
most
promising
new
marine
anti-HIV
compounds
.

SM934
is
an
artemisinin
analogue
with
immunosuppressive
properties
and
potent
therapeutic
activity
against
lupus-like
diseases
in
autoimmune
mice
.

In
this
report
,
the
therapeutic
efficacy
and
underlying
mechanisms
of
SM934
on
rheumatoid
arthritis
(
RA
)
was
investigated
using
collagen-induced
arthritis
(
CIA
)
in
DBA/1J
mice
.

We
demonstrated
that
SM934
treatment
alleviate
the
severity
of
arthritis
in
CIA
mice
with
established
manifestations
.

The
therapeutic
benefits
were
associated
with
ameliorated
joint
swelling
and
reduced
extent
of
bone
erosion
and
destruction
.

Bcl-6
.

Moreover
,
SM934
decreased
the
IL-21producing
CD4
+
T
cells
and
dampened
the
IL-21
downstream
signaling
through
STAT3
.

These
finding
offered
the
convincing
evidence
that
artemisinin
derivative
might
attenuate
RA
by
simultaneously
interfering
with
the
generation
of
Tfh
cells
and
Th17
cells
as
well
as
the
subsequent
antibody-mediated
immune
responses
.

Our
experiments
suggest
that
GA
inhibits
virion
entry
by
blocking
the
initial
fusion
event
.

Data
showing
inhibition
of
HSV-1
and
CMV
replication
,
when
GA
is
administered
post-infection
,
suggest
a
possible
secondary
mechanism
targeting
protein
and
DNA
synthesis
.

Thus
,
in
light
of
the
strong
effect
of
GA
on
viral
infection
,
even
after
the
infection
begins
,
it
may
potentially
be
used
to
treat
acute
infections
(
e.g
.

Coronavirus
,
EBOV
,
ZIKV
,
IAV
and
measles
)
,
and
also
topically
for
the
successful
treatment
of
active
lesions
(
e.g
.

HSV-1
,
HSV-2
and
varicella-zoster
virus
(
VZV
)
)
.

Ginkgolic
acids
are
alkylphenol
constituents
of
the
leaves
and
fruits
of
Ginkgo
biloba
.

Ginkgo
biloba
extracts
(
GBE
)
have
been
used
as
herbal
supplements
since
at
least
the
16
th
century
and
remain
widely
in
use
1
.

Major
constituents
of
GBE
include
terpine
trilactones
(
ginkgolide
A
,
B
,
C
,
J
,
and
bilobalide
)
,
flavonoid
glycosides
(
quercetin
and
rutin
)
,
as
well
as
Ginkgolic
acids
2
.

Ginkgolic
acids
are
a
mixture
of
several
2-hydroxy-6-alkylbenzoic
acids
in
which
the
most
common
alkyl
chains
contain
13
,
15
,
or
17
carbons
.

The
15
and
17
carbon
chains
are
unsaturated
at
positions
8
and
10
,
respectively
.

The
3
Ginkgolic
acid
(
GA
)
structures
are
,
therefore
,
designated
C13:0
,
C15:1
,
and
C17:1
(
Table

.

GA
has
shown
pleiotropic
effects
in
vitro
,
including
:
antitumor
effects
through
inhibition
of
lipogenesis
;
decreased
expression
of
invasion
associated
proteins
through
AMPK
activation
;
potential
rescue
of
amyloid-β
(
Aβ
)
induced
synaptic
impairment
;
and
inhibition
of
HIV
protease
activity
as
well
as
HIV
viral
replication
4-7
.

GA
was
also
reported
to
have
activity
against
Escherichia
coli
and
Staphylococcus
aureus
8
.

Several
ways
in
which
GA
works
have
been
suggested
including
by
SUMOylation
inhibition
activity
;
blocking
formation
of
the
E1-SUMO
intermediate
9
;
inhibition
of
fatty
acid
synthase
10
;
non-specific
SIRT
inhibition
11
;
and
activation
of
protein
phosphatase
type-2C
12
.

Here
we
report
that
GA
shows
antiviral
activity
against
Herpes
simplex
virus
1
(
HSV-1
)
,
Human
cytomegalovirus
(
HCMV
)
,
and
Zika
virus
(
ZIKV
)
primarily
through
viral
fusion
inhibition
.

In
addition
,
we
show
inhibition
of
entry
of
a
replication-defective
non-enveloped
adenovirus
.

The
antiviral
effects
were
observed
below
the
cytotoxic
threshold
.

We
believe
that
broad
spectrum
antiviral
activity
is
achieved
through
the
inhibition
of
viral
entry
and
that
this
effect
could
be
therapeutically
utilized
systemically
in
the
context
of
severe
acute
viral
disease
,

The
interferon-inducible
transmembrane
(
IFITM
)
protein
family
represents
a
new
class
of
cellular
restriction
factors
that
block
early
stages
of
viral
replication
;
the
underlying
mechanism
is
currently
not
known
.

Here
we
provide
evidence
that
IFITM
proteins
restrict
membrane
fusion
induced
by
representatives
of
all
three
classes
of
viral
membrane
fusion
proteins
.

IFITM1
profoundly
suppressed
syncytia
formation
and
cell-cell
fusion
induced
by
almost
all
viral
fusion
proteins
examined
;
IFITM2
and
IFITM3
also
strongly
inhibited
their
fusion
,
with
efficiency
somewhat
dependent
on
cell
types
.

Furthermore
,
treatment
of
cells
with
IFN
also
markedly
inhibited
viral
membrane
fusion
and
entry
.

By
using
the
Jaagsiekte
sheep
retrovirus
envelope
and
influenza
A
virus
hemagglutinin
as
models
for
study
,
we
showed
that
IFITM-mediated
restriction
on
membrane
fusion
is
not
at
the
steps
of
receptor-and/or
low
pH-mediated
triggering
;
instead
,
the
creation
of
hemifusion
was
essentially
blocked
by
IFITMs
.

Chlorpromazine
(
CPZ
)
,
a
chemical
known
to
promote
the
transition
from
hemifusion
to
full
fusion
,
was
unable
to
rescue
the
IFITM-mediated
restriction
on
fusion
.

In
contrast
,
oleic
acid
(
OA
)
,
a
lipid
analog
that
generates
negative
spontaneous
curvature
and
thereby
promotes
hemifusion
,
virtually
overcame
the
restriction
.

To
explore
the
possible
effect
of
IFITM
proteins
on
membrane
molecular
order
and
fluidity
,
we
performed
fluorescence
labeling
with
Laurdan
,
in
conjunction
with
two-photon
laser
scanning
and
fluorescence-lifetime
imaging
microscopy
(
FLIM
)
.

We
observed
that
the
generalized
polarizations
(
GPs
)
and
fluorescence
lifetimes
of
cell
membranes
expressing
IFITM
proteins
were
greatly
enhanced
,
indicating
higher
molecularly
ordered
and
less
fluidized
membranes
.

Collectively
,
our
data
demonstrated
that
IFITM
proteins
suppress
viral
membrane
fusion
before
the
creation
of
hemifusion
,
and
suggested
that
they
may
do
so
by
reducing
membrane
fluidity
and
conferring
a
positive
spontaneous
curvature
in
the
outer
leaflets
of
cell
membranes
.

Our
study
provides
novel
insight
into
the
understanding
of
how
IFITM
protein
family
restricts
viral
membrane
fusion
and
infection
.

Background
:
Studies
of
wild
animals
responding
to
their
native
parasites
are
essential
if
we
are
to
understand
how
the
immune
system
functions
in
the
natural
environment
.

While
immune
defence
may
bring
increased
survival
,
this
may
come
at
a
resource
cost
to
other
physiological
traits
,
including
reproduction
.

Here
,
we
tested
the
hypothesis
that
wild
common
shrews
(
Sorex
araneus
)
,
which
produce
large
numbers
of
offspring
during
the
one
breeding
season
of
their
short
life
span
,
forgo
investment
in
immunity
and
immune
system
maintenance
,
as
increased
longevity
is
unlikely
to
bring
further
opportunities
for
mating
.

In
particular
,
we
predicted
that
adult
shrews
,
with
shorter
expected
lifespans
,
would
not
respond
as
effectively
as
young
animals
to
infection
.

Methodology/Principal
Findings
:
We
examined
haemolymphatic
tissues
from
wild-caught
common
shrews
using
light
and
transmission
electron
microscopy
,
applied
in
conjunction
with
immunohistology
.

We
compared
composition
and
function
of
these
tissues
in
shrews
of
different
ages
,
and
the
extent
and
type
of
inflammatory
reactions
observed
in
response
to
natural
parasitic
infections
.

All
ages
seemed
able
to
mount
systemic
,
specific
immune
responses
,
but
adult
shrews
showed
some
signs
of
lymphatic
tissue
exhaustion
:
lymphatic
follicles
in
adults
(
n
=
21
)
were
both
smaller
than
those
in
sub-adults
(
n
=
18
;
Wald
=
11.1
,
p,0.05
)
and
exhibited
greater
levels
of
depletion
(
Wald
=
13.3
,
p,0.05
)
.

Conclusions/Significance
:
Contrary
to
our
expectations
,
shrews
respond
effectively
to
their
natural
parasites
,
and
show
little
indication
of
immunosenescence
as
adults
.

The
pancreas
of
Aselli
,
a
unique
lymphoid
organ
,
may
aid
in
providing
efficient
immune
responses
through
the
storage
of
large
numbers
of
plasma
cells
.

This
may
allow
older
animals
to
react
effectively
to
previously
encountered
parasites
,
but
infection
by
novel
agents
,
and
eventual
depletion
of
plasma
cell
reserves
,
could
both
still
be
factors
in
the
near-synchronous
mortality
of
adult
shrews
observed
shortly
after
breeding
.

Synthesis
of
interferon-b
(
IFN-b
)
is
an
innate
response
to
cytoplasmic
infection
with
bacterial
pathogens
.

Our
recent
studies
showed
that
Listeria
monocytogenes
limits
immune
detection
and
IFN-b
synthesis
via
deacetylation
of
its
peptidoglycan
,
which
renders
the
bacterium
resistant
to
lysozyme
degradation
.

Here
,
we
examined
signaling
requirements
for
the
massive
IFN-b
production
resulting
from
the
infection
of
murine
macrophages
with
a
mutant
strain
of
L.
monocytogenes
,
DpgdA
,
which
is
unable
to
modify
its
peptidoglycan
.

We
report
the
identification
of
unconventional
signaling
pathways
to
the
IFN-b
gene
,
requiring
TLR2
and
bacterial
internalization
.

Induction
of
IFN-b
was
independent
of
the
Mal/TIRAP
adaptor
protein
but
required
TRIF
and
the
transcription
factors
IRF3
and
IRF7
.

These
pathways
were
stimulated
to
a
lesser
degree
by
wild-type
L.
monocytogenes
.

They
operated
in
both
resident
and
inflammatory
macrophages
derived
from
the
peritoneal
cavity
,
but
not
in
bone
marrow-derived
macrophages
.

The
novelty
of
our
findings
thus
lies
in
the
first
description
of
TLR2
and
TRIF
as
two
critical
components
leading
to
the
induction
of
the
IFN-b
gene
and
in
uncovering
that
individual
macrophage
populations
adopt
different
strategies
to
link
pathogen
recognition
signals
to
IFN-b
gene
expression
.

All

(

Virus
transmission

easily
in
large
dog
populations
leading
to
high
mortality
rates
particularly
in
unvaccinated
susceptible
animals
.

In
addition
,
these
animals
can
act
as
disease
reservoirs
for
wild
animal
populations
by
occasional
contact
.

Identification
of
susceptible
wildlife
of
Maio
Island
is
of
upmost
importance
to
evaluate
the
risk
of
pathogen
spill
over
from
domestic
to
wild

in
Cape

Replication-competent
controlled
virus
vectors
were
derived
from
the
virulent
herpes
simplex
virus
1
(
HSV-1
)
wild-type
strain
17synϩ
by
placing
one
or
two
replication-essential
genes
under
the
stringent
control
of
a
gene
switch
that
is
coactivated
by
heat
and
an
antiprogestin
.

Upon
activation
of
the
gene
switch
,
the
vectors
replicate
in
infected
cells
with
an
efficacy
that
approaches
that
of
the
wildtype
virus
from
which
they
were
derived
.

Essentially
no
replication
occurs
in
the
absence
of
activation
.

When
administered
to
mice
,
localized
application
of
a
transient
heat
treatment
in
the
presence
of
systemic
antiprogestin
results
in
efficient
but
limited
virus
replication
at
the
site
of
administration
.

The
immunogenicity
of
these
viral
vectors
was
tested
in
a
mouse
footpad
lethal
challenge
model
.

Unactivated
viral
vectors-which
may
be
regarded
as
equivalents
of
inactivated
vaccines-induced
detectable
protection
against
lethality
caused
by
wild-type
virus
challenge
.

Single
activation
of
the
viral
vectors
at
the
site
of
administration
(
rear
footpads
)
greatly
enhanced
protective
immune
responses
,
and
a
second
immunization
resulted
in
complete
protection
.

Once
activated
,
vectors
also
induced
far
better
neutralizing
antibody
and
HSV-1-specific
cellular
immune
responses
than
unactivated
vectors
.

To
find
out
whether
the
immunogenicity
of
a
heterologous
antigen
was
also
enhanced
in
the
context
of
efficient
transient
vector
replication
,
a
virus
vector
constitutively
expressing
an
equine
influenza
virus
hemagglutinin
was
constructed
.

Immunization
of
mice
with

,
as
well
as
a
hemagglutinin-specific
cellular
immune
response
.

Single
activation
of
viral
replication
resulted
in
a
severalfold
enhancement
of
these
immune
responses
.

Recent
molecular
diagnostic
methods
have
significantly
improved
the

of
viral

in
intensive

)
.

It
has
been
observed
that
222G/N
changes
in
the
HA
gene
of
H1N1pdm09
are
associated
with
increased

and
worse
clinical
outcome
.

In
the
present
study
,
the
frequency
of
respiratory

was
assessed
in
respiratory

from
88
patients
admitted
to
16
ICUs
during
the
2014-2015

in
Lombardy
.

Sixty-nine
out
of
88
(
78.4
%
)
patients
were
positive
for
a
respiratory
viral
infection
at
admission
.

Of
these
,
57/69
(
82.6

were
positive
for

,
showed
the
clear

of
subgroup

.

The

in

was
higher

that
observed
in

(

)
(
p
<

)
.

Overall
,
a
greater
number
of
H1N1pdm09
virus
variants
were
observed
using
next
generation
sequencing
on
partial
HA
sequences
(
codons
180-286
)
in
clinical
samples
from
the
LRT
as
compared
to
URT
.

In
addition
,
222G/N/A
mutations
were
observed
in
30
%
of
LRT
samples
from
ICU
patients
.

Finally
,
intra-host

analysis
showed
the

of
viral

in

of
patients
hospitalized

In
the

An
imbalance
in
the
protease
:
Antiprotease
ratio
in
the
COPD
lung
remains
an
important
aspect
of
COPD
pathophysiology
and
several
studies
have
shown
the
efficacy
of
antiprotease
therapy
in
both
in
vitro
and
in
vivo
COPD
models

However
more
in-depth
studies
will
be
required
to
validate
the
efficacy
of
lead
drug
molecules
targeting
these
proteases

This
review
discusses
the
current
status
of
protease-directed
drugs

explores
the
future
prospects
of
utilizing
the
potential
of
antiprotease-based
therapeutics
as
a
treatment
for
this

viral
pathogens

also
play
a
major
role

Given
the
increasing
healthcare

all
of

we
will
focus
on
the

The
protease

Antiprotease

considered
to
be
one
of
the
core
physiological
mechanisms
involved
in
the
pathogenesis
of
COPD

One
of
the
major
genetic
causes
of
COPD
is
A1AT
deficiency
[
32

.

A1AT
is
a
serine
protease
inhibitor

regulates
the
neutrophilic
chemotaxis
involving
both
CXCR1
and
FcγRIIIb
signaling
[

.

In
addition
,
A1AT
has
also

the
levels
of
cathepsin
B

A1AT
deficient
patients

types
of
proteases

The
spread
of
pathogens
in
swine
populations
is
in
part
determined
by
movements
of
animals
between
farms
.

However
,
understanding
additional
characteristics
that
predict
disease
outbreaks
and
uncovering
landscape
factors
related
to
between-farm
spread
are
crucial
steps
toward
risk
mitigation
.

This
study
integrates
animal
movements
with
environmental
risk
factors
to
identify
the
occurrence
of
porcine
epidemic
diarrhea
virus
(
PEDV
)
outbreaks
.

Using
weekly
farm-level
incidence
data
from
332
sow
farms
,
we
applied
machine-learning
algorithms
to
quantify
associations
between
risk
factors
and
PEDV
outbreaks
with
the
ultimate
goal
of
training
predictive
models
and
to
identify
the
most
important
factors
associated
with
PEDV
occurrence
.

Our
best
algorithm
was
able
to
correctly
predict
whether
an
outbreak
occurred
during
one-week
periods
with
>
80
%
accuracy
.

The
most
important
predictors
included
pig
movements
into
neighboring
farms
.

Other
important
neighborhood
attributes
included
hog
density
,
environmental
and
weather
factors
such
as
vegetation
,
wind
speed
,
temperature
,
and
precipitation
,
and
topographical
features
such
as
slope
.

Our
neighborhood-based
approach
allowed
us
to
simultaneously
capture
disease
risks
associated
with
long-distance
animal
movement
as
well
as
local
spatial
dynamics
.

The
model
presented
here
forms
the
foundation
for
near
real-time
disease
mapping
and
will
advance
disease
surveillance
and
control
for
endemic
swine
pathogens
in
the
United
States
.

The
circulation
of
endemic
and
epidemic
viruses
in
livestock
populations
at
farm
,
regional
,
and
national
levels
has
significant
impact
on
animal
welfare
and
livestock
production
within
the
United
States
and
globally
1
.

Numerous
mechanisms
play
an
apparent
role
in
the
spread
of
viruses
between
farms
,
including
the
movement
of
infectious
animals
,
airborne
spread
of
aerosols
,
wildlife
,
and
contaminated
fomites
(
i.e.
,
trucks
,
equipment
,
boots
)
,
feed
and
personnel
2-5
.

However
,
the
relative
importance
of
those
drivers
for
between-farm
transmission
remains
poorly
understood
.

Movement
of
animals
into
a
farm
,
for
example
,
clearly
increases
the
probability
of
disease
introduction
6
,
and
understanding
the
network
of
livestock
movements
and
analyzing
the
routes
,
volumes
,
frequency
,
and
risks
associated
with
animal
movement
is
a
prerequisite
effective
preventive
,
control
,
and
disease
surveillance
measures
in
livestock
6-8
.

At
the
same
time
,
local
spread
of
viruses
between
neighboring
farms
in
close
spatial
proximity
has
been
repeatedly
demonstrated
,
perhaps
mediated
by
windborne
or
fomite-related
mechanisms
9,10
.

A
farm
's
risk
of
infection
may
thus
be
impacted
not
just
by
its
own
animal
movements
,
but
also
by
movements
made
by
neighbors
.

These
local
spatial
dynamics
are
rarely
accounted
for
in
network-based
assessments
of
risks
associated
with
livestock
movement
,
although
such
dynamics
are
an
emergent
property
of
epidemiological
models
simulating
disease
spread
in
spatial
networks
11
,
12
.

Much
of
our
understanding
of
between-farm
pathogen
transmission
in
the
United
States
swine
industry
is
based
on
outbreak
investigations
,
case-control
studies
,
cohorts
and
case
reports
involving
a
relatively
small
number
of
farms
[
13
]
[
14
]
[
15
]
.

Large-scale
datasets
in
which
to
investigate
the
interacting
roles
of
animal
movements
versus
local
transmission
in
between-farm
spread
are
largely
lacking
.

This
is
especially
true
for
endemic
diseases
,
where
farm-level
occurrences
are
often
not
tracked
,
and

Background
:
Bats
are
amongst
the
natural
reservoirs
of
many
coronaviruses
(
CoVs
)
of
which
some
can
lead
to
severe
infection
in
human
.

African
bats
are
known
to
harbor
a
range
of
pathogens
(
e.g.
,
Ebola
and
Marburg
viruses
)
that
can
infect
humans
and
cause
disease
outbreaks
.

A
recent
study
in
South
Africa
isolated
a
genetic
variant
closely
related
to
MERS-CoV
from
an
insectivorous
bat
.

Though
Madagascar
is
home
to
44
bat
species
(
41
insectivorous
and
3
frugivorous
)
of
which
34
are
endemic
,
no
data
exists
concerning
the
circulation
of
CoVs
in
the
island
's
chiropteran
fauna
.

Certain
Malagasy
bats
can
be
frequently
found
in
close
contact
with
humans
and
frugivorous
bats
feed
in
the
same
trees
where
people
collect
and
consume
fruits
and
are
hunted
and
consumed
as
bush
meat
.

The
purpose
of
our
study
is
to
detect
and
identify
CoVs
from
frugivorous
bats
in
Madagascar
to
evaluate
the
risk
of
human
infection
from
infected
bats
.

Methods
:
Frugivorous
bats
belonging
to
three
species
were
captured
in
four
different
regions
of
Madagascar
.

We
analyzed
fecal
and
throat
swabs
to
detect
the
presence
of
virus
through
amplification
of
the
RNA-dependent
RNA
polymerase
(
RdRp
)
gene
,
which
is
highly
conserved
in
all
known
coronaviruses
.

Phylogenetic
analyses
were
performed
from
positive
specimens
.

Results
:
From
351
frugivorous
bats
,
we
detected
14
coronaviruses
from
two
endemic
bats
species
,
of
which
13
viruses
were
identified
from
Pteropus
rufus
and
one
from
Eidolon
dupreanum
,
giving
an
overall
prevalence
of
4.5
%
.

Phylogenetic
analysis
revealed
that
the
Malagasy
strains
belong
to
the
genus
Betacoronavirus
but
form
three
distinct
clusters
,
which
seem
to
represent
previously
undescribed
genetic
lineages
.

Conclusions
:
Our
findings
suggest
that
CoVs
circulate
in
frugivorous
bats
of
Madagascar
,
demonstrating
the
needs
to
evaluate
spillover
risk
to
human
populations
especially
for
individuals
that
hunt
and
consume
infected
bats
.

Possible
dispersal
mechanisms
as
to
how
coronaviruses
arrived
on
Madagascar
are
discussed
.

Objectives
:
In
this
study
,
we
investigated
the
antimicrobial
activity
of
resveratrol
in
combination
with
colistin
,
a
last-resort
agent
for
the
treatment
of
severe
infections
caused
by
multidrug
resistant
Gram-negative
pathogens
.

The
synergistic
activity
and
the
bactericidal
activity
of
colistin
in
combination
with
resveratrol
was
investigated
by
checkerboard
assays
and
time-kill
assays
,
respectively
.

A
total
of
21
strains
were
investigated
,
including
16
strains
of
different
species
(
Klebsiella
pneumoniae
,
n
=
6
,
Escherichia
coli
,
n

Stenotrophomonas
malthophilia

Enterobacter
cloaceae
,
n
=
1
;
Acinetobacter
baumannii
,
n
=
1
)
with
acquired
colistin
resistance
,
three
colistin-susceptible
K.
pneumoniae
precursors
,
and
two
strains
of
intrinsically
colistin-resistant
species
(
Serratia
marcescens
,
n
=
1
;
Proteus
mirabilis
,
n
=
1
)
.

Mechanisms
of
acquired
colistin
resistance
included
chromosomal
mutations
(
i.e.
,
mgrB
,
pmrAB
)
and
plasmid
genes
(
mcr-1
,
mcr-1.2
)
.

Results
:
Resveratrol
did
not
show
any
significant
intrinsic
antimicrobial
activity
.

Overall
,
a
relevant
synergistic
antimicrobial
activity
of
resveratrol
in
combination
with
colistin
was
observed
with
all
tested
strains
,
except
for
the
three
colistin-susceptible
K.
pneumoniae
strains
,
and
for
two
mcr-1-positive
E.
coli
strains
.

In
time-kill
assays
,
performed
with
15
selected
strains
,
the
combination
of
colistin
2
mg/L
plus
resveratrol
128
mg/L
was
bactericidal
with
11
strains
,
and
bacteriostatic
for
the
remaining
ones
.

Conclusions
:
Resveratrol
was
found
to
potentiate
colistin
activity
against
a
wide
panel
of
colistin-resistant
strains
,
regardless
of
species
and
resistance
mechanisms
,
which
would
deserve
further
investigation
for
potential
clinical
applications
.

During
the
latest
outbreak
of
Ebola
virus
disease
in
West
Africa
,
monoclonal
antibody
therapy
(
e.g.
,
ZMapp
)
was
utilized
to
treat
patients
.

However
,
due
to
the
antigenic
differences
among
the
five
ebolavirus
species
,
the
current
therapeutic
monoclonal
antibodies
are
only
effective
against
viruses
of
the
species
Zaire
ebolavirus
.

Although
this
particular
species
has
indeed
caused
the
majority
of
human
infections
in
Central
and
,
recently
,
West
Africa
,
other
ebolavirus
species
(
e.g.
,
Sudan
ebolavirus
and
Bundibugyo
ebolavirus
)
have
also
repeatedly
caused
outbreaks
in
Central
Africa
and
thus
should
not
be
neglected
in
the
development
of
countermeasures
against
ebolaviruses
.

Here
we
report
the
generation
of
an
ebolavirus
glycoprotein-specific
monoclonal
antibody
that
effectively
inhibits
cellular
entry
of
representative
isolates
of
all
known
ebolavirus
species
in
vitro
and
show
its
protective
efficacy
in
mouse
models
of
ebolavirus
infections
.

This
novel
neutralizing
monoclonal
antibody
targets
a
highly
conserved
internal
fusion
loop
in
the
glycoprotein
molecule
and
prevents
membrane
fusion
of
the
viral
envelope
with
cellular
membranes
.

The
discovery
of
this
highly
cross-neutralizing
antibody
provides
a
promising
option
for
broad-acting
ebolavirus
antibody
therapy
and
will
accelerate
the
design
of
improved
vaccines
that
can
selectively
elicit
cross-neutralizing
antibodies
against
multiple
species
of
ebolaviruses
.

As
proven
by
the
latest
epidemic
of
Ebola
virus
disease
(
EVD
)
in
West
Africa
,
ebolaviruses
pose
a
significant
public
health
concern
.

However
,
no
effective
prophylaxis
or
treatment
for
EVD
is
as
yet
commercially
available
.

Five
distinct
species
are
known
in
the
genus
Ebolavirus
,
Zaire
ebolavirus
,
Sudan
ebolavirus
,
Taï
forest
ebolavirus
,
Bundibugyo
ebolavirus
,
and
Reston
ebolavirus
,
represented
by
Ebola
virus
(
EBOV
)
,
Sudan
virus
(
SUDV
)
,
Taï
forest
virus
(
TAFV
)
,
Bundibugyo
virus
(
BDBV
)
,
and
Reston
virus
(
RESTV
)
,
respectively
3
.

Of
these
,
EBOV
,
SUDV
,
and
BDBV
have
caused
EVD
outbreaks
with
increased
frequency
in
Central
and
West
Africa
in
the
last
decade
1,2,4
.

Ebolaviruses
express
a
single
transmembrane
glycoprotein
(
GP
)
that
is
responsible
for
both
receptor
binding
and
membrane
fusion
,
and
thus
the
only
known
target
of
neutralizing
antibodies
.

GP
undergoes
proteolytic
cleavage
by
host
proteases
such
as
furin
,
resulting
in
the
two
subunits
,
GP1
and
GP2
,
which
are
linked
by
a
disulfide
bond
5,6
.

The
GP1
subunit
(
amino
acids
33-501
)
contains
the
core
of
the
glycoprotein
,
receptor
binding
domain
(
RBD
)
,
a
glycan
cap
,
and
a
large
mucin-like
domain
which
extends
around
the
RBD
7
.

The
GP2
(
amino
acids
502-676
)
subunit
contains
the
internal
fusion
loop
(
IFL
)
,
heptad
repeats
1
and
2
(
HR1
and
HR2
)
,
the
transmembrane
region
(
TM
)
,
and
the
cytoplasmic
tail
(
CT
)
8
.

During
the
transport
of
ebolavirus
particles
to
late
endosomes
,
low
pH
leads
to
proteolytic
processing
of
GPs
by
host
cysteine
proteases
such
as
cathepsins
9
,
and
the
exposed
receptor
binding
site
of
the
proteolytically
digested
GP
is
thought
to
interact
with
a
host
receptor
,
Niemann
Pick
C1
,
followed
by
membrane
fusion
8
,
10
,
11
.

Several
studies
have
demonstrated
that
administration
of
EBOV
GP-specific
antibodies
protects
nonhuman
primates
from
lethal
EBOV
infection
and
may
constitute
a
leading
treatment
option
for
EVD
in
humans

During
the
West
African
EVD
outbreak
,
EBOV
GP-specific
monoclonal
antibody
(
MAb
)
cocktails
(
e.g.
,
ZMapp
)
12
,
were
used
to
treat
several
patients
17-20
.

However
,
most
of
characterized
therapeutic
MAbs
to
date
are
EBOV
GP-specific
and
cross-neutralizing
activity
against
any
other
ebolavirus
species
(
e.g.
,
SUDV
and

RNA
viruses
are
characterized
by
a
high
mutation
rate
,
a
buffer
against
environmental
change
.

Nevertheless
,
the
means
by
which
random
mutation
improves
viral
fitness
is
not
well
characterized
.

Here
we
report
the
X-ray
crystal
structure
of
the
receptor-binding
domain
(
RBD
)
of
the
human
coronavirus
,
HCoV-229E
,
in
complex
with
the
ectodomain
of
its
receptor
,
aminopeptidase
N
(
APN
)
.

Three
extended
loops
are
solely
responsible
for
receptor
binding
and
the
evolution
of
HCoV-229E
and
its
close
relatives
is
accompanied
by
changing
loop-receptor
interactions
.

Phylogenetic
analysis
shows
that
the
natural
HCoV-229E
receptor-binding
loop
variation
observed
defines
six
RBD
classes
whose
viruses
have
successively
replaced
each
other
in
the
human
population
over
the
past
50
years
.

These
RBD
classes
differ
in
their
affinity
for
APN
and
their
ability
to
bind
an
HCoV-229E
neutralizing
antibody
.

Together
,
our
results
provide
a
model
for
alphacoronavirus
adaptation
and
evolution
based
on
the
use
of
extended
loops
for
receptor
binding
.

Background
:
Cutaneous
leishmaniasis
is
a
tropical
disease
affecting
over
one
million
patients
annually
and
Leishmania
(
L.
)
mexicana
is
one
of
the
major
etiological
agents
in
the
Americas
.

Here
we
established
the
first
experimental
infection
of
L.
(
L.
)
mexicana
in
canids
.

Methods
:
Beagle
dogs
were
infected
intradermally
with
culture-derived
L.
(
L.
)
mexicana
.

We
followed
skin
ulcer
development
,
histopathological
signs
,
parasite
burden
and
the
immune
status
of
the
infected
dogs
.

Results
:
All
infected
dogs
developed
uniform
oval-craterform
ulcers
similar
to
those
observed
in
humans
,
associated
with
mixed
T
helper
1/T
helper
2
immune
responses
.

Parasites
were
detected
in
the
healed
lesions
15
weeks
post-infection
.

Higher
anti-Leishmania
IgG
levels
correlated
with
larger
lesions
and
high
IgG1/IgG2
ratio
was
associated
with
some
level
of
splenomegaly
.

Conclusions
:
The
canine
model
described
in
this
work
will
be
of
use
for
further
understanding
of
L.

for

Gene
expression
studies
require
appropriate
normalization
methods
for
proper
evaluation
of
reference
genes
.

To
date
,
not
many
studies
have
been
reported
on
the
identification
of
suitable
reference
genes
in
buffaloes
.

The
present
study
was
undertaken
to
determine
the
panel
of
suitable
reference
genes
in
heat-stressed
buffalo
mammary
epithelial
cells
(
MECs
)
.

Briefly
,
MEC
culture
from
buffalo
mammary
gland
was
exposed
to
42
∘
C
for
one
hour
and
subsequently
allowed
to
recover
at
37
∘
C
for
different
time
intervals
(
from
30
m
to
48
h
)
.

Three
different
algorithms
,
geNorm
,
NormFinder
,
and
BestKeeper
softwares
,
were
used
to
evaluate
the
stability
of
16
potential
reference
genes
from
different
functional
classes
.

Our
data
identified
RPL4
,
EEF1A1
,
and
RPS23
genes
to
be
the
most
appropriate
reference
genes
that
could
be
utilized
for
normalization
of
qPCR
data
in
heat-stressed
buffalo
MECs
.

is
not
known
whether
they
edit
RNA
genomes
through
cytidine
deamination
.

Here
,
we
investigated
APOBEC3-mediated
restriction
of
Coronaviridae
.

In
experiments
in
vitro
,
three
human
APOBEC3
proteins
(
A3C
,
A3F
and
A3H
)
inhibited
HCoV-NL63
infection
and
limited
production
of
progeny
virus
,
but
did
not
cause
hypermutation
of
the
coronaviral
genome
.

APOBEC3-mediated
restriction
was
partially
dependent
on
enzyme
activity
,
and
was
reduced
by
the
use
of
enzymatically
inactive
APOBEC3
.

Moreover
,
APOBEC3
proteins
bound
to
the
coronaviral
nucleoprotein
,
and
this
interaction
also
affected
viral
replication
.

Although
the
precise
molecular
mechanism
of
deaminasedependent
inhibition
of
coronavirus
replication
remains
elusive
,
our
results
further
our
understanding
of
APOBEC-mediated
restriction
of
RNA
virus
infections
.

Apolipoprotein
B
mRNA-editing
enzyme
,
catalytic
polypeptide-like
type
3
(
APOBEC3
)
proteins
are
Zn
2+dependent
cytidine
deaminases
that
belong
to
the
APOBEC
superfamily
.

APOBEC3
enzymes
are
considered
to
be
part
of
the
intrinsic
defense
system
in
eukaryotic
cells
,
and
can
inhibit
replication
of
some
viruses
and
restrict
mobile
genetic
elements
.

All
APOBEC3
proteins
share
a
cytidine-deaminase
domain
,
which
is
identifiable
by
the
primary
amino
acid
motif
His-Xaa-Glu-Xaa
23-28
-Pro-Cys-Xaa
2-4
-Cys
,
in
which
Zn
2+
is
coordinated
.

Deamination
of
cytidine
results
in
its
conversion
to
uridine
.

During
this
process
,
the
ammonium
group
on
C
4
of
cytidine
undergoes
nucleophilic
attack
by
an
activated
water
molecule
and
the
APOBEC3
glutamate
residue
.

A
single
copy
of
a
gene
encoding
APOBEC3
is
found
in
the
genomes
of
rodents
,
cats
,
pigs
and
sheeps
,
with
two
genes
in
the
genomes
of
cows
,
three
the
genomes
of
dogs
and
horses
and
seven
genes
in
the
human
genome
,
encoding
A3A
,
A3B
,
A3C
,
A3D
,
A3F
,
A3G
and
A3H
1
.

The
mechanisms
and
selective
pressures
that
led
to
the
APOBEC3
gene
expansion
in
humans
are
unclear
,
but
it
is
believed
that
all
the
genes
originated
from
duplication
of
a
single-copy
primordial
APOBEC3
gene
.

This
multiplication
may
have
provided
protection
from
genomic
instability
caused
by
human
endogenous
retroviruses
and
retrotransposons
2
.

The
best-studied
protein
within
the
human
APOBEC3
family
is
A3G
.

Its
function
as
an
antiviral
factor
was
discovered
in
2002
through
cDNA-transfer
experiments
that
were
designed
to
identify
a
cellular
suppressor
of
an
HIV-1
accessory
protein
,
the
virion
infectivity
factor
(
Vif
)
.

The
primary
antiretroviral
activity
of
A3G
requires
its
encapsidation
into
HIV-1
particles
,
and
involves
cytidine
deamination
of
the
reverse-transcribed
first
viral
DNA
strand
,
with
mutations
becoming
fixed
as
G
to
A
changes
upon
second-strand
synthesis
.

Mutational
frequencies
can
exceed
10
%
of
all
G
residues
(
hypermutation
)
,
and
may
result
in
inhibition
of
viral
replication
.

This
activity
is
blocked
by
Vif
protein
,
which
specifically
binds
to
and
ubiquitinates
A3G
,
directing
it
for
degradation

the
most
important
causes
of
herpangina

hand

disease
.

It
can
also
cause
severe
complications

the
central

Brain
stem
encephalitis
with
pulmonary

is
the
severe
complication
that
can

EV71
replicates
in

and

play
an
important

Both
the
CNS
and
the
systemic
inflammatory
responses
to
infection
play
important
,
but
distinctly
different
,
roles
in
the
pathogenesis
of
EV71
pulmonary
edema
.

Administration
of
intravenous
immunoglobulin
and
milrinone
,
a
phosphodiesterase
inhibitor
,
has
been
shown
to
modulate
inflammation
,
to
reduce
sympathetic
overactivity
,
and
to
improve
survival
in
patients
with
EV71
autonomic
nervous
system
dysregulation
and
pulmonary
edema
.

In
spite
of
medical
breakthroughs
,
the
emergence
of
pathogens
continues
to
pose
threats
to
both
human
and
animal
populations
.

We
present
candidate
approaches
for
anticipating
disease
emergence
prior
to
large-scale
outbreaks
.

Through
use
of
ideas
from
the
theories
of
dynamical
systems
and
stochastic
processes
we
develop
approaches
which
are
not
specific
to
a
particular
disease
system
or
model
,
but
instead
have
general
applicability
.

The
indicators
of
disease
emergence
detailed
in
this
paper
can
be
classified
into
two
parallel
approaches
:
a
set
of
early-warning
signals
based
around
the
theory
of
critical
slowing
down
and
a
likelihood-based
approach
.

To
test
the
reliability
of
these
two
approaches
we
contrast
theoretical
predictions
with
simulated
data
.

We
find
good
support
for
our
methods
across
a
range
of
different
model
structures
and
parameter
values
.

Host
interferon-induced
transmembrane
proteins
(
IFITMs
)
are
broad-spectrum
antiviral
restriction
factors
.

Of
these
,
IFITM3
potently
inhibits
viruses
that
enter
cells
through
acidic
endosomes
,
many
of
which
are
zoonotic
and
emerging
viruses
with
bats
(
order
Chiroptera
)
as
their
natural
hosts
.

We
previously
demonstrated
that
microbat
IFITM3
is
antiviral
.

Here
,
we
show
that
bat
IFITMs
are
characterized
by
strong
adaptive
evolution
and
identify
a
highly
variable
and
functionally
important
site-codon
70-within
the
conserved
CD225
domain
of
IFITMs
.

Mutation
of
this
residue
in
microbat
IFITM3
impairs
restriction
of
representatives
of
four
different
virus
families
that
enter
cells
via
endosomes
.

This
mutant
shows
altered
subcellular
localization
and
reduced
S-palmitoylation
,
a
phenotype
copied
by
mutation
of
conserved
cysteine
residues
in
microbat
IFITM3
.

Furthermore
,
we
show
that
microbat
IFITM3
is
S-palmitoylated
on
cysteine
residues
C71
,
C72
,
and
C105
,
mutation
of
each
cysteine
individually
impairs
virus
restriction
,
and
a
triple

activity
,
concomitant
with
subcellular
re-localization
of
microbat
IFITM3
to
Golgi-associated
sites
.

Thus
,
we
propose
that
S-palmitoylation
is
critical
for
Chiropteran

function
and
identify
a
key
molecular
determinant
of

Since
its
first
report
in
the
Middle
East
in
2012
,
the
Middle
East
respiratory
syndrome-coronavirus
(
MERS-CoV
)
has
become
a
global
concern
due
to
the
high
morbidity
and
mortality
of
individuals
infected
with
the
virus
.

Although
the
majority
of
MERS-CoV
cases
have
been
reported
in
Saudi
Arabia
,
the
overall
risk
in
areas
outside
the
Middle
East
remains
significant
as
inside
Saudi
Arabia
.

Additional
pandemics
of
MERS-CoV
are
expected
,
and
thus
novel
tools
and
reagents
for
therapy
and
diagnosis
are
urgently
needed
.

Here
,
we
used
phage
display
to
develop
novel
monoclonal
antibodies
(
mAbs
)
that
target
MERS-CoV
.

A
human
Fab
phage
display
library
was
panned
against
the
S2
subunit
of
the
MERS-CoV
spike
protein
(
MERS-S2P
)
,
yielding
three
unique
Fabs
(
S2A3
,
S2A6
,
and
S2D5
)
.

The
Fabs
had
moderate
apparent
affinities
(
Half
maximal
effective
concentration
(
EC
50
=
123-421
nM
)
for
MERS-S2P
,
showed
no
cross-reactivity
to
spike
proteins
from
other
CoVs
,
and
were
non-aggregating
and
thermostable
(
T
m
=
61.5-80.4
•
C
)
.

Reformatting
the
Fabs
into
IgGs
(
Immunoglobulin
Gs
)
greatly
increased
their
apparent
affinities
(
K
D
=
0.17-1.2
nM
)
,
presumably
due
to
the
effects
of
avidity
.

These
apparent
affinities
were
notably
higher
than
that
of
a
previously
reported
anti-MERS-CoV
S2
reference
mAb
(
K
D
=
8.7
nM
)
.

Furthermore
,
two
of
the
three
mAbs
(
S2A3
and
S2D5
)
bound
only
MERS-CoV
(
Erasmus
Medical
Center
(
EMC
)
)
and
not
other
CoVs
,
reflecting
their
high
binding
specificity
.

However
,
the
mAbs
lacked
MERS-CoV
neutralizing
activity
.

Given
their
high
affinity
,
specificity
,
and
desirable
stabilities
,
we
anticipate
that
these
anti-MERS-CoV
mAbs
would
be
suitable
reagents
for
developing
antibody-based
diagnostics
in
laboratory
or
hospital
settings
for
point-of-care
testing

The
overall

,
the
country
in
which
most
of
the
cases

novel
tools

Among
the
four
coronavirus
genera

,
MERS-CoV

along
with
severe
acute
respiratory
syndrome
coronavirus
(
SARS-CoV

,
belongs
to
the
betacoronaviruses

MERS-CoV
is
an
enveloped
RNA
virus
with
a
positive-sense
,
single-stranded
RNA
genome

encodes
structural
proteins

Like

coronaviruses
,
the
S
protein
,
present
on
the
surface
of
the
MERS-CoV
virion

plays
a
critical
role
in
the
viral
entry
into
host
cells
[
5
,

.

The
S
protein
consists
of
two
non-covalently
associated
subunits
,
S1
and
S2
,
and
trimerizes
to
form

Upon

the

,
the

the

dipeptidyl

(
DPP4
)
or
CD26
[

,
while
the
S2
subunit
has
a
role
in
viral
fusion
with
host
cell
membranes
through
the
interplay
of
two
heptad

Vaccines
have
been
the
most
effective
prophylactic
tools
against
viral
infections
,
although
their
long
development
time
and
inability
to
confer
immediate
protection
or
therapy
are
significant
drawbacks
[

Neutralizing
monoclonal
antibodies

are
rapidly
emerging
as
an
alternative
approach
complementing
vaccines
against
viral
infections
[

.

Due
to
its
critical
role
in
the
interaction
with
host
cell
receptors
,
tremendous
efforts
have
been
focused
on
the
discovery

neutralizing
mAbs

Strategies
have

immunization

camels
;
and
antibody
isolation
from
human
survivors
of
MERS-CoV
infection
.

However
,
a
drawback
of
the
mAbs
is
their
costly
and
time-consuming
production
in
mammalian
cell
lines
.

Moreover
,
viruses
can
easily
evolve
to
generate
RBD
variants
with
mutations
that
avoid
immune
responses
[
19
,
20
]
.

However
,
such
mutations
are
less
common
in
the
S2
subunit
,
which
makes
it
an
attractive
target
for
therapeutic
purposes
.

Indeed
,
the
first
MERS-CoV
S2
subunit
(
MERS-S2P
)
-targeting
antibody
,
called
G4

was
generated
using
mouse
immunization
and
was
demonstrated
to
recognize
a
variable
loop
in
the
S2
connector
domain
and
to
neutralize
infection
by
the
virus

Although
anti-MERS-CoV
therapies
are
urgently
needed
,
there
is
currently
no
anti-viral
drug

vaccine
approved
for

Therefore
,
the
importance

developing
reliable

rapidly
becoming
clear
to
manage
and
control

Background
:

rotavirus

non-enveloped
dsRNA
virus
that
cause
neonatal
calf
diarrhea

Lipid
rafts
are
cholesterol-enrich
membrane
mircodomains
that
play
a
vital
role
in
many
cellular
processes

In
this

,
the
effect
of
cellular
cholesterol
depletion
on
infection
of
MA-104
cells
with
bovine
rotavirus
was
investigated
.

Results
:
We
demonstrated
that
cholesterol
depletion
of
the
plasma
membrane
by
MβCD
had
no
effect
on
BRV
binding
to
cells
but
significantly
impaired
BRV
entry
in
a
dose-dependent
manner
and
the
effect
was
partially
reversed
by
addition
of
exogenous
cholesterol
,
suggesting
the
reduction
of
BRV
infection
by
MβCD
was
specifically
due
to
cholesterol
depletion
.

Cholesterol
depletion
after
virus
entry
did
not
reduce
BRV
replication
,
whereas
affected
virus
assembly
.

Conclusions
:
Taken
together
,
our
results
demonstrate
that
cell
membrane
cholesterol
is
essential
to
BRV
infectivity

assessments
in
providing
a
framework
for
a
rapid
response

outbreaks
.

This
novel
approach
applies
a
scientific
process
,
widely
used
in
food
production
systems
,
to
assess
risks
related
to
a
specific
emerging
health
threat
within
a
known

We
conducted
a
HACCP
assessment
for
HPAI
viruses
within
Vietnam
's
domestic
poultry
trade
and
relate
our
findings
to
the
existing
literature
.

Our
HACCP
assessment
identified
poultry
flock
isolation
,
transportation
,
slaughter
,
preparation
and
consumption
as
critical
control
points
for
Vietnam
's
domestic
poultry
trade
.

Introduction
of
the
preventative
measures
highlighted
through
this
HACCP
evaluation
would
reduce
the
risks
posed
by
HPAI
viruses
and
pressure
on
the
national
economy
.

We
conclude
that
this
HACCP
assessment
provides
compelling
evidence
for
the
future
potential
that
HACCP
analyses
could
play
in
initiating
a
rapid

Background
:
WNV-associated
encephalitis

by
increased
production
of
pro-inflammatory
mediators

glial
cells
activation
and
eventual
loss
of
neurons
.

WNV
infection
of
neurons
is
rapidly
progressive
and
destructive
whereas
infection
of
non-neuronal
brain
cells
is
limited
.

However
,
the
role
of
neurons
and
pathological
consequences
of
pro-inflammatory
cytokines
released
as
a
result
of
WNV
infection
is
unclear
.

Therefore
,
the
objective
of
this
study
was
to
examine
the
role
of
key
cytokines
secreted
by
WNV-infected
neurons
in
mediating
neuroinflammatory
markers

of
neutralizing
antibodies
against
key
pro-inflammatory
cytokines
using
cell
viability
assay
,
TUNEL
and
flow
cytometry
.

Further
,
naïve
primary
astrocytes
were
treated
with
UV-inactivated
supernatant
from
mock-and
WNV-infected
SK-N-SH
cell
line
and
the
activation
of
astrocytes
was
measured
using
flow
cytometry
and
ELISA
.

Results
:
WNV-infected
SK-N-SH
cells
induced
the
expression
of
IL-1β
,
-6
,
-8
,
and
TNF-α
in
a
dose-and
timedependent
manner
,
which
coincided
with
increase
in
virus-induced
cell
death
.

Treatment
of
cells
with
anti-IL-1β
or
-TNF-α
resulted
in
significant
reduction
of
the
neurotoxic
effects
of
WNV
.

Furthermore
treatment
of
naïve
astrocytes
with
UV-inactivated
supernatant
from
WNV-infected
SK-N-SH
cell
line
increased
expression
of
glial
fibrillary
acidic
protein
and
key
inflammatory
cytokines
.

Conclusion
:
Our
results
for
the
first
time
suggest
that
neurons
are
one
of
the
potential
sources
of
proinflammatory
cytokines
in
WNV-infected
brain
and
these
neuron-derived
cytokines
contribute
to
WNV-induced
neurotoxicity
.

Moreover
,
cytokines
released
from
neurons
also
mediate
the
activation
of
astrocytes
.

Our
data
define
specific
role
(
s
)
of
WNV-induced
pro-inflammatory
cytokines
and
provide
a
framework
for
the
development
of
antiinflammatory
drugs
as
much-needed
therapeutic
interventions
to
limit
symptoms
associated
with
WNVE
.

In
a
novel
approach
,
the
standard
birth-death
process
is
extended
to
incorporate
a
fundamental
mechanism
undergone
by
intracellular
bacteria
,
phagocytosis
.

The
model
accounts
for
stochastic
interaction
between
bacteria
and
cells
of
the
immune
system
and
heterogeneity
in
susceptibility
to
infection
of
individual
hosts
within
a
population
.

Model
output
is
the
dose-response
relation
and
the
dose-dependent
distribution
of
time
until
response
,
where
response
is
the
onset
of
symptoms
.

The
model
is
thereafter
parametrized
with
respect
to
the
highly
virulent
Schu
S4
strain
of
Francisella
tularensis
,
in
the
first
such
study
to
consider
a
biologically
plausible
mathematical
model
for
early
human
infection
with
this
bacterium
.

Results
indicate
a
median
infectious
dose
of
about
23
organisms
,
which
is
higher
than
previously
thought
,
and
an
average
incubation
period
of
between
3
and
7
days
depending
on
dose
.

The
distribution
of
incubation
periods
is
right-skewed
up
to
about
100
organisms
and
symmetric
for
larger
doses
.

Moreover
,
there
are
some
interesting
parallels
to
the
hypotheses
of
some
of
the
classical
dose-response
models
,
such
as
independent
action
(
single-hit
model
)
and
individual
effective
dose
(
probit
model
)
.

The
findings
of
this
study
support
experimental
evidence
and
postulations
from
other
investigations
that
response
is
,
in
fact
,
influenced
by
both
in-host
and
between-host
variability
.

Background
:
A
broad
spectrum
of
pathogens
is
causative
for
respiratory
tract
infections
,
but
symptoms
are
mostly
similar
.

Therefore
,
the
identification
of
the
causative
viruses
and
bacteria
is
only
feasible
using
multiplex
PCR
or
several
monoplex
PCR
tests
in
parallel
.

Methods
:
The
analytical
sensitivity
of
three
multiplex
PCR
assays
,
RespiFinder-19
,
RespiFinder-SMART-22
and
xTAG-Respiratory-Virus-Panel-Fast-Assay
(
RVP
)
,
were
compared
to
monoplex
real-time
PCR
with
quantified
standardized
control
material
.

All
assays
include
the
most
common
respiratory
pathogens
.

Results
:
To
compare
the
analytical
sensitivity
of
the
multiplex
assays
,
samples
were
inoculated
with
13
different
quantified
viruses
in
the
range
of
10
1
to
10
5
copies/ml
.

Concordant
results
were
received
for
rhinovirus
,
whereas
the
RVP
detected
influenzavirus
,
RSV
and
hMPV
more
frequently
in
low
concentrations
.

The
RespiFinder-19
and
the
RespiFinder-SMART-22
showed
a
higher
analytical
sensitivity
for
adenoviruses
and
coronaviruses
,
whereas
the
RVP
was
incapable
to
detect
adenovirus
and
coronavirus
in
concentrations
of
10
4
copies/ml
.

The
RespiFinder-19
and
RespiFinder-SMART-22A
did
not
detect
influenzaviruses
(
10
4
copies/ml
)
and
RSV
(
10
3
copies/ml
)
.

The
detection
of
all
13
viruses
in
one
sample
was
only
achieved
using
monoplex
PCR
.

To
analyze
possible
competitive
amplification
reactions
between
the
different
viruses
,
samples
were
further
inoculated
with
only
4
different
viruses
in
one
sample
.

Compared
to
the
detection
of
13
viruses
in
parallel
,
only
a
few
differences
were
found
.

The
incidence
of
respiratory
viruses
was
compared
in
tracheal
secretion
(
TS
)
samples
(
n
=
100
)
of
mechanically
ventilated
patients
in
winter
(
n
=
50
)
and
summer
(
n
=
50
)
.

In
winter
,
respiratory
viruses
were
detected
in
32
TS
samples
(
64
%
)
by
RespiFinder-19
,
whereas
the
detection
rate
with
RVP
was
only
22
%
.

The
most
frequent
viruses
were
adenovirus
(
32
%
)
and
PIV-2
(
20
%
)
.

Multiple
infections
were
detected
in
16
TS
samples
(
32
%
)
by
RespiFinder-19
.

Fewer
infections
were
found
in
summer
(
RespiFinder-19
:
20
%
;
RVP
:
6
%
)
.

All
positive
results
were
verified
using
monoplex
PCR
.

Conclusions
:
Multiplex
PCR
tests
have
a
broad
spectrum
of
pathogens
to
test
at
a
time
.

Analysis
of
multiple

Analysis
of

Porcine
epidemic
diarrhea
virus
(
PEDV
)
is
the
main
causative
agent
of
porcine
diarrhea
,
which
has
resulted
in
devastating
damage
to
swine
industry
and
become
a
perplexed
global
problem
.

PEDV
infection
causes
lesions
and
clinical
symptoms
,
and
infected
pigs
often
succumb
to
severe
dehydration
.

If
there
is
not
a
timely
and
effective
method
to
control
its
infection
,
PEDV
will
spread
rapidly
across
the
whole
swine
farm
.

Therefore
,
preclinical
identification
of
PEDV
is
of
great
significance
for
preventing
the
outbreak
and
spread
of
this
disease
.

In
this
study
,
a
functionalized
nanoparticles-based
PCR
method
(
UNDP-PCR
)
specific
for
PEDV
was
developed
through
systematic
optimization
of
functionalized
magnetic
beads
and
gold
nanoparticles
which
were
further
used
to
specifically
enrich
viral
RNA
from
the
lysate
of
PEDV
stool
samples
,
forming
a
MMPs-RNA-AuNPs
complex
.

Then
,
oligonucleotides
specific
for
PEDV
coated
on
AuNPs
were
eluted
from
the
complex
and
were
further
amplified
and
characterized
by
PCR
.

The
detection
limitation
of
the
established
UNDP-PCR
method
for
PEDV
was
25
copies
in
per
gram
PEDV
stool
samples
,
which
is
400-fold
more
sensitive
than
conventional
RT-PCR
for
stool
samples
.

The
UNDP-PCR
for
PEDV
exhibited
reliable
reproducibility
and
high
specificity
,
no
cross-reaction
was
observed
with
other
porcine
viruses
.

In
153
preclinical
fecal
samples
,
the
positive
detection
rate
of
UNDP-PCR
specific
for
PEDV
(
30.72
%
)
was
much
higher
than
that
of
conventional
RT-PCR
(

Introduction
During
the
2003
severe
acute
respiratory
syndrome
(
SARS
)
crisis
,
we
proposed
and
tested
a
new
protocol
for
cardiac
arrest
in
a
patient
with
SARS
.

The
protocol
was
rapidly
and
effectively
instituted
by
teamwork
training
using
high-fidelity
simulation
.

Methods
Phase
1
was
a
curriculum
design
of
a
SARS-specific
cardiac
arrest
protocol
in
three
steps
:
planning
the
new
protocol
,
repeated
simulations
of
this
protocol
in
a
classroom
,
and
a
subsequent
simulation
of
a
cardiac
arrest
on
a
hospital
ward
.

Phase
2
was
the
training
of
275
healthcare
workers
(
HCWs
)
using
the
new
protocol
.

Training
involved
a
seminar
,
practice
in
wearing
the
mandatory
personal
protection
system
(
PPS
)
,
and
cardiac
arrest
simulations
with
subsequent
debriefing
.

Results
Simulation
provided
insights
that
had
not
been
considered
in
earlier
phases
of
development
.

For
example
,
a
single
person
can
don
a
PPS
worn
for
the
SARS
patient
in
1
1/
2
minutes
.

However
,
when
multiple
members
of
a
cardiac
arrest
team
were
dressing
simultaneously
,
the
time
to
don
the
PPS
increased
to
between
3
1/2
and
5
1/2
minutes
.

Errors
in
infection
control
as
well
as
in
medical
management
of
advanced
cardiac
life
support
(
ACLS
)
were
corrected
.

Conclusion
During
the
SARS
crisis
,
real-time
use
of
a
highfidelity
simulator
allowed
the
training
of
275
HCWs
in
2
weeks
,
with
debriefing
and
error
management
.

HCWs
were
required
to
manage
the
SARS
cardiac
arrest
wearing
unfamiliar
equipment
and
following
a
modified
ACLS
protocol
.

The
insight
gained
from
this
experience
will
be
valuable
for
future
infectious
disease
challenges
in
critical
care
.

Background
:
Vaccination
is
the
key
measure
available
for
prevention
of
the
public
health
burden
of
annual
influenza
epidemics
.

This
article
describes
national
trends
in
seasonal
influenza
vaccine
(
IV
)
coverage
in
Portugal
from
1998/99
to
2010/11
,
analyzes
progress
towards
meeting
WHO
2010
coverage
goals
,
and
addresses
the
effect
of
major
public
health
threats
of
the
last
12
years
(
SARS
in
2003/04
,

trends
.

Methods
:
The
National
Institute
of
Health
surveyed
(
12
times
)
a
random
sample
of
Portuguese
families
.

IV
coverage
was
estimated
and
was
adjusted
for
age
distribution
and
country
region
.

Independence
of
age
and
sex
coverage
distribution
was
tested
using
a
modified
F-statistic
with
a
5

significance
level
.

The
effect
of
SARS
,
A
(
H5N1
)
,
and
the
A
(
H1N1
)
2009
pandemic
was
tested
using
a
meta-regression
model
.

The
model
was
adjusted
for
IV
coverage
in
the
general
population
and
in
the
age
groups
.

Results
:
Between
1998/99
and
2010/11
IV
,
coverage
in
the
general
population
varied
between
14.2
%
(
CI
95

)
and
17.5
%
(
CI

-21.6
%
)
.

There
was
no
trend
in
coverage
(
p
=
0.097
)
.

In
the
younger
age
group
(
<
15
years
)
a
declining
trend
was
identified
until
2008/09
(
p
=
0.005
)
.

This
trend
reversed
in
2009/10
.

There
was
also
a
gradual
and
significant
increase
in
seasonal
IV
coverage
in
the
elderly
(
p
for
trend
<
0.001
)
.

After
2006/07
,
IV
coverage
remained
near
50
%
.

Adjusting
for
baseline
trends
,
there
was
significantly
higher
coverage
in
the
general
population
in
2003/04
(
p
=
0.032
)
and
2005/06
(
p
=
0.018
)
.

The
high
coverage
observed
in
the
<
15-year
age
group
in
season
2009/10
was
also
significant
(

)
.

Conclusions
:
IV
coverage
in
the
elderly
population
displayed
an
increasing
trend
,
but
the
75
%
WHO
2010
target
was
not
met
.

This
result
indicates
that
influenza
vaccination
strategy
should
be
improved
to
meet
the
ambitious
WHO
coverage
goals
.

The
major
pandemic
threats
of
the
past
decade
had
a
modest
but
significant
effect
on
seasonal
influenza
vaccination
.

There
was
an
increase
in
vaccine
uptake
proportion
in
the
general
population
in
2003/04
and
in
2005/06
,
and
in
individuals
<
15
years
old
in
2009/10
.

Musk
of
musk
deer
has
been
one
of
the
most
precious
traditional
medicinal
materials
for
treatment
of
stroke
,
but
trading
is
prohibited
.

Musk
of
muskrat
,
Ondatra
zibethicus
,
is
an
accessible
substitute
for
musk
of
musk
deer
.

However
,
neuroprotective
effects
of
the
musk
of
muskrat
on
stroke
model
are
so
far
unclear
.

Aim
of
the
study
is
to
determine
neuroprotective
effects
of
the
musk
of
muskrat
on
focal
cerebral
ischemia
.

The
protective
effects
against
focal
cerebral
ischemia
were
evaluated
using
a
model
of
middle
cerebral
artery
occlusion
(
90-minute
occlusion
followed
by
24-hour
reperfusion
)
.

Musk
of
muskrat
was
collected
from
scent
bag
of
muskrat
and
orally
administered
at
doses
of
100
and
300
mg/kg
twice
at
times
of
0
and
90
min
after
occlusion
.

The
effects
on
sensorimotor
dysfunction
were
investigated
by
using
balance
beam
test
and
rotarod
test
after
brain
ischemia
.

The
expression
of
cyclooxygenase-2
(
COX-2
)
was
investigated
by
immunohistochemistry
.

Oral
administration
of
musk
at
300
mg/kg
significantly
reduced
(
p
<
0.001
)
the
infarct
volume
by
32.4
%
compared
with
a
vehicle-treated
group
.

Oral
administration
of
musk
at
300
mg/kg
also
ameliorated
ischemia-induced
spontaneous
and
vestibule
sensorimotor
dysfunction
in
balance
beam
test
and
rotarod
test
compared
with
control
group
and
COX-2
upregulation
.

Musk
of
muskrat
may
have
neuroprotective
effects
against
transient
focal
cerebral
ischemia
with
recovery
of
sensorimotor
dysfunction
.

Regarding
the
immunohistochemistry
,
the
effects
of
muskrat
may
be
due
to
anti-inflammatory
properties
through
inhibition
of
COX-2
expressions
.

Biodegradable
nanoparticle-based
vaccine
development
research
is
unexplored
in
large
animals
and
humans
.

In
this
study
,
we
illustrated
the
efficacy
of
nanoparticle-entrapped
UV-killed
virus
vaccine
against
an
economically
important
respiratory
viral
disease
of
pigs
called
porcine
reproductive
and
respiratory
syndrome
virus
(
PRRSV
)
.

We
entrapped
PLGA
[
poly
(
lactideco-glycolides
)
]
nanoparticles
with
killed
PRRSV
antigens
(
Nano-KAg
)
and
detected
its
phagocytosis
by
pig
alveolar
macrophages
.

Single
doses
of
Nano-KAg
vaccine
administered
intranasally
to
pigs
upregulated
innate
and
PRRSV
specific
adaptive
responses
.

In
a
virulent
heterologous
PRRSV
challenge
study
,
Nano-KAg
vaccine
significantly
reduced
the
lung
pathology
and
viremia
,
and
the
viral
load
in
the
lungs
.

Immunologically
,
enhanced
innate
and
adaptive
immune
cell
population
and
associated
cytokines
with
decreased
secretion
of
immunosuppressive
mediators
were
observed
at
both
mucosal
sites
and
blood
.

In
summary
,
we
demonstrated
the
benefits
of
intranasal
delivery
of
nanoparticle-based
viral
vaccine
in
eliciting
cross-protective
immune
response
in
pigs
,

potential
large
animal
model

Introduction
:
Currently
,
little
is
known
about
the
immunological
characteristics
of
patients
with
avian
influenza
A
(
H7N9
)
virus
infection
.

The
numbers
and
percentages
of
peripheral
blood
immune
cells
were
measured
in
27
patients
with
laboratory-confirmed
H7N9
virus
infection
and
30
healthy
controls
(
HCs
)
.

The
functional
phenotypes
of
T
cells
and
monocytes
,
as
well
as
serum
cytokine
levels
,
were
analyzed
by
flow
cytometry
.

Results
:
There
were
19
patients
(
70.4
%
)
with
acute
respiratory
distress
syndrome
,
13
(
48.1
%
)
with
secondary
respiratory
infection
,
20
(
74
%
)
with
systemic
inflammatory
response
syndrome
(
SIRS
;
defined
as
having
at
least
two
concurrent
SIRS
components
)
,
18
(
66.7
%
)
with
lymphocytopenia
and
11
(
40.7
%
)
with
reduced
numbers
of
monocytes
.

In
comparison
with
levels
in
the
HCs
,
the
levels
of
serum
interleukin
6
(
IL-6
)
,
IL-8
and
IL-10
and
the
percentages
of
CD38+
or
Tim-3+
T
cells
were
significantly
increased
.

However
,
the
percentages
of
human
leukocyte
antigen-DR
+
and
Tim-3+
monocytes
were
significantly
decreased
in
patients
compared
with
HCs
.

Conclusions
:
Patients
with
avian
H7N9
virus
infection
display
profound
SIRS
concomitantly
with
an
anti-inflammatory
response
,
which
may
be
associated
with
the
rapid
progression
of
and
high
mortality
associated
with
this
novel
viral
disease

Throughout
evolutionary
history
,
humans
have
been
exposed
to
a
wide
variety
of
diseases
,
some
of
which
have
serious
and
even
lethal
consequences
.

Memorizing
medicinal
plants
for
the
treatment
of
serious
diseases
likely
maximized
the
chances
of
survival
and
reproduction
and
was
instrumental
in
the
evolutionary
success
of
our
species
.

In
the
present
study
,
we
used
the
idea
of
adaptive
memory
to
understand
whether
human
memory
evolved
to
recall
information
about
medicinal
plants
for
the
treatment
of
serious
diseases
.

We
considered
plant-disease
pairs
of
words
as
units
of
information
available
in
a
medical
system
based
on
the
use
of
medicinal
plants
.

The
pairs
included
in
the
categories
of
chronic
infectious
diseases
and
transmissible
infectious
diseases
were
considered
to
be
of
higher
adaptive
value
,
whereas
those
included
in
the
category
of
common
conditions
were
considered
to
be
of
lower
adaptive
value
.

Pairs
grouped
into
the
category
of
emerging
and
reemerging
diseases
were
employed
to
investigate
conformity
bias
;
pairs
belonging
to
the
category
esthetic
uses
were
considered
to
be
of
little
adaptive
relevance
and
utilized
as
an
experimental
control
.

Our
results
revealed
that
plant-disease
pairs
associated
with
the
category
of
common
conditions
,
considered
by
us
to
be
of
lower
severity
and
less
adaptive
relevance
for
humans
,
were
better
remembered
and
retained
in
the
participants
'
memory
.

We
believe
that
prior
experience
with
common
conditions
and
the
frequency
of
these
conditions
in
the
population
may
have
intensified
the
ability
to
remember
the
plant-disease
pairs
associated
with
this
group
of
diseases

the
pandemic
flu
,
Influenza
A
H1N1
(
Swine
Flu
)
in
early
2009
,
provided
a
major
challenge
to
health
services
around
the
world
.

Previous
pandemics
have
led
to
stockpiling
of
goods
,
the
victimisation
of
particular
population
groups
,
and
the
cancellation
of
travel
and
the
boycotting
of
particular
foods
(
e.g
.

pork
)
.

We
examined
initial
behavioural
and

Conclusion
:
Initial
responses
to
Influenza
A
show
large
regional
differences
in
anxiety
,
with
Malaysians
more
anxious
and
more
likely
to
reduce
travel
and
to
buy
masks
and
food
.

Discussions
with
family
and
friends
may
reinforce
existing
anxiety
levels
.

Particular
groups
(
homosexuals
,
prostitutes
,
the
homeless
)
are
perceived
as
at
greater
risk
,
potentially
leading
to
increased
prejudice
during
a
pandemic
.

Europeans
underestimated
mortality
of
seasonal
flu
,
and
require
more
information
about
the
protection
given
by
seasonal
flu
inoculation
.

The
International
Health
Regulations
(
2005
)
and
the
emergence
and
global
spread
of
infectious
diseases
have
triggered
a
re-assessment
of
how
rich
countries
should
support
capacity
development
for
communicable
disease
control
in
low
and
medium
income
countries
(
LMIC
)
.

In
LMIC
,
three
types
of
public
health
training
have
been
tried
:
the
university-based
model
;
streamed
training
for
specialised
workers
;
and
field-based
programs
.

The
first
has
low
rates
of
production
and
teaching
may
not
always
be
based
on
the
needs
and
priorities
of
the
host
country
.

The
second
model
is
efficient
,
but
does
not
accord
the
workers
sufficient
status
to
enable
them
to
impact
on
policy
.

The
third
has
the
most
potential
as
a
capacity
development
measure
for
LMIC
,
but
in
practice
faces
challenges
which
may
limit
its
ability
to
promote
capacity
development
.

We
describe
Australia
's
first
Master
of
Applied
Epidemiology
(
MAE
)
model
(
established
in
1991
)
,
which
uses
field-based
training
to
strengthen
the
control
of
communicable
diseases
.

A
central
attribute
of
this
model
is
the
way
it
partners
and
complements
health
department
initiatives
to
enhance
workforce
skills
,
health
system
performance
and
the
evidencebase
for
policies
,
programs
and
practice
.

The
MAE
experience
throws
light
on
ways
Australia
could
collaborate
in
regional
capacity
development
initiatives
.

Key
needs
are
a
shared
vision
for
a
regional
approach
to
integrate
training
with
initiatives
that
strengthen
service
and
research
,
and
the
pooling
of
human
,
financial
and
technical
resources
.

We
focus
on
communicable
diseases
,
but
our
findings
and
recommendations
are
generalisable
to
other
areas
of
public
health
.

Human
coronaviruses
(
CoVs
)
are
increasingly
recognized
as
important
respiratory
pathogens
associated
with
a
broad
range
of
clinical
diseases
.

We
sought
to
increase
the
insight
into
clinically
relevant
CoV
infections
by
monitoring
antigen
concentrations
in
six
confirmed
CoV-positive
patients
using
a
newly
developed
assay
for
rapid
detection
of
CoV
OC43
infections
.

Antigen
positivity
lasted
3
to
6
days
in
secondary
infections
and
13
days
in
primary
infection
.

CoV
infections
are
clinically
diverse
,
are
common
,
and
can
not
be
diagnosed
from
clinical
symptoms
alone
.

Central
nervous
system
(
CNS
)
dysfunction
caused
by
neurovirulent
influenza
viruses
is
a
dreaded
complication
of
infection
,
and
may
play
a
role
in
some
neurodegenerative
conditions
,
such
as
Parkinson-like
diseases
and
encephalitis
lethargica
.

Although
CNS
infection
by
highly
pathogenic
H5N1
virus
has
been
demonstrated
,
it
is
unknown
whether
H5N1
infects
neural
progenitor
cells
,
nor
whether
such
infection
plays
a
role
in
the
neuroinflammation
and
neurodegeneration
.

To
pursue
this
question
,
we
infected
human
neural
progenitor
cells
(
hNPCs
)
differentiated
from
human
embryonic
stem
cells
in
vitro
with
H5N1
virus
,
and
studied
the
resulting
cytopathology
,
cytokine
expression
,
and
genes
involved
in
the
differentiation
.

Human
embryonic
stem
cells
(
BG01
)
were
maintained
and
differentiated
into
the
neural
progenitors
,
and
then
infected
by
H5N1
virus
(
A/Chicken/Thailand/CUK2/04
)
at
a
multiplicity
of
infection
of
1
.

At
6
,
24
,
48
,
and
72
hours
post-infection
(
hpi
)
,
cytopathic
effects
were
observed
.

Then
cells
were
characterized
by
immunofluorescence
and
electron
microscopy
,
supernatants
quantified
for
virus
titers
,
and
sampled
cells
studied
for
candidate
genes.The
hNPCs
were
susceptible
to
H5N1
virus
infection
as
determined
by
morphological
observation
and
immunofluorescence
.

The
infection
was
characterized
by
a
significant
up-regulation
of
TNF-α
gene
expression
,
while
expressions
of
IFN-α2
,
IFN-β1
,
IFN-γ
and
IL-6
remained
unchanged
compared
to
mock-infected
controls
.

Moreover
,
H5N1
infection
did
not
appear
to
alter
expression
of
neuronal
and
astrocytic
markers
of
hNPCs
,
such
as
β-III
tubulin
and
GFAP
,
respectively
.

The
results
indicate
that
hNPCs
support
H5N1
virus
infection
and
may
play
a
role
in
the
neuroinflammation
during
acute
viral
encephalitis
.

Macrophages
have
important
protective
functions
during
infection
with
herpes
simplex
virus
type
1
(
HSV-1
)
.

However
,
molecular
mechanisms
that
restrict
viral
propagation
and
protect
from
severe
disease
are
unclear
.

Here
we
show
that
macrophages
take
up
HSV-1
via
endocytosis
and
transport
the
virions
into
multivesicular
bodies
(
MVBs
)
.

In
MVBs
,
acid
ceramidase
(
aCDase
)
converts
ceramide
into
sphingosine
and
increases
the
formation
of
sphingosine-rich
intraluminal
vesicles
(
ILVs
)
.

Once
HSV-1
particles
reach
MVBs
,
sphingosine-rich
ILVs
bind
to
HSV-1
particles
,
which
restricts
fusion
with
the
limiting
endosomal
membrane
and
prevents
cellular
infection
.

Lack
of
aCDase
in
macrophage
cultures
or
in
Asah1
−/−
mice
results
in
replication
of
HSV-1
and
Asah1
−/−
mice
die
soon
after
systemic
or
intravaginal
inoculation
.

The
treatment
of
macrophages
with
sphingosine
enhancing
compounds
blocks
HSV-1
propagation
,
suggesting
a
therapeutic
potential
of
this
pathway
.

In
conclusion
,
aCDase
loads
ILVs
with
sphingosine
,
which
prevents
HSV-1
capsids
from
penetrating
into
the
cytosol
.

Emergent
wheezing
illnesses
during
childhood
can
be
linked
to
infection
with
rhinovirus
in
Trinidad
's
tropical
environment
.

Viral-induced
exacerbations
of
asthma
are
independent
of
seasons
in
this
tropical
climate
.

Further
clinical
and

role
of

Background
:
Influenza
is
a
respiratory
disease
that
seriously
threatens
human
health
.

In
fact
,
influenza
virus
itself
does
not
make
critical
contribution
to
mortality
induced
by
influenza
,
but
``
cytokine
storm
''
produced
by
the
excessive
immune
response
triggered
by
the
virus
can
result
in
inflammatory
reaction
of
lung
tissues
and
fatal
lung
tissue
injury
,
and
thus
increase
influenza
mortality
.

Therefore
,
besides
antiviral
drugs
,
immunosuppression
drugs
should
also
be
included
in
infection
treatment
.

Presentation
of
the
hypothesis
:
Complement
is
the
center
of
inflammatory
reaction
.

If
complement
system
is
over
activated
,
the
body
will
have
strong
inflammatory
reaction
or
tissue
injury
,
resulting
in
pathological
process
.

Many
studies
have
proved
that
,
inflammatory
injury
of
lung
tissues
caused
by
influenza
virus
is
closely
related
to
complement
activation
.

Therefore
,
inhibiting
complement
activation
can
significantly
reduce
inflammatory
injury
in
lung
tissues
.

As
complement
is
both
a
physiological
defense
and
pathological
damage
medium
,
systematic
inhibition
may
result
in
side
effects
including
infection
.

Therefore
,
we
design
targeting
complement
inhibitors
for
complement
activation
sites
,
i.e
.

with
CR2
as
targeting
vector
,
complement
inhibitors
like
CD59
and
Crry
are
targeted
to
inflammatory
sites
to
specially
inhibit
the
complement
activation
in
local
injury
,
thus
local
inflammatory
reaction
is
inhibited
.

The
emergence
of
neurotropic
Zika
virus
(
ZIKV
)
raised
a
public
health
emergency
of
global
concern
.

ZIKV
can
cross
the
placental
barrier
and
infect
foetal
brains
,
resulting
in
microcephaly
,
but
the
pathogenesis
of
ZIKV
is
poorly
understood
.

With
recent
findings
reporting
AXL
as
a
type
I
interferon
antagonist
rather
than
an
entry
receptor
,
the
exact
entry
mechanism
remains
unresolved
.

Here
we
report
that
cell
surface
sialic
acid
plays
an
important
role
in
ZIKV
infection
.

Removal
of
cell
surface
sialic
acid
by
neuraminidase
significantly
abolished
ZIKV
infection
in
Vero
cells
and
human
induced-pluripotent
stem
cells-derived
neural
progenitor
cells
.

Furthermore
,
knockout
of
the
sialic
acid
biosynthesis
gene
encoding
UDP-N-acetylglucosamine-2-epimerase/N-acetylmannosamine
kinase
resulted
in
significantly
less
ZIKV
infection
of
both
African
and
Asian
lineages
.

Huh7
cells
deficient
in
α2,3-linked
sialic
acid
through
knockout
of
ST3
βgalactoside-α2,3-sialyltransferase
4
had
significantly
reduced
ZIKV
infection
.

Removal
of
membrane-bound
,
uninternalized
virus
with
pronase
treatment
revealed
the
role
of
sialic
acid
in
ZIKV
internalization
but
not
attachment
.

Sialyllactose
inhibition
studies
showed
that
there
is
no
direct
interaction
between
sialic
acid
and
ZIKV
,
implying
that
sialic
acid
could
be
mediating
ZIKV-receptor
complex
internalization
.

Identification
of
α2,3-linked
sialic
acid
as
an
important
host
factor
for
ZIKV
internalization
provides
new
insight
into
ZIKV
infection
and
pathogenesis
.

Picornaviruses
are
associated
with
acute
and
chronic
diseases
.

The
clinical
manifestations
of
infections
are
often
mild
,
but
infections
may
also
lead
to
respiratory
symptoms
,
gastroenteritis
,
myocarditis
,
meningitis
,
hepatitis
,
and
poliomyelitis
,
with
serious
impacts
on
human
health
and
economic
losses
in
animal
husbandry
.

Thus
far
,
research
on
picornaviruses
has
mainly
focused
on
structural
proteins
such
as
VP1
,
whereas
the
non-structural
protein
2B
,
which
plays
vital
roles
in
the
life
cycle
of
the
viruses
and
exhibits
a
viroporin
or
viroporin-like
activity
,
has
been
overlooked
.

Viroporins
are
viral
proteins
containing
at
least
one
amphipathic
α-helical
structure
,
which
oligomerizes
to
form
transmembrane
hydrophilic
pores
.

In
this
review
,
we
mainly
summarize
recent
research
data
on
the
viroporin
or
viroporin-like
activity
of
2B
proteins
,
which
affects
the
biological
function
of
the
membrane
,
regulates
cell
death
,
and
affects
the
host
immune
response
.

Considering
these
mechanisms
,
the
potential
application
of
the
2B
protein
as
a
candidate
target
for
antiviral
drug
development
is
discussed
,
along
with
research
challenges
and
prospects
toward
realizing
a
novel
treatment
strategy
for
picornavirus
infections
.

One
of
the
hurdles
to
understanding
the
role
of
viral
quasispecies
in
RNA
virus
cross-species
transmission
(
CST
)
events
is
the
need
to
analyze
a
densely
sampled
outbreak
using
deep
sequencing
in
order
to
measure
the
amount
of
mutation
occurring
on
a
small
time
scale
.

In
2009
,
the
California
Department
of
Public
Health
reported
a
dramatic
increase
(
.350
%
)
in
the
number
of
gray
foxes
infected
with
a
rabies
virus
variant
for
which
striped
skunks
serve
as
a
reservoir
host
in
Humboldt
County
.

To
better
understand
the
evolution
of
rabies
,
deep-sequencing
was
applied
to
40
unpassaged
rabies
virus
samples
from
the
Humboldt
outbreak
.

For
each
sample
,
approximately
11
kb
of
the
12
kb
genome
was
amplified
and
sequenced
using
the
Illumina
platform
.

Average
coverage
was
17,4486and
this
allowed
characterization
of
the
rabies
virus
population
present
in
each
sample
at
unprecedented
depths
.

Phylogenetic
analysis
of
the
consensus
sequence
data
demonstrated
that
samples
clustered
according
to
date
(
1995
vs.
2009
)
and
geographic
location
(
northern
vs.
southern
)
.

A
single
amino
acid
change
in
the
G
protein
distinguished
a
subset
of
northern
foxes
from
a
haplotype
present
in
both
foxes
and
skunks
,
suggesting
this
mutation
may
have
played
a
role
in
the
observed
increased
transmission
among
foxes
in
this
region
.

Deepsequencing
data
indicated
that
many
genetic
changes
associated
with
the
CST
event
occurred

These
results
suggest
that
analysis
of
rare

within
a
viral
population
may
yield
clues
to

A
new
algorithm
for
assessing
similarity
between
primer
and
template
has
been
developed
based
on
the
hypothesis
that
annealing
of
primer
to
template
is
an
information
transfer
process
.

Results
:
Primer
sequence
is
converted
to
a
vector

of
the

The

An

is
calculated
as
a

for
fidelity
of
this

thus
a

Background
:
Coronaviruses
(
CoVs
)
primarily
cause
enzootic
infections
in
birds
and
mammals
but
,
in
the
last
few
decades
,
have
shown
to
be
capable
of
infecting
humans
as
well
.

The
outbreak
of
severe
acute
respiratory
syndrome
(
SARS
)
in
2003
and
,
more
recently
,
Middle-East
respiratory
syndrome
(
MERS
)
has
demonstrated
the
lethality
of
CoVs
when
they
cross
the
species
barrier
and
infect
humans
.

A
renewed
interest
in
coronaviral
research
has
led
to
the
discovery
of
several
novel
human
CoVs
and
since
then
much
progress
has
been
made
in
understanding
the
CoV
life
cycle
.

The
CoV
envelope
(
E
)
protein
is
a
small
,
integral
membrane
protein
involved
in
several
aspects
of
the
virus
'
life
cycle
,
such
as
assembly
,
budding
,
envelope
formation
,
and
pathogenesis
.

Recent
studies
have
expanded
on
its
structural
motifs
and
topology
,
its
functions
as
an
ion-channelling
viroporin
,
and
its
interactions
with
both
other
CoV
proteins
and
host
cell
proteins
.

Main
body
:
This
review
aims
to
establish
the
current
knowledge
on
CoV
E
by
highlighting
the
recent
progress
that
has
been
made
and
comparing
it
to
previous
knowledge
.

It
also
compares
E
to
other
viral
proteins
of
a
similar
nature
to
speculate
the
relevance
of
these
new
findings
.

Good
progress
has
been
made
but
much
still
remains
unknown
and
this
review
has
identified
some
gaps
in
the
current
knowledge
and
made
suggestions
for
consideration
in
future
research
.

The
most
progress
has
been
made
on
SARS-CoV
E
,
highlighting
specific
structural
requirements
for
its
functions
in
the
CoV
life
cycle
as
well
as
mechanisms
behind
its
pathogenesis
.

Data
shows
that
E
is
involved
in
critical
aspects
of
the
viral
life
cycle
and
that
CoVs
lacking
E
make
promising
vaccine
candidates
.

The
high
mortality
rate
of
certain
CoVs
,
along
with
their
ease
of
transmission
,
underpins
the
need
for
more
research
into
CoV
molecular
biology
which
can
aid
in
the
production
of
effective
anti-coronaviral
agents
for
both
human
CoVs
and
enzootic
CoVs
.

Middle
East
respiratory
syndrome
(
MERS
)
is
an
emerging
respiratory
disease
caused
by
the
MERS
coronavirus
(
MERS-CoV
)
.

MERS
has
been
endemic
to
Saudi
Arabia
since
2012
.

The
reservoir
of
MERS-CoV
is
the
dromedary
camel
,
suggesting
that
MERS
is
primarily
a
zoonotic
disease
.

MERS-CoV
is
common
in
dromedaries
throughout
the
Middle
East
,
North
Africa
,
and
East
Africa
as
evidenced
by
neutralizing
antibodies
against
MERS-CoV
;
however
,
human
cases
have
remained
limited
to
the
Middle
East
.

To
better
understand
the
cause
of
this
difference
,
the
virological
properties
of
African
camel
MERS-CoV
were
analyzed
based
on
the
spike
(
S
)
protein
in
Ethiopia
.

Nasal
swabs
were
collected
from
258
young
dromedaries
(
≤
2
years
old
)
in
the
Afar
region
of
Ethiopia
,
of
which
39
were
positive
for
MERS-CoV
,
as
confirmed
by
genetic
tests
.

All
positive
tests
were
exclusive
to
the
Amibara
woreda
region
.

Using
next-generation
sequencing
,
two
full-length
genomes
of
Amibara
isolates
were
successfully
decoded
;
both
isolates
belonged
to
the
C2
clade
based
on
phylogenetic
analysis
of
full-length
and
S
protein
sequences
.

Recombinant
EMC
isolates
of
MERS-CoV
,
in
which
the
S
protein
is
replaced
with
those
of
Amibara
isolates
,
were
then
generated
to
test
the
roles
of
these
proteins
in
viral
properties
.

Amibara
S
recombinants
replicated
more
slowly
in
cultured
cells
than
in
EMC
S
recombinants
.

In
neutralizing
assays
,
Amibara
S
recombinants
were
neutralized
by
lower
concentrations
of
sera
from
both
Ethiopian
dromedaries
and
EMC
isolate
(
wild-type
)
immunized
mouse
sera
,
relative
to
the
EMC
S
recombinants
,
indicating
that
viruses
coated
in
the
Amibara
S
protein
were
easier
to
neutralize
than
the
EMC
S
protein
.

Neutralization
experiments
performed
using
S1/S2
chimeric
recombinants
of
the
EMC
and
Amibara
S
proteins
showed
that
the
neutralization
profile
was
dependent
on
the
S1
region
of
the
S
protein
.

These
results
suggest
that
the
slower
viral
replication
and
the
ease
of
neutralization
seen
in
the
Ethiopian
MERS-CoV
are
due
to
strain-specific
differences
in
the
S
protein
and
may
account
for
the
absence
of
human
MERS-CoV
cases
in
Ethiopia
.

Metagenomics
poses
opportunities
for
clinical
and
public
health
virology
applications
by
offering
a
way
to
assess
complete
taxonomic
composition
of
a
clinical
sample
in
an
unbiased
way
.

However
,
the
techniques
required
are
complicated
and
analysis
standards
have
yet
to
develop
.

This
,
together
with
the
wealth
of
different
tools
and
workflows
that
have
been
proposed
,
poses
a
barrier
for
new
users
.

We
evaluated
49
published
computational
classification
workflows
for
virus
metagenomics
in
a
literature
review
.

To
this
end
,
we
described
the
methods
of
existing
workflows
by
breaking
them
up
into
five
general
steps
and
assessed
their
ease-of-use
and
validation
experiments
.

Performance
scores
of
previous
benchmarks
were
summarized
and
correlations
between
methods
and
performance
were
investigated
.

We
indicate
the
potential
suitability
of
the
different
workflows
for
(
1
)
time-constrained
diagnostics
,
(
2
)
surveillance
and
outbreak
source
tracing
,
(

)
detection
of
remote

)
,
and
(

biodiversity
studies
.

We
provide
two
decision
trees
for
virologists
to
help
select
a
workflow
for
medical
or
biodiversity
studies
,
as
well
as
directions
for
future
developments
in
clinical
viral
metagenomics
.

Activation
and
regulation
of
the
cascade
systems
of
the
blood
(
the
complement
system
,
the
coagulation/contact
activation/kallikrein
system
,
and
the
fibrinolytic
system
)
occurs
via
activation
of
zymogen
molecules
to
specific
active
proteolytic
enzymes
.

Despite
the
fact
that
the
generated
proteases
are
all
present
together
in
the
blood
,
under
physiological
conditions
,
the
activity
of
the
generated
proteases
is
controlled
by
endogenous
protease
inhibitors
.

Consequently
,
there
is
remarkable
little
crosstalk
between
the
different
systems
in
the
fluid
phase
.

This
concept
review
article
aims
at
identifying
and
describing
conditions
where
the
strict
system-related
control
is
circumvented
.

These
include
clinical
settings
where
massive
amounts
of
proteolytic
enzymes
are
released
from
tissues
,
e.g.
,
during
pancreatitis
or
post-traumatic
tissue
damage
,
resulting
in
consumption
of
the
natural
substrates
of
the
specific
proteases
and
the
available
protease
inhibitor
.

Another
example
of
cascade
system
dysregulation
is
disseminated
intravascular
coagulation
,
with
canonical
activation
of
all
cascade
systems
of
the
blood
,
also
leading
to
specific
substrate
and
protease
inhibitor
elimination
.

The
present
review
explains
basic
concepts
in
protease
biochemistry
of
importance
to
understand
clinical
conditions
with
extensive
protease
activation
.

Background
:
Bovine
rotavirus
(
BRV
)
infection
is
common
in
young
calves
.

This
viral
infection
causes
acute
diarrhea
leading
to
death
.

Rapid
identification
of
infected
calves
is
essential
to
control
BRV
successfully
.

Therefore
development
of
simple
,
highly
specific
,
and
sensitive
detection
method
for
BRV
is
needed
.

Results
:
A
reverse
transcription
loop-mediated
isothermal
amplification
(
RT-LAMP
)
assay
was
developed
and
optimized
for
rapid
detection
of
BRV
.

Specific
primer
sets
were
designed
to
target
the
sequences
of
the
VP6
gene
of
the
neonatal
calf
diarrhea
virus
(
NCDV
)
strain
of
BRV
.

The
RT-LAMP
assay
was
performed
in
a
water
bath
for
60
minutes
at
63°C
,
and
the
amplification
products
were
visualized
either
directly
or
under
ultraviolet
light
.

This
BRV
specific
RT-LAMP
assay
could
detect
3.32
copies
of
subtype
A
BRV
.

No
cross-reactions
were
detected
with
other
bovine
pathogens
.

The
ability
of
RT-LAMP
to
detect
bovine
rotavirus
was
further
evaluated
with
88
bovine
rectal
swab
samples
.

Twenty-nine
of
these
samples
were
found
to
be
positive
for
BRV
using
RT-LAMP
.

The
BRV-specific-RT-LAMP
results
were
also
confirmed
by
real-time
RT-PCR
assay
.

Conclusions
:
The
bovine
rotavirus-specific
RT-LAMP
assay
was
highly
sensitive
and
holds
promise
as
a
prompt
and
simple
diagnostic
method
for
the
detection
of
group
A
bovine
rotavirus
infection
in
young
calves
.

We
have
previously
isolated
several
IgG
rheumatoid
factors
(
RFs
)
from
patients
with
both
rheumatoid
arthritis
and
idiopathic
thrombocytopenia
purpura
using
phage
display
system
.

To
study
IgG
RFs
in
patients
with
other
autoimmune
diseases
,
phage
display
antibody
libraries
from
a
hepatitis
C
virus
infected
patient
with
Sjögren
's
syndrome
were
constructed
.

After
panning
,
a
specific
clone
RFL11
was
isolated
for
characterization
in
advance
.

The
binding
activity
and
specificity
of
RFL11
to
IgG
Fc
fragment
were
comparable
to
those
of
RFs
previously
isolated
.

The
analysis
with
existed
RF-Fc
complex
structures
indicated
the
homology
model
of
RFL11
is
similar
to
IgM
RF61
complex
with
high
binding
affinity
of
about
6
×
10
−8
M.
This
effect
resulted
from
longer
complementaritydetermining
region
(
CDR
)
combining
key
somatic
mutations
.

In
the
RFL11-Fc
interfaces
,
the
CDR-H3
loop
forms
a
finger-like
structure
extending
into
the
bottom
of
Fc
pocket
and
resulting
in
strong
ion
and
cation-pi
interactions
.

Moreover
,
a
process
of
antigen-driven
maturation
was
proven
by
somatically
mutated
VH
residues
on
H2
and
H3
CDR
loops
in
the
interfaces
.

Taken
together
,
these
results
suggested
that
high
affinity
IgG
RFs
can
be
generated
in
patients
with
Sjögren
's
syndrome
and
may
play
an
important
role
in
the
pathogenesis
of
this
autoimmune
disease
.

Background
:
The
spread
of
infectious
diseases
in
wildlife
populations
is
influenced
by
patterns
of
between-host
contacts
.

Habitat
``
hotspots
''
-places
attracting
a
large
numbers
of
individuals
or
social
groups
-can
significantly
alter
contact
patterns
and
,
hence
,
disease
propagation
.

Research
on
the
importance
of
habitat
hotspots
in
wildlife
epidemiology
has
primarily
focused
on
how
inter-individual
contacts
occurring
at
the
hotspot
itself
increase
disease
transmission
.

However
,
in
territorial
animals
,
epidemiologically
important
contacts
may
primarily
occur
as
animals
cross
through
territories
of
conspecifics
en
route
to
habitat
hotspots
.

So
far
,
the
phenomenon
has
received
little
attention
.

Here
,
we
investigate
the
importance
of
these
contacts
in
the
case
where
infectious
individuals
keep
visiting
the
hotspots
and
in
the
case
where
these
individuals
are
not
able
to

any
more
.

We
developed
a
simulation
epidemiological
model
to
investigate
both
cases
in
a
scenario
when
transmission
at
the
hotspot
does
not
occur
.

We
find
that
(
i
)
hotspots
still
exacerbate
epidemics
,
(
ii
)
when
infectious
individuals
do
not
travel
to
the
hotspot
,
the
most
vulnerable
individuals
are
those
residing
at
intermediate
distances
from
the
hotspot
rather
than
nearby
,
and
(
iii
)
the
epidemiological
vulnerability
of
a
population
is
the
highest
when
the
number
of
hotspots
is
intermediate
.

By
altering
animal
movements
in
their
vicinity
,
habitat
hotspots
can
thus
strongly
increase
the
spread
of
infectious
diseases
,
even
when
disease
transmission
does
not
occur
at
the
hotspot
itself
.

Interestingly
,
when
animals
only
visit
the
nearest
hotspot
,
creating
additional
artificial
hotspots
,
rather
than
reducing
their
number
,
may
be
an
efficient
disease
control
measure

Background
:
In
parts
of
India
,
Chandipura
Virus
(
CHPV
)
has
emerged
as
an
encephalitis
causing
pathogen
in
both
epidemic
and
sporadic
forms
.

This
pediatric
disease
follows
rapid
course
leading
to
55-75
%
mortality
.

In
the
absence
of
specific
treatment
,
effectiveness
of
RNA
interference
(
RNAi
)
was
evaluated
.

Methods
and
Findings
:
Efficacy
of
synthetic
short
interfering
RNA
(
siRNA
)
or
short
hairpin
RNA
(
shRNA
)
in
protecting
mice
from
CHPV
infection
was
assessed
.

The
target
genes
were
P
and
M
genes
primarily
because
important
role
of
the
former
in
viral
replication
and
lethal
nature
of
the
latter
.

Real
time
one
step
RT-PCR
and
plaque
assay
were
used
for
the
assessment
of
gene
silencing
.

Using
pAcGFP1N1-CHPV-P
,
we
showed
that
P-2
siRNA
was
most
efficient
in
reducing
the
expression
of
P
gene
in-vitro
.

Both
quantitative
assays
documented
2logs
reduction
in
the
virus
titer
when
P-2
,
M-5
or
M-6
siRNAs
were
transfected
2hr
post
infection
(
PI
)
.

Use
of
these
siRNAs
in
combination
did
not
result
in
enhanced
efficiency
.

P-2
siRNA
was
found
to
tolerate
four
mismatches
in
the
center
.

As
compared
to
five
different
shRNAs
,
P-2
siRNA
was
most
effective
in
inhibiting
CHPV
replication
.

An
extended
survival
was
noted
when
mice
infected
intracranially
with
100
LD
50
CHPV
were
treated
with
cationic
lipid
complexed
5
mg
P-2
siRNA
simultaneously
.

Infection
with
10LD
50
and
treatment
with
two
doses
of
siRNA
first
,
simultaneously
and
second
24
hr
PI
,
resulted
in
70
%
survival
.

Surviving
mice
showed
4logs
less
CHPV
titers
in
brain
without
histopathological
changes
or
antibody
response
.

Gene
expression
profiles
of
P-2
siRNA
treated
mice
showed
no
interferon
response
.

First
dose
of
siRNA
at
2hr
or
4hr
PI
with
second
dose
at
24hr
resulted
in
40
%
and
20
%
survival
respectively
suggesting
potential
application
in
therapy
.

Griffithsin
(
GRFT
)
is
a
red
alga-derived
lectin
with
demonstrated
broad
spectrum
antiviral
activity
against
enveloped
viruses
,
including
severe
acute
respiratory
syndrome-Coronavirus
(
SARS-CoV
)
,
Japanese

,

)
,
and
herpes

)
.

However
,
its
pharmacokinetic
profile
remains
largely
undefined
.

Here
,
Sprague
Dawley
rats
were
administered
a
single
dose
of
GRFT
at
10
or
20
mg/kg
by
intravenous
,
oral
,
and
subcutaneous
routes
,
respectively
,
and
serum
GRFT
levels
were
measured
at
select
time
points
.

In
addition
,
the
potential
for
systemic
accumulation
after
oral
dosing
was
assessed
in
rats
after
10
daily
treatments
with
GRFT
(
20
or
40
mg/kg
)
.

We
found
that
parenterally-administered
GRFT
in
rats
displayed
a
complex
elimination
profile
,
which
varied
according
to
administration
routes
.

However
,
GRFT
was
not
orally
bioavailable
,
even
after
chronic
treatment
.

Nonetheless
,
active
GRFT
capable
of
neutralizing
HIV-Env
pseudoviruses
was
detected
in
rat
fecal
extracts
after
chronic
oral
dosing
.

These
findings
support
further
evaluation
of
GRFT
for
pre-exposure
prophylaxis
against
emerging
epidemics
for
which
specific
therapeutics
are
not
available
,
including
systemic
and
enteric
infections
caused
by
susceptible
enveloped

.

In
addition
,
GRFT
should
be
considered
for
antiviral
therapy
and
the
prevention
of
rectal

Pneumonia
severity
index
(
PSI
)
is
an
important
scoring
system
that
can
assess
the
severity
of
community
acquired
pneumonia
and
determine
admission
status
.

However
,
there
is
a
lack
of
research
on
whether
this
scoring
system
can
be
applied
to
viral
community
acquired
pneumonia
.

The
purpose
of
this
study
was
to
evaluate
the
usefulness
of
PSI
in
viral
community
acquired
pneumonia
.

This
retrospective
cohort
study
included
1,434
adult
patients
(
aged
�18
years
)
who
were
admitted
to
the
emergency
department
of
a
university
hospital
during
2013-2015
because
of
community-acquired
pneumonia
.

Viral
infections
were
diagnosed
by
multiplex
PCR
.

Patients
diagnosed
with
non-viral
community-acquired
pneumonia
were
included
in
the
control
group
(
N
=
1,173
)
.

The
main
outcome
was
30-day
all-cause
mortality
.

multivariate
Cox
regression
analyses
were
performed
to
calculate
the
risk
of
death
.

Respiratory
viruses
were
detected
in
261
(
18.2
%
)
patients
with
community-acquired
pneumonia
.

Two
types
of
respiratory
viruses
were
detected
in
7
cases
.

Of
the
254
cases
detected
with
only

,
62
were

Mortality
was
not
significantly
different
between
patients
with
respiratory
virus
and
those
without
respiratory
virus
;
the
30day
all-cause
mortality
rates
were
20.3
%
and
22.4
%
,
respectively
(
P
=
0.45
)
.

Mortality
rate
increased
with
an
increasing
PSI
score
with
or
without
respiratory
viral
infection
.

Pulmonary
severity
index
was
significantly
associated
with
mortality

for
respiratory
virus
detection
(
hazard
ratio
=
1.024
,

.

Pneumonia
severity
index
score
is
an
important
factor
for
assessing
the
prognosis
of
patients

,
125
patients
(
100

.

Results
.

e
yield
of
the
BAL

.

e
yield
of

e
majority
of

had
concordant

.

Of
the
24
ICH
patients
who
had
a
positive

FARP
,
the
majority
(
79
%
)
had
the

pathogen
detected
from

NP
swab
.

Conclusion
.

e
FARP
may
be
useful
in
the
ICH
.

Given
the
high
concordance
,
in
patients
whom
a
pathogen
is
identified
on
the
NP
FARP
,
a
FARP
performed
on
BAL
will
likely
yield
the

result
.

However
,
if
the
NP
FARP
is
negative
,
performing
the
test
on
a

Porcine
reproductive
and
respiratory
syndrome
virus
(
PRRSV
)
is
one
of
the
most
economically
important
swine
pathogens
and
causes
reproductive
failure
in
sows
and
respiratory
disease
in
growing
pigs
.

PRRSV
mainly
infects
porcine
alveolar
macrophages
(
PAMs
)
,
leading
to
the
subversion
of
innate
and
adaptive
immunity
of
pigs
.

The
transcriptome
analysis
of
gene
expression
profiles
in
PRRSV-infected
PAMs
is
essential
for
understanding
the
pathogenesis
of
PRRSV
.

Here
we
performed
next-generation
RNA
sequencing
and
a
comprehensive
bioinformatics
analysis
to
characterize
the
dynamic
transcriptome
landscapes
in
PAMs
following
PRRSV
infection
.

Totally
38222
annotated
mRNAs

(
lncRNAs
)
,
and
17624
novel
lncRNAs
in
PRRSV-infected
PAMs
were
identified
through
a
transcripts
computational
identification
pipeline
.

The
differentially
expressed
mRNAs
and
lncRNAs
during
PRRSV
infection
were
characterized
.

Several
differentially
expressed
transcripts
were
validated
using
qRT-PCR
.

Analyses
on
dynamic
overrepresented
GO
terms
and
KEGG
pathways
in
PRRSV-infected
PAMs
at
different
time
points
were
performed
.

Meanwhile
the
genes
involved
in
IFN-related
signaling
pathways
,
proinflammatory
cytokines
and
chemokines
,
phagocytosis
,
and
antigen
presentation
and
processing
were
significantly
downregulated
,
indicating
the
aberrant
function
of
PAMs
during
PRRSV
infection
.

Moreover
,
the
differentially
and
highly
expressed
lncRNA
XR
297549.1
was
predicted
to
both
cis-regulate
and
trans-regulate
its
neighboring
gene
,
prostaglandin-endoperoxide
synthase
2
(
PTGS2
)
,
indicating
its
role
in
inflammatory
response
.

Our
findings
reveal
the
transcriptome
profiles
and
differentially
expressed
mRNAs
and
lncRNAs
in
PRRSV-infected
PAMs
in

,
providing
valuable
information
for

analysis
indicated
that
it
was
conserved
in
the
5′
and
3′-non-translated
regions
,
and
there
were
no
insertions
or
deletions
in
nonstructural
genes
,
such
as
ORF1a
,
ORF1b
,
ORF3a
,
ORF3b
,
and
ORF7
,
as
well
as
in
genes
encoding
structural
proteins
,
such
as
the
envelope
(
E
)
,
membrane
(
M
)
,
and
nucleoprotein
(
N
)
proteins
.

Furthermore
,
the
phylogenetic
analysis
indicated
that
the
TGEV-HX
strain
was
more
similar
to
the
TGEV
Purdue
cluster
than
to
the
Miller
cluster
.

Conclusions
:
The
present
study
described
the
isolation
and
genetic
characterization
of
a
TGEV-HX
strain
.

The
detailed
analysis
of
the
genetic
variation
of
TGEVs
in
China
provides
essential
information
for
further
understanding
the
evolution
of
TGEVs
.

Background
:
Study
of
drug-target
interaction
networks
is
an
important
topic
for
drug
development
.

It
is
both
timeconsuming
and
costly
to
determine
compound-protein
interactions
or
potential
drug-target
interactions
by
experiments
alone
.

As
a
complement
,
the
in
silico
prediction
methods
can
provide
us
with
very
useful
information
in
a
timely
manner
.

Methods/Principal
Findings
:
To
realize
this
,
drug
compounds
are
encoded
with
functional
groups
and
proteins
encoded
by
biological
features
including
biochemical
and
physicochemical
properties
.

The
optimal
feature
selection
procedures
are
adopted
by
means
of
the
mRMR
(
Maximum
Relevance
Minimum
Redundancy
)
method
.

Instead
of
classifying
the
proteins
as
a
whole
family
,
target
proteins
are
divided
into
four
groups
:
enzymes
,
ion
channels
,
G-protein-coupled
receptors
and
nuclear
receptors
.

Thus
,
four
independent
predictors
are
established
using
the
Nearest
Neighbor
algorithm
as
their
operation
engine
,
with
each
to
predict
the
interactions
between
drugs
and
one
of
the
four
protein
groups
.

As
a
result
,
the
overall
success
rates
by
the
jackknife
cross-validation
tests
achieved
with
the
four
predictors
are
85.48
%
,
80.78
%
,
78.49
%
,
and
85.66
%
,
respectively
.

Conclusion/Significance
:
Our
results
indicate
that
the
network
prediction
system
thus
established
is
quite
promising
and
encouraging
.

Background
:
Predicting
the
function
of
an
unknown
protein
is
an
essential
goal
in
bioinformatics
.

Sequence
similarity-based
approaches
are
widely
used
for
function
prediction
;
however
,
they
are
often
inadequate
in
the
absence
of
similar
sequences
or
when
the
sequence
similarity
among
known
protein
sequences
is
statistically
weak
.

This
study
aimed
to
develop
an
accurate
prediction
method
for
identifying
protein
function
,
irrespective
of
sequence
and
structural
similarities
.

A
highly
accurate
prediction
method
capable
of
identifying
protein
function
,
based
solely
on
protein
sequence
properties
,
is
described
.

This
method
analyses
and
identifies
specific
features
of
the
protein
sequence
that
are
highly
correlated
with
certain
protein
functions
and
determines
the
combination
of
protein
sequence
features
that
best
characterises
protein
function
.

Thirty-three
features
that
represent
subtle
differences
in
local
regions
and
full
regions
of
the
protein
sequences
were
introduced
.

On
the
basis
of
484
features
extracted
solely
from
the
protein
sequence
,
models
were
built
to
predict
the
functions
of
11
different
proteins
from
a
broad
range
of
cellular
components
,
molecular
functions
,
and
biological
processes
.

The
accuracy
of
protein
function
prediction
using
random
forests
with
feature
selection
ranged
from
94.23
%
to
100
%
.

The
local
sequence
information
was
found
to
have
a
broad
range
of
applicability
in
predicting
protein
function
.

We
present
an
accurate
prediction
method
using
a
machine-learning
approach
based
solely
on
protein
sequence
properties
.

The
primary
contribution
of
this
paper
is
to
propose
new
PNPRD
features
representing
global
and/or
local
differences
in
sequences
,
based
on
positively
and/
or
negatively
charged
residues
,
to
assist
in
predicting
protein
function
.

In
addition
,
we
identified
a
compact
and
useful
feature
subset
for
predicting
the
function
of
various
proteins
.

Our
results
indicate
that
sequence-based
classifiers
can
provide
good
results
among
a
broad
range
of
proteins
,
that
the
proposed
features
are
useful
in
predicting
several
functions
,
and
that
the
combination
of
our
and
traditional
features
may
support
the
creation
of
a
discriminative
feature
set
for
specific
protein
functions
.

As
one
of
many
nonstructural
proteins
of
porcine
reproductive
and
respiratory
syndrome
virus
(
PRRSV
)
,
nonstructural
protein
12
(
Nsp12
)
has
received
relatively
little
attention
,
and
its
role
in
virus
replication
,
if
any
,
is
essentially
unknown
.

By
the
application
of
reverse
genetic
manipulation
of
an
infectious
PRRSV
clone
,
the
current
study
is
the
first
to
demonstrate
that
Nsp12
is
a
key
component
of
PRRSV
replication
.

In
addition
,
the
biochemical
properties
of
Nsp12
were
evaluated
,
revealing
that
Nsp12
forms
dimers
when
exposed
to
oxidative
conditions
.

Furthermore
,
we
systemically
analyzed
the
function
of
Nsp12
in
PRRSV
RNA
synthesis
using
a
strand-specific
PCR
method
.

To
our
surprise
,
Nsp12
was
not
found
to
be
involved
in
minus-strand
genomic
RNA
(
-gRNA
)
synthesis
;
importantly
,
our
results
indicate
that
Nsp12
is
involved
in
the
synthesis
of
both
plus-and
minus-strand
subgenomic
mRNAs
(
+sgmRNA
and
-sgmRNA
)
.

Finally
,
we
found
that
the
combination
of
cysteine
35
and
cysteine
79
in
Nsp12
is
required
for
sgmRNA
synthesis
.

To
our
knowledge
,
we
are
the
first
to
report
the
biological
role
of
Nsp12
in
the
PRRSV
lifecycle
,
and
we
conclude
that
Nsp12
is
involved
in
the
synthesis
of
both
+
sgRNA
and
-sgRNA
.

Background
:
Since
rotavirus
is
one
of
the
leading
pathogens
that
cause
severe
gastroenteritis
and
represents
a
serious
threat
to
human
and
animal
health
,
researchers
have
been
searching
for
cheap
,
safe

effective
anti-rotaviral
drugs
.

There
is
a
widespread
of
interest
in
using
natural
products
as
antiviral
agents
,
and
among
them
,
licorice
derived
from
Glycyrrhiza
spp
.

has
exerted
antiviral
properties
against
several

.

In
this
study
,
anti-rotaviral
efficacy
of
Glycyrrhiza
uralensis
extract
(
GUE
)
as
an
effective
and
cheaper
remedy
without
side-effects
was
evaluated
in
colostrums-deprived
piglets
after
induction
of
rotavirus
diarrhea
.

Methods
:
Colostrums-deprived
piglets
were
inoculated
with

.

On
the
onset
of
diarrhea
,
piglets
were
treated
with
different
concentration
of
GUE
.

To
evaluate
the
antiviral
efficacy
of

.

Results
:
Among
the

(
100-400
mg/ml
)
administrated
to

Conclusions
:

.

Therapy
of

The
review
reports
a
short
biography
of
the
Italian
naturalized
chemist
Hugo
Schiff
and
an
outline
on
the
synthesis
and
use
of
his
most
popular
discovery
:
the
imines
,
very
well
known
and
popular
as
Schiff
Bases
.

Recent
developments
on
their
``
metallo-imines
''
variants
have
been
described
.

The
applications
of
Schiff
bases
in
organic
synthesis
as
partner
in
Staudinger
and
hetero
Diels-Alder
reactions
,
as
``
privileged
''
ligands
in
the
organometallic
complexes

active
Schiff
intermediates/targets
have
been
reported
as
well
.

and
healthy
controls
using
multiparametric
flow
cytometry
.

We
also
determined
by
polymerase
chain
reaction
(
PCR
)
the
presence
of
16
respiratory
viruses
.

Samples
were
collected
pre-HSCT
,
at
day
0
,
+10
,
+20
and
+30
after
HSCT
.

Peripheral
blood
(
PB
)
was
also
analyzed
to
determine
T
and
NK
cell
numbers
.

A
total
of
27
pediatric
HSCT
recipients
were
enrolled
and
16
of
them
had
at
least
one
viral
detection
(
60
%
)
.

Rhinovirus
was
the
most
frequent
pathogen
(
84
%
of
positive
NPAs
)
.

NPAs
of
patients
contained
fewer
T
and
NK
cells
compared
to
healthy
controls
(
p
=
0.0132
and
p
=
0.120
,
respectively
)
.

Viral
pcR
+
patients
showed
higher
NK
cell
number
in
their
NPAs
.

The
activating
receptors
repertoire
expressed
by
NK
cells
was
also
higher
in
NPA
samples
,
especially
NKp44
and
NKp46
.

Our
study
supports
nK
cells
relevance
for
the
immune
defense
against
respiratory
viruses
in
HSct
recipients
.

To
analyze
pathogenic
species
in
bats
from
southeast
coastal
regions
of
China
,
we
performed
metagenomic
sequencing
technology
for
high
throughput
sequencing
of
six
sentinels
from
southeast
coastal
area
of
China
.

We
obtained
5,990,261
high
quality
reads
from
intestine
and
lung
tissue
of
235
bats
,
including
2,975,371
assembled
sequences
.

631,490
reads
predicted
overlapping
sequences
for
the
open
reading
frame
(
ORF
)
,
which
accounts
for
2.37
%
of
all
the
sequences
(
15,012/631,490
)
.

Further
,
the
acquired
virus
sequences
were
classified
into
25
viral
families
,
including
16
vertebrate
viruses
,
four
plant
viruses
and
five
insect
viruses
.

All
bat
samples
were
screened
by
specific
PCR
and
phylogenetic
analysis
.

Using
these
techniques
,
we
discovered
many
novel
bat
viruses
and
some
bat
viruses
closelyrelated
to
known
human/animal
pathogens
,
including
coronavirus
,
norovirus
,
adenovirus
,
bocavirus
,
astrovirus
,
and
circovirus
.

In
summary
,
this
study
extended
our
understanding
of
bats
as
the
viral
reservoirs
.

Additionally
,
it
also
provides
a
basis
for
furher
studying
the
transmission
of
viruses
from
bats
to
humans
.

Bats
belong
to
the
order
Chiroptera
,
and
are
the
second
largest
order
of
mammals
after
rodents
.

This
order
includes
19
families
and
962
species
distributed
across
the
globe
1
.

More
than
130
kinds
of
viruses
have
been
detected
in
bats
,
including
more
than
60
species
of
zoonotic
viruses
which
are
highly
pathogenic
in
humans
2
,
such
as
severe
acute
respiratory
syndrome
(
SARS
)
-like
coronavirus
(
SL-CoV
)
,
Ebola
virus
,
Nipah
virus
,
and
Hendra
virus
3-6
.

In
2002
,
SARS
outbreak
in
China
infected
more
than
8,000
people
worldwide
and
killed
at
least
800
people
.

Chinese
horseshoe
bats
were
proved
to
be
the
natural
reservoirs
of
SARS-CoV
and
that
intermediate
hosts
may
not
be
necessary
for
direct
human
infection
by
a
bat
hosting
SL-CoV
7
.

Similarly
,
Middle
East
respiratory
syndrome
(
MERS
)
-associated
coronavirus
were
detected
in
bats
,
and
required
dipeptidyl
peptidase
4
cell
receptors
for
its
invasion
into
host
cells
8
.

It
seems
likely
that
bats
might
act
as
natural
hosts
which
critical
roles
in
viral
iner-host
transmission
.

In
the
last
five
years
,
the
use
of
second-generation
sequence
technology
allowed
us
to
elucidate
a
flood
of
viruses
,
like
SARS-CoV
,
hepatitis
B
virus
,
rotavirus
and
other
important
viruses
9-11
.

In
2010
,
meta-genomic
analysis
was
conducted
for
the
first
time
,
following
the
second
generation
sequencing
of
oral
swab
and
faecal
samples
from
41
bats
of
three
common
North
American
bat
species
.

The
results
showed
that
sample
pools
contained
strong
matches
to
at
least
three
novel
group
of
CoVs
,
and
large
numbers
of
insect
and
plant
virus

Co-infection
by
multiple
parasites
is
common
within
individuals
.

Interactions
between
co-infecting
parasites
include
resource
competition
,
direct
competition
and
immune-mediated
interactions
and
each
are
likely
to
alter
the
dynamics
of
single
parasites
.

We
posit
that
co-infection
is
a
driver
of
variation
in
parasite
establishment
and
growth
,
ultimately
altering
the
production
of
parasite
transmission
stages
.

To
test
this
hypothesis
,
three
different
treatment
groups
of
laboratory
mice
were
infected
with
the
gastrointestinal
helminth
Heligmosomoides
polygyrus
,
the
respiratory
bacterial
pathogen
Bordetella
bronchiseptica
lux
þ
or
co-infected
with
both
parasites
.

To
follow
co-infection
simultaneously
,
self-bioluminescent
bacteria
were
used
to
quantify
infection
in
vivo
and
in
real-time
,
while
helminth
egg
production
was
monitored
in
real-time
using
faecal
samples
.

Co-infection
resulted
in
high
bacterial
loads
early
in
the
infection
(
within
the
first
5
days
)
that
could
cause
host
mortality
.

Co-infection
also
produced
helminth
'super-shedders
'
;
individuals
that
chronically
shed
the
helminth
eggs
in
larger
than
average
numbers
.

Our
study
shows
that
co-infection
may
be
one
of
the
underlying
mechanisms
for
the
often-observed
high
variance
in
parasite
load
and
shedding
rates
,
and
should
thus
be
taken
into
consideration
for
disease
management
and
control
.

Further
,
using
self-bioluminescent
bacterial
reporters
allowed
quantification
of
the
progression
of
infection
within
the
whole
animal
of
the
same
individuals
at
a
fine
temporal
scale
(
daily
)
and
significantly
reduced
the
number
of
animals
used
(
by
85
%
)
compared
with
experiments
that
do
not
use
in
vivo
techniques
.

Thus
,
we
present
bioluminescent
imaging
as
a
novel
,
non-invasive
tool
offering
great
potential
to
be
taken
forward
into
other
applications
of

CEACAM1
is
a
multifunctional
Ig-like
cell

molecule
expressed
by

.

CEACAM1-4L
and
CEACAM1-4S
,
two
isoforms
produced
by
differential
splicing
,
are
predominant
in
rat
liver
.

Previous
work
has
shown
that
downregulation
of
both
isoforms
occurs
in
rat
hepatocellular
carcinomas
.

Here
,
we
have
isolated
an
anchorage
dependent
clone
,
designated
253T-NT
that
does
not
express
detectable
levels
of
CEACAM1
.

Stable
transfection
of
253-NT
cells
with
a
wild
type
CEACAM1-4S
expression
vector
induced
an
anchorage
independent
growth
in
vitro
and
a
tumorigenic
phenotype
in
vivo
.

These
phenotypes
were
used
as
quantifiable
end
points
to
examine
the
functionality
of
the
CEACAM1-4S
transmembrane
domain
.

Examination
of
the
CEACAM1
transmembrane
domain
showed
N-terminal
GXXXG
dimerization
sequences
and
C-terminal
tyrosine
residues
shown
in
related
studies
to
stabilize
transmembrane
domain
helix-helix
interactions
.

To
examine
the
effects
of
transmembrane
domain
mutations
,
253-NT
cells
were
transfected
with
transmembrane
domain
mutants
carrying
glycine
to
leucine
or
tyrosine
to
valine
substitutions
.

Results
showed
that
mutation
of
transmembrane
tyrosine
residues
greatly
enhanced
growth
in
vitro
and
in
vivo
.

Mutation
of
transmembrane
dimerization
motifs
,
in
contrast
,
significantly
reduced
anchorage
independent
growth
and
tumorigenicity
.

253-NT
cells
expressing
CEACAM1-4S
with
both
glycine
to
leucine
and
tyrosine
to
valine
mutations
displayed
the
growth-enhanced
phenotype
of
tyrosine
mutants
.

The
dramatic
effect
of
transmembrane
domain
mutations
constitutes
strong
evidence
that
the
transmembrane
domain
is
an
important
determinant
of
CEACAM1-4S
functionality
and
most
likely
by
other
proteins
with
transmembrane
domains
containing
dimerization
sequences
and/or
C-terminal
tyrosine
residues

Cryo-electron

for

a
technique

a
fast
development

the

allowed
that
a

that
their

the
structures

routinely
done

Methods

An

However

The

diverse
intracellular

interacting
with
ubiquitously

the
Exchange

EPAC
is
implicated
in
multiple
pathologies

several

been
identified
in
recent
years

However
,
the
mechanisms
and
molecular
interactions
underlying
the
EPAC
inhibition
elicited
by
such
compounds
are
still
poorly
understood
.

Additionally
,
being
hydrophobic
low
molecular
weight

,
EPAC-specific
inhibitors
are
prone
to
forming
colloidal
aggregates
,
which
result
in
non-specific
aggregation-based
inhibition

in
aqueous

Here
,
we
review
from
a
biophysical
perspective
the
molecular
basis
of
the
specific
and
non-specific
interactions
of
two
EPAC

a
non-competitive
inhibitor
,
and
ESI-09
,
a
competitive
inhibitor
of
EPAC

Additionally
,
we
discuss
the
value
of
common
ABI
attenuators
(
e.g.

to
reduce
false

at
the
expense
of
introducing
false

screening
aggregation-prone

We
hope
this

provides
the
EPAC
community
effective
criteria
to

The
new

,
now
known
as
the
exchange
protein
directly
activated
by
cAMP
(
EPAC
)
,
was
then
identified
through
a
database

for
putative
cAMP-binding
domains

.

There
are
two
isoforms
of

)
that
serve
as

factors
for
Ras-like
GTPases
,
primarily
Rap1
and

16

.

EPAC1
is
more
broadly
expressed
,
e.g.

in
the
circulatory

For
further
details
about
the
physiological
role
of
EPAC
and
subsequent
disease
implications
,
we
refer
to
excellent
reviews

Given
the
critical
role
played
by
EPAC
in
multiple
pathologies
,
several
EPAC-specific
modulators
have
been
screened
to
target
EPAC
proteins
(
vide
infra
)
.

Despite
their
wide
commercial
availability
and
seemingly
ubiquitous
use
in
experimental
studies
,
for
several
EPAC
inhibitors
,
the
molecular
basis
of
their
interactions
with
EPAC
and
the
related
mechanism
of
action
are
currently
not
fully
understood
,
thus
limiting
further
improvement
on
existing
inhibitor
design
,
lead
optimization
and
EPAC-targeted
drug
development
.

Another
notable
impediment
in
drug
discovery
and
development
[
34
,
35
]
arises
from
the
hydrophobic
nature
of
the
aforementioned
EPAC
inhibitors
,
which
makes
them
susceptible
to
the
formation
of
colloidal
aggregates
in
a
hydrophilic
environment
.

These
aggregation
prone-compounds
can
modulate
specific
enzyme-substrate
interactions
due
to
non-specific
enzyme-aggregate
absorption
,
ultimately
modifying
enzyme
activity
due
to
protein
misfolding/unfolding
,
decrease
in
free
substrate
concentration
,
alteration
of
effective
enzyme-substrate
affinity
and/or
physical
separation
of
the
enzyme
and
substrate
[
34

[
35
]
[
36
]
.

Overall
,
the
phenomenon
of
non-specific
enzyme
inhibition
is
typically
referred
to
as
aggregation-prone
inhibition
(
ABI
)
and
is
notorious
for
introducing
false
positives
in
drug
screens
[
34
,
37
]
as
well
as
posing
several
challenges
in
terms
of
dosage
optimization
and
drug
delivery
in
physiological
systems
.

Many
of
the
aforementioned
EPAC
inhibitors
have
shown
great
therapeutic
potential
in
cell-based
and
in
vivo
models
despite
their
propensity
to
form
colloidal
aggregates
[
38
]
[
39
]
[
40
]
[
41
]
.

Interestingly
,
several
drug-like
small
molecules
,
lead
compounds
and
even
marketed
drugs
show
aggregation-prone
tendencies
,
particularly
at
micromolar
concentrations
[
42
]
,
raising
the
question
of
how
the
specific
interactions
between
enzymes
and
enzyme-specific
inhibitors
are
affected
by
the
latter
's
aggregation-prone
tendencies
.

Moreover
,
it
has
not
been
conclusively
determined
if
all
ligand-aggregates
involved
in
ABI
bind
enzymes
in
the
first
place
.

Thus
,
a
comprehensive
understanding
of
the
mechanism
of
ABI
as
well
as
the
underlying
specific
enzyme
:
inhibitor
interactions
is
critical
to
further
optimize
EPAC
inhibitors
.

As
ABI
is
ubiquitous
,
several
strategies
have
been
implemented
to
counter
aggregate
formation
,
mainly
exploiting
the
sensitivity
of
ligand
aggregates
to
non-ionic
detergents
and
other
solubilizing
agents
[
37
,
43
]
.

As
such
,
the
detergent
Triton
X100
(
TX
)
and
human
or
bovine
serum
albumin
(
HSA
or
BSA
)
are
commonly
used
to
attenuate
false
positives
associated
with
ABI
in
drug
screens
.

However
,
they
introduce
the
added
risk
of
generating
false
negatives
[
34
,
44
]
.

Therefore
,
in
addition
to
understanding
the
basis
of
ABI
when
evaluating
the
therapeutic
potential
of
EPAC-specific
inhibitors
(
ESIs
)
,
if
attenuators
are
used
,
awareness
of
the
mechanism
of
ABI
attenuation
is
also
crucial
to
carefully
define
and
consider
the
false
positive
vs.
false
negative
balance

is
an
important
target
in
antiviral
studies
.

Here
,
we
report
a
crystal
structure
of
EV71
3D
pol
elongation
complex
(
EC
)
at
1.8Å
resolution
.

The
structure
reveals
that
the
5end
guanosine
of
the
downstream
RNA
template
interacts
with
a
fingers
domain
pocket
,
with
the
base
sandwiched
by
H44
and
R277
side
chains
through
hydrophobic
stacking
interactions
,
and
these
interactions
are
still
maintained
after
one
in-crystal
translocation
event
induced
by
nucleotide
incorporation
,
implying
that
the
pocket
could
regulate
the
functional
properties
of
the
polymerase
by
interacting
with
RNA
.

When
mutated
,
residue
R277
showed
an
impact
on
virus
proliferation
in
virological
studies
with
residue
H44
having
a
synergistic
effect
.

In
vitro
biochemical
data
further
suggest
that
mutations
at
these
two
sites
affect
RNA
binding
,
EC
stability
,
but
not
polymerase
catalytic
rate
(
k
cat
)
and
apparent
NTP
affinity
(
K
M
,
NTP
)
.

We
propose
that
,
although
rarely
captured
by
crystallography
,
similar
surface
pocket
interaction
with
nucleobase
may
commonly
exist
in
nucleic
acid
motor
enzymes
to
facilitate
their
processivity
.

Potential
applications
in
antiviral
drug
and
vaccine
development
are
also
discussed
.

A
shortcoming
of
most
correlation
distance
methods
based
on
the
composition
vectors
without
alignment
developed
for
phylogenetic
analysis
using
complete
genomes
is
that
the
``
distances
''
are
not
proper
distance
metrics
in
the
strict
mathematical
sense
.

In
this
paper
we
propose
two
new
correlation-related
distance
metrics
to
replace
the
old
one
in
our
dynamical
language
approach
.

Four
genome
datasets
are
employed
to
evaluate
the
effects
of
this
replacement
from
a
biological
point
of
view
.

We
find
that
the
two
proper
distance
metrics
yield
trees
with
the
same
or
similar
topologies
as/to
those
using
the
old
``
distance
''
and
agree
with
the
tree
of
life
based
on
16S
rRNA
in
a
majority
of
the
basic
branches
.

Hence
the
two
proper
correlation-related
distance
metrics
proposed
here
improve
our
dynamical
language
approach
for
phylogenetic
analysis
.

Background
:
Recognizing
the
importance
of
having
a
broad
exploration
of
how
cultural
perspectives
may
shape
thinking
about
ethical
considerations
,
the
Centers
for
Disease
Control
and
Prevention
(
CDC
)
funded
four
regional
meetings
in
Africa
,
Asia
,
Latin
America
,
and
the
Eastern
Mediterranean
to
explore
these
perspectives
relevant
to
pandemic
influenza
preparedness
and
response
.

The
meetings
were
attended
by
168
health
professionals
,
scientists
,
academics
,
ethicists
,
religious
leaders
,
and
other
community
members
representing
40
countries
in
these
regions
.

Methods
:
We
reviewed
the
meeting
reports
,
notes
and
stories
and
mapped
outcomes
to
the
key
ethical
challenges
for
pandemic
influenza
response
described
in
the
World
Health
Organization
's
(
WHO
's
)
guidance
,
Ethical
Considerations
in
Developing
a
Public
Health
Response
to
Pandemic
Influenza
:
transparency
and
public
engagement
,
allocation
of
resources
,
social
distancing
,
obligations
to
and
of
healthcare
workers
,
and
international
collaboration
.

Results
:
The
important
role
of
transparency
and
public
engagement
were
widely
accepted
among
participants
.

However
,
there
was
general
agreement
that
no
``
one
size
fits
all
''
approach
to
allocating
resources
can
address
the
variety
of
economic
,
cultural
and
other
contextual
factors
that
must
be
taken
into
account
.

The
importance
of
social
distancing
as
a
tool
to
limit
disease
transmission
was
also
recognized
,
but
the
difficulties
associated
with
this
measure
were
acknowledged
.

There
was
agreement
that
healthcare
workers
often
have
competing
obligations
and
that
government
has
a
responsibility
to
assist
healthcare
workers
in
doing
their
job
by
providing
appropriate
training
and
equipment
.

Finally
,
there
was
agreement
about
the
importance
of
international
collaboration
for
combating
global
health
threats
.

Conclusion
:
Although
some
cultural
differences
in
the
values
that
frame
pandemic
preparedness
and
response
efforts
were
observed
,
participants
generally
agreed
on
the
key
ethical
principles
discussed
in
the
WHO
's
guidance
.

Most
significantly
the
input
gathered
from
these
regional
meetings
pointed
to
the
important
role
that
procedural
ethics
can
play
in
bringing
people
and
countries
together
to
respond
to
the
shared
health
threat
posed
by
a
pandemic
influenza
despite
the
existence
of
cultural
differences
.

The
procedural
values
of
transparency
and
inclusiveness
are
widely
accepted
and
crucial
for
ethical
decision-making
.

but
engaging
with

can
help
both
to
discover
these
factors
and
to
get
buy
in
.

•
Although
meeting
participants
acknowledged
the
importance
of
social
distancing
as
a
tool
to
limit
disease

,
they
also
recognized
the
difficulties
associated
with
this

.

•
Healthcare
workers
often
have
competing
obligations
that
can
compromise
their
ability
to
fulfill
public
health
duties
during
an
emergency

a
responsibility

their
job

Although
international
collaboration
can
be
difficult
,
focusing
on
shared
values
and
fair
procedures
(
procedural
ethics
)
can
bring
countries
together
to
combat
the
common
health
threat
that
global
pandemics
pose
.

Recognizing
that
cultural
perspectives
may
shape
the
ethical
context
of
an
emergency
response
,
the
Centers
for
Disease

Prevention
(

funded
four
regional
meetings
to
explore
cultural
perspectives
relevant
to
pandemic
influenza
preparedness
and
response
.

Although
regional
cultural
differences
were
observed
,
these
differences
will
not
prevent
countries
from
coming
together
to
collectively
address
a
shared
existential
health
threat
.

Pandemics
create
a
global
predicament
that
can
unite
countries
around
the
shared
value
of
health
,
rather
than

Circular
RNAs
(
circRNAs
)
are
an
integral
component
of
the
host
competitive
endogenous
RNA
(
ceRNA
)
network
.

These
noncoding
RNAs
are
characterized
by
their
unique
splicing
reactions
to
form
covalently
closed
loop
structures
and
play
important
RNA
regulatory
roles
in
cells
.

Recent
studies
showed
that
circRNA
expressions
were
perturbed
in
viral
infections
and
circRNAs
might
serve
as
potential
antiviral
targets
.

We
investigated
the
host
ceRNA
network
changes
and
biological
relevance
of
circRNAs
in
human
lung
adenocarcinoma
epithelial
(
Calu-3
)
cells
infected
with
the
highly
pathogenic
Middle
East
respiratory
syndrome
coronavirus
(
MERS-CoV
)
.

A
total
of
≥49337
putative
circRNAs
were
predicted
.

Among
the
7845
genes
which
generated
putative
circRNAs
,
147
(
1.9
%
)
of
them
each
generated
≥30
putative
circRNAs
and
were
involved
in
various
biological
,
cellular
,
and
metabolic
processes
,
including
viral
infections
.

Differential
expression
(
DE
)
analysis
showed
that
the
proportion
of
DE
circRNAs
significantly
(
P
<
0.001
)
increased
at
24
h-post
infection
.

These
DE
circRNAs
were
clustered
into
4
groups
according
to
their
time-course
expression
patterns
and
demonstrated
inter-cluster
and
intracluster
variations
in
the
predicted
functions
of
their
host
genes
.

Our
comprehensive
circRNA-miRNA-mRNA
network
identified
7
key
DE
circRNAs
involved
in
various
biological
processes
upon
MERS-CoV
infection
.

Specific
siRNA
knockdown
of
two
selected
DE
circRNAs
(
circFNDC3B
and
circCNOT1
)
significantly
reduced
MERS-CoV
load
and
their
target
mRNA
expression
which
modulates
various
biological
pathways
,
including
the
mitogen-activated
protein
kinase
(
MAPK
)
and
ubiquitination
pathways
.

These
results
provided
novel
insights
into
the
ceRNA
network
perturbations
,
biological
relevance
of
circRNAs
,
and
potential
host-targeting
antiviral
strategies
for
MERS-CoV
infection
.

Acute
asthma
exacerbations
and
pneumonia
are
important
causes
of
morbidity
and
mortality
in
children
and
may
coexist
in
the
same
children
,
although
symptom
overlap
may
lead
to
difficulties
in
diagnosis
.

Microbial
and
viral
diversity
and
differential
abundance
of
either
may
play
an
important
role
in
infection
susceptibility
and
the
development
of
acute
and
chronic
respiratory
diseases
.

Background
:
Mosquito-borne
infectious
diseases
pose
a
severe
threat
to
public
health
in
many
areas
of
the
world
.

Current
methods
for
pathogen
detection
and
surveillance
are
usually
dependent
on
prior
knowledge
of
the
etiologic
agents
involved
.

Hence
,
efficient
approaches
are
required
for
screening
wild
mosquito
populations
to
detect
known
and
unknown
pathogens
.

Methodology/principal
findings
:
In
this
study
,
we
explored
the
use
of
Next
Generation
Sequencing
to
identify
viral
agents
in
wild-caught
mosquitoes
.

We
extracted
total
RNA
from
different
mosquito
species
from
South
China
.

Small
18-30
bp
length
RNA
molecules
were
purified
,
reverse-transcribed
into
cDNA
and
sequenced
using
Illumina
GAIIx
instrumentation
.

Bioinformatic
analyses
to
identify
putative
viral
agents
were
conducted
and
the
results
confirmed
by
PCR
.

We
identified
a
non-enveloped
single-stranded
DNA
densovirus
in
the
wild-caught
Culex
pipiens
molestus
mosquitoes
.

The
majority
of
the
viral
transcripts
(
..80
%
of
the
region
)
were
covered
by
the
small
viral
RNAs
,
with
a
few
peaks
of
very
high
coverage
obtained
.

The
+/2
strand
sequence
ratio
of
the
small
RNAs
was
approximately
7:1
,
indicating
that
the
molecules
were
mainly
derived
from
the
viral
RNA
transcripts
.

The
small
viral
RNAs
overlapped
,
enabling
contig
assembly
of
the
viral
genome
sequence
.

We
identified
some
small
RNAs
in
the
reverse
repeat
regions
of
the
viral
59-and
39
-untranslated
regions
where
no
transcripts
were
expected
.

Conclusions/significance
:
Our
results
demonstrate
for
the
first
time
that
high
throughput
sequencing
of
small
RNA
is
feasible
for
identifying
viral
agents
in
wild-caught
mosquitoes
.

Our
results
show
that
it
is
possible
to
detect
DNA
viruses
by
sequencing
the
small
RNAs
obtained
from
insects
,
although
the
underlying
mechanism
of
small
viral
RNA
biogenesis
is
unclear
.

Our
data
and
those
of
other
researchers
show
that
high
throughput
small
RNA
sequencing
can
be
used
for
pathogen
surveillance
in
wild
mosquito
vectors
.

The
phosphorylation
of

Results
:

results
in
activation

Conclusion
:
MNV1
manipulates
the
host

machinery
by
controlling
eIF4E
activity
.

Significance
:
Regulation
of
cellular

been
reported
in
É
quateur
Province
,
Democratic

.

We
used
reported

prior
outbreaks
to
estimate
the
total
outbreak
size

with

use
.

We
modeled
Ebola
virus
transmission
using
a
stochastic
branching
process
model
that
included
reproduction
numbers
from
past
Ebola
outbreaks
and
a
particle
filtering
method
to
generate
a
probabilistic
projection
of
the
outbreak
size
and
duration
conditioned
on
its
reported
trajectory
to
date
;
modeled
using
high

,
and

)
estimates
of
vaccination
coverage
(
after

)
.

Additionally
,
we
used
the
time
series
for
18
prior
Ebola
outbreaks
from
1976
to
2016
to
parameterize
the
Thiel-Sen
regression
model
predicting
the
outbreak
size
from
the
number
of
observed
cases
from
April
4
to
May
27
.

We
used
these
techniques
on
probable
and
confirmed
case
counts
with
and
without
inclusion
of
suspected

.

Probabilistic
projections
were
scored
against
the
actual
outbreak
size
of
54

With

Important
progress
in
understanding
replication
,
interactions
with
host
plants
,
and
evolution
of
closteroviruses
enabled
engineering
of
several
vectors
for
gene
expression
and
virus-induced
gene
silencing
.

Due
to
the
broad
host
range
of
closteroviruses
,
these
vectors
expanded
vector
applicability
to
include
important
woody
plants
such
as
citrus
and
grapevine
.

Furthermore
,
large
closterovirus
genomes
offer
genetic
capacity
and
stability
unrivaled
by
other
plant
viral
vectors
.

These
features
provided
immense
opportunities
for
using
closterovirus
vectors
for
the
functional
genomics
studies
and
pathogen
control
in
economically
valuable
crops
.

This
review
briefly
summarizes
advances
in
closterovirus
research
during
the
last
decade
,
explores
the
relationships
between
virus
biology
and
vector
design
,
and
outlines
the
most
promising
directions
for
future
application
of
closterovirus
vectors
.

In
recent
years
,
the
use
of
in-feed
antibiotics
for
growth
and
disease
prevention
in
livestock
production
has
been
under
severe
scrutiny
.

The
use
and
misuse
of
in-feed
antibiotics
has
led
to
problems
with
drug
residues
in
animal
products
and
increased
bacterial
resistance
.

Chicken
egg
yolk
antibodies
(
IgY
)
have
attracted
considerable
attention
as
an
alternative
to
antibiotics
to
maintain
swine
health
and
performance
.

Oral
administration
of
IgY
possesses
many
advantages
over
mammalian
IgG
such
as
cost-effectiveness
,
convenience
and
high
yield
.

This
review
presents
an
overview
of
the
potential
to
use
IgY
immunotherapy
for
the
prevention
and
treatment
of
swine
diarrhea
diseases
and
speculates
on
the
future
of
IgY
technology
.

Included
are
a
review
of
the
potential
applications
of
IgY
in
the
control
of
enteric
infections
of
either
bacterial
or
viral
origin
such
as
enterotoxigenic
Escherichia
coli
,
Salmonella
spp.
,
rotavirus
,
porcine
transmissible
gastroenteritis
virus
,
and
porcine

.

Some
potential
obstacles
to
the
adoption
of

Background
:
China
has
transitioned
from
being
one
of
the
fastest-growing
populations
to
among
the
most
rapidly
aging
countries
worldwide
.

In
particular
,
the
population
of
oldest-old
individuals
,
those
aged
80+
,
is
projected
to
quadruple
by
2050
.

The
oldest-old
represent
a
uniquely
important
group-they
have
high
demand
for
personal
assistance
and
the
highest
healthcare
costs
of
any
age
group
.

Understanding
trends
in
disability
and
longevity
among
the
oldest-old-that
is
,
whether
successive
generations
are
living
longer
and
with
less
disability-is
of
great
importance
for
policy
and
planning
purposes
.

We
utilized
data
from
successive
birth
cohorts
(
n
=
20,520
)
of
the
Chinese
oldest-old
born
10
years
apart
(
the
earlier
cohort
was
interviewed
in
1998
and
the
later
cohort
in
2008
)
.

Disability
was
defined
as
needing
personal
assistance
in
performing
one
or
more
of
five
essential
activities
(
bathing
,
transferring
,
dressing
,
eating
,
and
toileting
)
or
being
incontinent
.

Participants
were
followed
for
age-specific
disability
transitions
and
mortality
(
in
2000
and
2002
for
the
earlier
cohort
and
2011
and
2014
for
the
later
cohort
)
,
which
were
then
used
to
generate
microsimulation-based
multistate
life
tables
to
estimate
partial
life
expectancy
(
LE
)
and
disability-free
LE
(
DFLE
)
,
stratified
by
sex
and
age
groups
(
octogenarians
,
nonagenarians
,
and
centenarians
)
.

We
additionally
explored
sociodemographic
heterogeneity
in
LE
and
DFLE
by
urban/rural
residence
and
educational
attainment
.

Results
:
More
recently
born
Chinese
octogenarians
(
born
1919-1928
)
had
a
longer
partial
LE
between
ages
80
and
89
than
octogenarians
born
1909-1918
,
and
octogenarian
women
experienced
an
increase
in
partial
DFLE
of
0.32
years
(
P
=
0.004
)
across
the
two
birth
cohorts
.

Although
no
increases
in
partial
LE
were
observed
among
nonagenarians
or
centenarians
,
partial
DFLE
increased
across
birth
cohorts
,
with
a
gain
of
0.41
years
(
P
<
0.001
)
among
nonagenarians
and
0.07
years
(
P
=
0.050
)
among
centenarians
.

Subgroup
analyses
revealed
that
gains
in
partial
LE
and
DFLE
primarily
occurred
among
the
urban
resident
population
.

Conclusions
:
Successive
generations
of
China
's
oldest-old
are
living
with
less
disability
as
a
whole
,
and
LE
is
expanding
among
octogenarians
.

However
,
we
found
a
widening
urban-rural
disparity
in
longevity
and
disability
,
highlighting
the
need
to
improve
policies
to
alleviate
health
inequality
throughout
the
population
.

Background
:
Neurotropic
flaviviruses
such
as
tick-borne
encephalitis
virus
(
TBEV
)
,
Japanese
encephalitis
virus
(
JEV
)
,
West
Nile
virus
(
WNV
)
,
and
Zika
virus
(
ZIKV
)
are
causative
agents
of
severe
brain-related
diseases
including
meningitis
,
encephalitis
,
and
microcephaly
.

We
have
previously
shown
that
local
type
I
interferon
response
within
the
central
nervous
system
(
CNS
)
is
involved
in
the
protection
of
mice
against
tick-borne
flavivirus
infection
.

However
,
the
cells
responsible
for
mounting
this
protective
response
are
not
defined
.

Methods
:
Primary
astrocytes
were
isolated
from
wild-type
(
WT
)
and
interferon
alpha
receptor
knock
out
(
IFNAR
−/−
)
mice
and
infected
with
neurotropic
flaviviruses
.

Viral
replication
and
spread
,
IFN
induction
and
response
,
and
cellular
viability
were
analyzed
.

Transcriptional
levels
in
primary
astrocytes
treated
with
interferon
or
supernatant
from
virus-infected
cells
were
analyzed
by
RNA
sequencing
and
evaluated
by
different
bioinformatics
tools
.

Results
:
Here
,
we
show
that
astrocytes
control
viral
replication
of
different
TBEV
strains
,
JEV
,
WNV
,
and
ZIKV
.

In
contrast
to
fibroblast
,
astrocytes
mount
a
rapid
interferon
response
and
restrict
viral
spread
.

Furthermore
,
basal
expression
levels
of
key
interferon-stimulated
genes
are
high
in
astrocytes
compared
to
mouse
embryonic
fibroblasts
.

Bioinformatic
analysis
of
RNA-sequencing
data
reveals
that
astrocytes
have
established
a
basal
antiviral
state
which
contributes
to
the
rapid
viral
recognition
and
upregulation
of
interferons
.

The
most
highly
upregulated
pathways
in
neighboring
cells
were
linked
to
type
I
interferon
response
and
innate
immunity
.

The
restriction
in
viral
growth
was
dependent
on
interferon
signaling
,
since
loss
of
the
interferon
receptor
,
or
its
blockade
in
wild-type
cells
,
resulted
in
high
viral
replication
and
virus-induced
cytopathic
effects
.

Astrocyte
supernatant
from
TBEV-infected
cells
can
restrict
TBEV
growth
in
astrocytes
already
6
h
post
infection
,
the
effect
on
neurons
is
highly
reinforced
,
and
astrocyte
supernatant
from
3
h
post
infection
is
already
protective
.

Conclusions
:
These
findings
suggest
that
the
combination
of
an
intrinsic
constitutive
antiviral
response
and
the
fast
induction
of
type
I
IFN
production
by
astrocytes
play
an
important
role
in
self-protection
of
astrocytes
and
suppression
of
flavivirus
replication
in
the
CNS
.

Toll-like
Receptors
(
TLRs
)
sense
viral
infections
and
induce
production
of
type
I
interferons
(
IFNs
)
,
other
cytokines
,
and
chemokines
.

Viral
recognition
by
TLRs
and
other
pattern
recognition
receptors
(
PRRs
)
has
been
proven
to
be
cell-type
specific
.

Triggering
of
TLRs
with
selected
ligands
can
be
beneficial
against
some
viral
infections
.

Macrophages
are
antigen-presenting
cells
that
express
TLRs
and
have
a
key
role
in
the
innate
and
adaptive
immunity
against
viruses
.

Coronaviruses
(
CoVs
)
are
single-stranded
,
positive-sense
RNA
viruses
that
cause
acute
and
chronic
infections
and
can
productively
infect
macrophages
.

Investigation
of
the
interplay
between
CoVs
and
PRRs
is
in
its
infancy
.

We
assessed
the
effect
of
triggering
TLR2
,
TLR3
,
TLR4
,
and
TLR7
with
selected
ligands
on
the
susceptibility
of
the
J774A.1

cell
line
to
infection
with
murine
coronavirus
(
mouse
hepatitis
virus
,
[
MHV
]
)
.

Stimulation
of
TLR2
,
TLR4
,
or
TLR7
did
not
affect
MHV
production
.

In
contrast
,
pre-stimulation
of
TLR3
with
polyinosinic-polycytidylic
acid
(
poly
I
:
C
)
hindered
MHV
infection
through
induction
of
IFN-β
in
macrophages
.

We
demonstrate
that

.

In
addition
,
evidence
supports
that
this

causal
.

However
,
the
mechanisms
through

This
article
describes
the
INSPIRE
study
,
including
study
aims
,
design
,
recruitment
results
,
and
enrolled
population
characteristics
.

Methods/design
:
The
cohort
is
a
population
based
longitudinal
birth
cohort
of
term
healthy
infants
enrolled
during
the
first
months
of
life
over
a
two
year
period
.

Respiratory
infection
surveillance
was
conducted
from
November
to
March
of
the
first
year
of
life
,
through
surveys
administered
every
two
weeks
.

In-person
illness
visits
were
conducted
if
infants
met
pre-specified
criteria
for
a
respiratory
illness
visit
.

Infants
will
be
followed
annually
to
ages
3-4
years
for
assessment
of
the
primary
endpoint
:
wheezing
illness
.

Nasal
,
urine
,
stool
and
blood
samples
were
collected
at
various
time
points
throughout
the
study
for
measurements
of
host
and
viral
factors
that
predict
wheezing
illness
.

Nested
case-control
studies
will
additionally
be
used
to
address
other
primary
and
secondary
hypotheses
.

Discussion
:
In
the
INSPIRE
study
,
1952
infants
(
48
%
female
)
were
enrolled
during
the
two
enrollment
years
and
followup
will
continue
through
2016
.

The
mean
age
of
enrollment
was
60
days
.

During
winter
viral
season
,
more
than
14,000
surveillance
surveys
were
carried
out
resulting
in
2,103
respiratory
illness
visits
on
1189
infants
.

First
year
follow-up
has
been
completed
on
over
95
%
percent
of
participants
from
the
first
year
of
enrollment
.

With
ongoing
follow-up
for
wheezing
and
childhood
asthma
outcomes
,
the
INSPIRE
study
will
advance
our
understanding
of
the
complex
causal
relationship
between
RSV
infection
and
early
childhood
wheezing
and
asthma
.

Natural
HIV-1
protease
(
PR
)
is
homodimeric
.

Some
researchers
believe
that
interactions
between
HIV-1
Gag-Pol
molecules
trigger
the
activation
of
embedded
PR
(
which
mediates
Gag
and
Gag-Pol
cleavage
)
,
and
that
Gag-Pol
assembly
domains
outside
of
PR
may
contribute
to
PR
activation
by
influencing
PR
dimer
interaction
in
a
Gag-Pol
context
.

To
determine
if
the
enhancement
of
PR
dimer
interaction
facilitates
PR
activation
,
we
placed
single
or
tandem
repeat
leucine
zippers
(
LZ
)
at
the
PR
C-terminus
,
and
looked
for
a
correlation
between
enhanced
Gag
processing
efficiency
and
increased
Gag-PR-LZ
multimerization
capacity
.

We
found
significant
reductions
in
virus-like
particles
(
VLPs
)
produced
by
HIV-1
mutants
,
with
LZ
fused
to
the
end
of
PR
as
a
result
of
enhanced
Gag
cleavage
efficiency
.

Since
VLP
production
can
be
restored
to
wt
levels
following
PR
activity
inhibition
,
this
assembly
defect
is
considered
PR
activity-dependent
.

We
also
found
a
correlation
between
the
LZ
enhancement
effect
on
Gag
cleavage
and
enhanced
Gag-PR
multimerization
.

The
results
suggest
that
PR
dimer
interactions
facilitated
by
forced
Gag-PR
multimerization
lead
to
premature
Gag
cleavage
,
likely
a
result
of
premature
PR
activation
.

Our
conclusion
is
that
placement
of
a
heterologous
dimerization
domain
downstream
of
PR
enhances
PRmediated
Gag
cleavage
efficiency
,
implying
that
structural
conformation
,
rather
than
the
primary
sequence
outside
of
PR
,
is
a
major
determinant
of
HIV-1
PR
activation
.

Background
:
Fibroblast
growth
factor
21
(
FGF21
)
is
a
promising
drug
candidate
to
combat
metabolic
diseases
.

However
,
high-level
expression
and
purification
of
recombinant
FGF21
(
rFGF21
)
in
Escherichia
coli
(
E.
coli
)
is
difficult
because
rFGF21
forms
inclusion
bodies
in
the
bacteria
making
it
difficult
to
purify
and
obtain
high
concentrations
of
bioactive
rFGF21
.

To
overcome
this
problem
,
we
fused
the
FGF21
with
SUMO
(
Small
ubiquitin-related
modifier
)
by
polymerase
chain
reaction
(
PCR
)
,
and
expressed
the
fused
gene
in
E.
coli
BL21
(
DE3
)
.

Results
:
By
inducing
with
IPTG
,
SUMO-FGF21
was
expressed
at
a
high
level
.

Its
concentration
reached
30
%
of
total
protein
,
and
exceeded
95
%
of
all
soluble
proteins
.

The
fused
protein
was
purified
by
DEAE
sepharose
FF
and
Ni-NTA
affinity
chromatography
.

Once
cleaved
by
the
SUMO
protease
,
the
purity
of
rFGF21
by
high
performance
liquid
chromatography
(
HPLC
)
was
shown
to
be
higher
than
96
%
with
low
endotoxin
level
(
<
1.0
EU/ml
)
.

The
results
of
in
vivo
animal
experiments
showed
that
rFGF21
produced
by
using
this
method
,
could
decrease
the
concentration
of
plasma
glucose
in
diabetic
rats
by
streptozotocin
(
STZ
)
injection
.

Conclusions
:
This
study
demonstrated
that
SUMO
,
when
fused
with
FGF21
,
was
able
to
promote
its
soluble
expression
of
the
latter
in
E.
coli
,
making
it
more
convenient
to
purify
rFGF21
than
previously
.

This
may
be
a
better
method
to
produce
rFGF21
for
pharmaceutical
research
and
development
.

The
spike
(
S
)
protein
is
a
major
structural
glycoprotein
of
coronavirus
(
CoV
)
,
the
causal
agent
of
severe
acute
respiratory
syndrome
(
SARS
)
.

The
S
protein
is
a
potent
target
for
SARS-specific
cell-mediated
immune
responses
.

However
,
the
mechanism
CoV
pathogenesis
in
SARS
and
the
role
of
special
CTLs
in
virus
clearance
are
still
largely
uncharacterized
.

Here
,
we
describe
a
study
that
leads
to
the
identification
of
a
novel
HLA-A*0201-restricted
epitope
from
conserved
regions
of
S
protein
.

First
,
different
SARS-CoV
sequences
were
analyzed
to
predict
eight
candidate
peptides
from
conserved
regions
of
the
S
protein
based
upon
HLA-A*0201
binding
and
proteosomal
cleavage
.

Four
of
eight
candidate
peptides
were
tested
by
HLA-A*0201
binding
assays
.

Among
the
four
candidate
peptides
,
Sp8
(
S
958-966
,
VLNDILSRL
)
induced
specific
CTLs
both
ex
vivo
in
PBLs
of
healthy
HLA-A2
+
donors
and
in
HLA-A2.1/K
b
transgenic
mice
immunized
with
a
plasmid
encoding
full-length
S
protein
.

The
immunized
mice
released
IFN-γ
and
lysed
target
cells
upon
stimulation
with
Sp8
peptide-pulsed
autologous
dendritic
cells
in
comparison
to
other
candidates
.

These
results
suggest
that
Sp8
is
a
naturally
processed
epitope
.

We
propose
that
Sp8
epitope
should
help
in
the
characterization
of
mechanisms
of
virus
control
and
immunopathology
in
SARS-CoV
infection
.

The
binding
between
peptide
epitopes
and
major
histocompatibility
complex
proteins
(
MHCs
)
is
an
important
event
in
the
cellular
immune
response
.

Accurate
prediction
of
the
binding
between
short
peptides
and
the
MHC
molecules
has
long
been
a
principal
challenge
for
immunoinformatics
.

Recently
,
the
modeling
of
MHC-peptide
binding
has
come
to
emphasize
quantitative
predictions
:
instead
of
categorizing
peptides
as
``
binders
''
or
``
non-binders
''
or
as
``
strong
binders
''
and
``
weak
binders
''
,
recent
methods
seek
to
make
predictions
about
precise
binding
affinities
.

We
developed
a
quantitative
support
vector
machine
regression
(
SVR
)
approach
,
called
SVRMHC
,
to
model
peptide-MHC
binding
affinities
.

As
a
non-linear
method
,
SVRMHC
was
able
to
generate
models
that
out-performed
existing
linear
models
,
such
as
the
``
additive
method
''
.

By
adopting
a
new
``
11-factor
encoding
''
scheme
,
SVRMHC
takes
into
account
similarities
in
the
physicochemical
properties
of
the
amino
acids
constituting
the
input
peptides
.

When
applied
to
MHC-peptide
binding
data
for
three
mouse
class
I
MHC
alleles
,
the
SVRMHC
models
produced
more
accurate
predictions
than
those
produced
previously
.

Furthermore
,
comparisons
based
on
Receiver
Operating
Characteristic
(
ROC
)
analysis
indicated
that
SVRMHC
was
able
to
outperform
several
prominent
methods
in
identifying
strongly
binding
peptides
.

As
a
method
with
demonstrated
performance
in
the
quantitative
modeling
of
MHCpeptide
binding
and
in
identifying
strong
binders
,
SVRMHC
is
a
promising
immunoinformatics
tool
with
not
inconsiderable
future
potential
.

Background
:
Anti-viral
CD8
T-cell
activity
is
enhanced
and
prolonged
by
CD4
T-cell-mediated
help
,
but
negatively
regulated
by
inhibitory
B7-H1
interactions
.

During
viral
encephalomyelitis
,
the
absence
of
CD4
T
cells
decreases
CD8
T
cell
activity
and
impedes
viral
control
in
the
central
nervous
system
(
CNS
)
.

By
contrast
,
the
absence
of
B7-H1
enhances
CD8
T-cell
function
and
accelerates
viral
control
,
but
increases
morbidity
.

However
,
the
relative
contribution
of
CD4
T
cells
to
CD8
function
in
the
CNS
,
in
the
absence
of
B7-H1
,
remains
unclear
.

Methods
:
Wild-type
(
WT
)
and
B7-H1
−/−
mice
were
infected
with
a
gliatropic
coronavirus
and
CD4
T
cells
depleted
to
specifically
block
T
helper
function
in
the
CNS
.

Flow
cytometry
and
gene
expression
analysis
of
purified
T-cell
populations
from
lymph
nodes
and
the
CNS
was
used
to
directly
monitor
ex
vivo
T-cell
effector
function
.

The
biological
affects
of
altered
T-cell
responses
were
evaluated
by
analysis
of
viral
control
and
spinal-cord
pathology
.

Results
:
Increased
anti-viral
activity
by
CD8
T
cells
in
the
CNS
of
B7-H1
−/−
mice
was
lost
upon
depletion
of
CD4
T
cells
;
however
,
despite
concomitant
loss
of
viral
control
,
the
clinical
disease
was
less
severe
.

CD4
depletion
in
B7-H1
−/−
mice
also
decreased
inducible
nitric
oxide
synthase
expression
by
microglia
and
macrophages
,
consistent
with
decreased
microglia/macrophage
activation
and
reduced
interferon
(
IFN
)
-γ
.

Enhanced
production
of
IFN-γ
,
interleukin
(
IL
)
-10
and
IL-21
mRNA
was
seen
in
CD4
T
cells
from
infected
B7-H1
−/−
compared
with
WT
mice
,
suggesting
that
over-activated
CD4
T
cells
primarily
contribute
to
the
increased
pathology
.

The
local
requirement
of
CD4
T-cell
help
for
CD8
T-cell
function
is
not
overcome
if
B7-H1
inhibitory
signals
are
lost
.

Moreover
,
the
increased
effector
activity
by
CD8
T
cells
in
the
CNS
of
B7-H1
−/−
mice
is
attributable
not
only
to
the
absence
of
B7-H1
upregulation
on
major
histocompatibility
complex
class
I-presenting
resident
target
cells
,
but
also
to
enhanced
local
CD4
T-cell
function
.

B7-H1-mediated
restraint
of
CD4
T-cell
activity
is
thus
crucial
to
dampen
both
CD8
T-cell
function
and
microglia/macrophage
activation
,
thereby
providing
protection
from
T-cell-mediated
bystander
damage
.

The
Middle
East
respiratory
syndrome
coronavirus
(
MERS-CoV
)
,
an
emerging
human
coronavirus
,
causes
severe
acute
respiratory
illness
with
a
35
%
mortality
rate
.

In
light
of
the
recent
surge
in
reported
infections
we
have
developed
asymmetric
five-primer
reverse
transcription
loop-mediated
isothermal
amplification
(
RT-LAMP
)
assays
for
detection
of
MERS-CoV
.

Isothermal
amplification
assays
will
facilitate
the
development
of
portable
point-of-care
diagnostics
that
are
crucial
for
management
of
emerging
infections
.

The
RT-LAMP
assays
are
designed
to
amplify
MERS-CoV
genomic
loci
located
within
the
open
reading
frame
(
ORF
)
1a
and
ORF1b
genes
and
upstream
of
the
E
gene
.

Additionally
we
applied
one-step
strand
displacement
probes
(
OSD
)
for
real-time
sequence-specific
verification
of
LAMP
amplicons
.

Asymmetric
amplification
effected
by
incorporating
a
single
loop
primer
in
each
assay
accelerated
the
time-to-result
of
the
OSD-RT-LAMP
assays
.

The
resulting
assays
could
detect
0.02
to
0.2
plaque
forming
units
(
PFU
)
(
5
to
50
PFU/ml
)
of
MERS-CoV
in
infected
cell
culture
supernatants
within
30
to
50
min
and
did
not
cross-react
with
common
human
respiratory
pathogens
.

Diabetic
nephropathy
(
DN
)
is
the
most
common
cause
of
end-stage
kidney
disease
worldwide
and
is
associated
with
increased
morbidity
and
mortality
in
patients
with
both
type
1
and
type
2
diabetes
.

Recent
evidence
revealed
that
dipeptidyl
peptidase-4
(
DPP-4
)
inhibitors
may
exhibit
a
protective
effect
against
DN
.

In
fact
,
the
kidney
is
the
organ
where
the
DPP-4
activity
is
the
highest
level
per
organ
weight
.

A
preclinical
analysis
revealed
that
DPP-4
inhibitors
also
ameliorated
kidney
fibrosis
.

In
this
review
,
we
analyzed
recent
reports
in
this
field
and
explore
the
renoprotective
effects
and
possible
mechanism
of
the
DPP-4
inhibitors
.

Nonsense-mediated
messenger
RNA
(
mRNA
)
decay
(
NMD
)
is
a
surveillance
pathway
used
by
cells
to
control
the
quality
mRNAs
and
to
fine-tune
transcript
abundance
.

NMD
plays
an
important
role
in
cell
cycle
regulation
,
cell
viability
,
DNA
damage
response
,
while
also
serving
as
a
barrier
to
virus
infection
.

Disturbance
of
this
control
mechanism
caused
by
genetic
mutations
or
dys-regulation
of
the
NMD
pathway
can
lead
to
pathologies
,
including
neurological
disorders
,
immune
diseases
and
cancers
.

The
role
of
NMD
in
cancer
development
is
complex
,
acting
as
both
a
promoter
and
a
barrier
to
tumour
progression
.

Cancer
cells
can
exploit
NMD
for
the
downregulation
of
key
tumour
suppressor
genes
,
or
tumours
adjust
NMD
activity
to
adapt
to
an
aggressive
immune
microenvironment
.

The
latter
case
might
provide
an
avenue
for
therapeutic
intervention
as
NMD
inhibition
has
been
shown
to
lead
to
the
production
of
neoantigens
that
stimulate
an
immune
system
attack
on
tumours
.

For
this
reason
,
understanding
the
biology
and
co-option
pathways
of
NMD
is
important
for
the
development
of
novel
therapeutic
agents
.

Inhibitors
,
whose
design
can
make
use
of
the
many
structures
available
for
NMD
study
,
will
play
a
crucial
role
in
characterizing
and
providing
diverse
therapeutic
options
for
this
pathway
in
cancer
and
other
diseases
.

Influenza
A
viruses
(
IAVs
)
cause
seasonal
pandemics
and
epidemics
with
high
morbidity
and
mortality
,
which
calls
for
effective
anti-IAV
agents
.

The
glycoprotein
hemagglutinin
of
influenza
virus
plays
a
crucial
role
in
the
initial
stage
of
virus
infection
,
making
it
a
potential
target
for
anti-influenza
therapeutics
development
.

Here
we
found
that
quercetin
inhibited
influenza
infection
with
a
wide
spectrum
of
strains
,
including
A/Puerto
Rico/8/34
(
H1N1
)
,
A/FM-1/47/1
(
H1N1
)
,
and
A/Aichi/2/68
(

)
with
half
maximal

)
of
7.756˘1.097
,
6.225˘0.467
,
and
2.738˘1.931
µg/mL
,
respectively
.

Mechanism
studies
identified
that
quercetin
showed
interaction
with
the
HA2
subunit
.

Moreover
,
quercetin
could
inhibit
the
entry
of
the
H5N1
virus
using
the
pseudovirus-based
drug
screening
system
.

This
study
indicates
that
quercetin
showing
inhibitory
activity
in
the
early
stage
of
influenza
infection
provides
a
future
therapeutic
option
to
develop
effective
,
safe
and
affordable
natural
products
for
the
treatment
and
prophylaxis
of
IAV
infections
.

One
year
after
the
occurrence
of
the
first
case
of
infection
by
the
Middle
East
Respiratory
Syndrome
coronavirus
(
MERS-CoV
)
there
is
no
clear
consensus
on
the
best
treatment
to
propose
.

The
World
Health
Organization
,
as
well
as
several
other
national
agencies
,
are
still
working
on
different
clinical
approaches
to
implement
the
most
relevant
treatment
in
MERS-CoV
infection
.

We
compared
innate
and
adaptive
immune
responses
of
two
patients
infected
with
MERS-CoV
to
understand
the
underlying
mechanisms
involved
in
the
response
and
propose
potential
therapeutic
approaches
.

Broncho-alveolar
lavage
(
BAL
)
of
the
first
week
and
sera
of
the
first
month
from
the
two
patients
were
used
in
this
study
.

Quantitative
polymerase
chain
reaction
(
qRTPCR
)
was
performed
after
extraction
of
RNA
from
BAL
cells
of
MERS-CoV
infected
patients
and
control
patients
.

BAL
supernatants
and
sera
were
used
to
assess
cytokines
and
chemokines
secretion
by
enzyme-linked
immunosorbent
assay
.

The
first
patient
died
rapidly
after
3
weeks
in
the
intensive
care
unit
,
the
second
patient
still
recovers
from
infection
.

The
patient
with
a
poor
outcome
(
patient
1
)
,
compared
to
patient
2
,
did
not
promote
type-1
Interferon
(
IFN
)
,
and
particularly
IFNa
,
in
response
to
double
stranded
RNA
(
dsRNA
)
from
MERS-CoV
.

The
absence
of
IFNa
,
known
to
promote
antigen
presentation
in
response
to
viruses
,
impairs
the
development
of
a
robust
antiviral
adaptive
Th-1
immune
response
.

This
response
is
mediated
by
IL-12
and
IFNc
that
decreases
viral
clearance
;
levels
of
both
of
these
mediators
were
decreased
in
patient
1
.

Finally
,
we
confirm
previous
in
vitro
findings
that
MERS-CoV
can
drive
IL-17
production
in
humans
.

Host
recognition
of
viral
dsRNA
determines
outcome
in
the
early
stage
of
MERS-CoV
infection
.

We
highlight
the
critical
role
of
IFNa
in
this
initial
stage
to
orchestrate
a
robust
immune
response
and
bring
substantial
arguments
for
the
indication
of
early
IFNa
treatment
during
MERS-CoV
infection
.

Salmonella
enterica
serotype
Heidelberg
is
primarily
a
poultry
adapted
serotype
of
Salmonella
that
can
also
colonize
other
hosts
and
cause
human
disease
.

In
this
study
,
we
compared
the
genomes
of
outbreak
associated
non-outbreak
causing
Salmonella
ser
.

Heidelberg
strains
from
diverse
hosts
and
geographical
regions
.

Human
outbreak
associated
strains
in
this
study
were
from
a
2015
multistate
outbreak
of
Salmonella
ser
.

Heidelberg
involving
15
states
in
the
United
States
which
originated
from
bull
calves
.

Our
clinicopathologic
examination
revealed
that
cases
involving
Salmonella
ser
.

Heidelberg
strains
were
predominantly
young
,
less
than
weeks-old
,
dairy
calves
.

Pre-existing
or
concurrent
disease
was
found
in
the
majority
of
the
calves
.

Detection
of
Salmonella
ser
.

Heidelberg
correlated
with
markedly
increased
death
losses
clinically
comparable
to
those
seen
in
herds
infected
with
S.
Dublin
,
a
known
serious
pathogen
of
cattle
.

Whole
genome
based
single
nucleotide
polymorphism
based
analysis
revealed
that
these
calf
isolates
formed
a
distinct
cluster
along
with
outbreak
associated
human
isolates
.

The
defining
feature
of
the
outbreak
associated
strains
,
when
compared
to
older
isolates
of
S.
Heidelberg
,
is
that
all
isolates
in
this
cluster
contained
Saf
fimbrial
genes
which
are
generally
absent
in
S.
Heidelberg
.

The
acquisition
of
several
single
nucleotide
polymorphisms
and
the
gain
of
Saf
fimbrial
genes
may
have
contributed
to
the
increased
disease
severity
of
these
Salmonella
ser
.

The
establishment
of
persistent
viral
infection
is
often
associated
with
the
selection
of
one
or
more
mutant
viruses
.

For
example
,
it
has
been
found
that
an
intraleader
open
reading
frame
(
ORF
)
in
genomic
and
subgenomic
mRNA
(
sgmRNA
)
molecules
is
selected
during
bovine
coronavirus
(
BCoV
)
persistence
which
leads
to
translation
attenuation
of
the
downstream
ORF
.

Here
,
we
report
the
unexpected
identification
of
leaderless
genomes
,
in
addition
to
leader-containing
genomes
,
in
a
cell
culture
persistently
infected
with
BCoV
.

The
discovery
was
made
by
using
a
head-to-tail
ligation
method
that
examines
genomic
59-terminal
sequences
at
different
times
postinfection
.

Functional
analyses
of
the
leaderless
genomic
RNA
in
a
BCoV
defective
interfering
(
DI
)
RNA
revealed
that
(
1
)
the
leaderless
genome
was
able
to
serve
as
a
template
for
the
synthesis
of
negative-strand
genome
,
although
it
can
not
perform
replicative
positive-strand
genomic
RNA
synthesis
,
and
(
2
)
the
leaderless
genome
retained
its
function
in
translation
and
transcription
,
although
the
efficiency
of
these
processes
was
impaired
.

Therefore
,
this
previously
unidentified
leaderless
genome
is
associated
with
the
attenuation
of
genome
expression
.

Whether
the
leaderless
genome
contributes
to
the
establishment
of
persistent
infection
remains
to
be
determined
.

Protein
nuclear
transport
is
an
integral
process
to
many
cellular
pathways
and
often
plays
a
critical
role
during
viral
infection
.

To
overcome
the
barrier
presented
by
the
nuclear
membrane
and
gain
access
to
the
nucleus
,
virally
encoded
proteins
have
evolved
ways
to
appropriate
components
of
the
nuclear
transport
machinery
.

By
binding
karyopherins
,
or
the
nuclear
pore
complex
,
viral
proteins
influence
their
own
transport
as
well
as
the
transport
of
key
cellular
regulatory
proteins
.

This
review
covers
how
viral
proteins
can
interact
with
different
components
of
the
nuclear
import
machinery
and
how
this
influences
viral
replicative
cycles
.

We
also
highlight
the
effects
that
viral
perturbation
of
nuclear
transport
has
on
the
infected
host
and
how
we
can
exploit
viruses
as
tools
to
study
novel
mechanisms
of
protein
nuclear
import
.

Finally
,
we
discuss
the
possibility
that
drugs
targeting
these
transport
pathways
could
be
repurposed
for
treating
viral
infections
.

Rapid
population
migration
has
been
viewed
as
a
critical
factor
impacting
urban
network
construction
and
regional
sustainable
development
.

The
supervision
and
analysis
of
population
migration
are
necessary
for
guiding
the
optimal
allocation
of
urban
resources
and
for
attaining
the
high
efficiency
development
of
region
.

Currently
,
the
explorations
of
population
migration
are
often
restricted
by
the
limitation
of
data
.

In
the
information
era
,
search
engines
widely
collect
public
attention
,
implying
potential
individual
actions
,
and
freely
provide
open
,
timelier
,
and
large-scope
search
query
data
for
helping
explore
regional
phenomena
and
problems
.

In
this
paper
,
we
endeavor
to
explore
the
possibility
of
adopting
such
data
to
depict
population
migration
.

Based
on
the
search
query
from
Baidu
search
engine
,
three
migration
attention
indexes
(
MAIs
)
are
constructed
to
capture
public
migration
attention
in
cyber
space
.

Taking
three
major
urban
agglomerations
in
China
as
case
study
,
we
conduct
the
correlation
analysis
among
the
cyber
MAIs
and
population
migration
in
geographical
space
.

Results
have
shown
that
external-MAI
and
local-MAI
can
positively
reflect
the
population
migration
inner
regions
and
across
regions
from
a
holistic
lens
and
that
intercity-MAI
can
be
a
helpful
supplement
for
the
delineation
of
specific
population
flow
.

Along
with
the
accumulation
of
cyber
search
query
data
,
its
potential
in
exploring
population
migration
can
be
further
reinforced
.

Onconase
is
a
ribonuclease
that
presents
both
antitumor
and
antiviral
properties
linked
to
its
ribonucleolytic
activity
and
represents
a
new
class
of
RNA-damaging
drugs
.

It
has
reached
clinical
trials
for
the
treatment
of
several
cancers
and
human
papilloma
virus
warts
.

Onconase
targets
different
RNAs
in
the
cell
cytosol
but
Onconase-treated
cells
present
features
that
are
different
from
a
simple
arrest
of
protein
synthesis
.

We
have
used
microarray-derived
transcriptional
profiling
to
identify
Onconase-regulated
genes
in
two
ovarian
cancer
cell
lines
(
NCI/ADR-RES
and
OVCAR-8
)
.

RT-qPCR
analyses
have
confirmed
the
microarray
findings
.

We
have
identified
a
network
of
up-regulated
genes
implicated
in
different
signaling
pathways
that
may
explain
the
cytotoxic
effects
exerted
by
Onconase
.

Among
these
genes
,
activating
transcription
factor
3
(
ATF3
)
plays
a
central
role
in
the
key
events
triggered
by
Onconase
in
treated
cancer
cells
that
finally
lead
to
apoptosis
.

This
mechanism
,
mediated
by
ATF3
,
is
cell-type
independent
.

Up-regulation
of
ATF3
may
also
explain
the
antiviral
properties
of
this
ribonuclease
because
this
factor
is
involved
in
halting
viral
genome
replication
,
keeping
virus
latency
or
preventing
viral
oncogenesis
.

Finally
,
Onconase-regulated
genes
are
different
from
those
affected
by
nucleardirected
ribonucleases
.

Preparedness
for
a
possible
global
pandemic
caused
by
viruses
such
as
the
highly
pathogenic
influenza
A
subtype
H5N1
has
become
a
global
priority
.

In
particular
,
it
is
critical
to
monitor
the
appearance
of
any
new
emerging
subtypes
.

Comparative
phyloinformatics
can
be
used
to
monitor
,
analyze
,
and
possibly
predict
the
evolution
of
viruses
.

However
,
in
order
to
utilize
the
full
functionality
of
available
analysis
packages
for
largescale
phyloinformatics
studies
,
a
team
of
computer
scientists
,
biostatisticians
and
virologists
is
needed
-a
requirement
which
can
not
be
fulfilled
in
many
cases
.

Furthermore
,
the
time
complexities
of
many
algorithms
involved
leads
to
prohibitive
runtimes
on
sequential
computer
platforms
.

This
has
so
far
hindered
the
use
of
comparative
phyloinformatics
as
a
commonly
applied
tool
in
this
area
.

In
this
paper
the
graphical-oriented
workflow
design
system
called
Quascade
and
its
efficient
usage
for
comparative
phyloinformatics
are
presented
.

In
particular
,
we
focus
on
how
this
task
can
be
effectively
performed
in
a
distributed
computing
environment
.

As
a
proof
of
concept
,
the
designed
workflows
are
used
for
the
phylogenetic
analysis
of
neuraminidase
of
H5N1
isolates
(
micro
level
)
and
influenza
viruses
(
macro
level
)
.

The
results
of
this
paper
are
hence
twofold
.

Firstly
,
this
paper
demonstrates
the
usefulness
of
a
graphical
user
interface
system
to
design
and
execute
complex
distributed
workflows
for
large-scale
phyloinformatics
studies
of
virus
genes
.

Secondly
,
the
analysis
of
neuraminidase
on
different
levels
of
complexity
provides
valuable
insights
of
this
virus
's
tendency
for
geographical
based
clustering
in
the
phylogenetic
tree
and
also
shows
the
importance
of
glycan
sites
in
its
molecular
evolution
.

The
current
study
demonstrates
the
efficiency
and
utility
of
workflow
systems
providing
a
biologist
friendly
approach
to
complex
biological
dataset
analysis
using
high
performance
computing
.

In
particular
,
the
utility
of
the
platform
Quascade
for
deploying
distributed
and
parallelized
versions
of
a
variety
of
computationally
intensive
phylogenetic
algorithms
has
been
shown
.

Secondly
,
the
analysis
of
the
utilized
H5N1
neuraminidase
datasets
at
macro
and
micro
levels
has
clearly
indicated
a
pattern
of
spatial
clustering
of
the
H5N1
viral
isolates
based
on
geographical
distribution
rather
than
temporal
or
host
range
based
clustering
.

Herein
we
present
the
synthesis
of
a
novel
type
of
peptidomimetics
composed
of
repeating
diaminopropionic
acid
residues
modified
with
structurally
diverse
heterobifunctional
polyethylene
glycol
chains
(
abbreviated
as
DAPEG
)
.

Based
on
the
developed
compounds
,
a
library
of
fluorogenic
substrates
was

Further
library
deconvolution
towards

protease

(
NSP4
)
yielded
highly
sensitive
and
selective
internally
quenched
peptidomimetic
substrates
.

In
silico
analysis
of
the
obtained
peptidomimetics
revealed
the
presence
of
an
interaction
network
with
distant
subsites
located
on
the
enzyme
surface
.

Nevertheless
,
its
antivirus
evidence
in
animal
studies
is
not
satisfactory
,
which
might
be
due
to
the
lack
of
appropriate
animal
model
.

Previously
,
we
had
utilized
restraint
stress
to
establish
mouse
H1N1
susceptibility
model
which
was
helpful
in
evaluating
the
anti-virus
effect
of
medicines
targeting
host
factors
,
such
as
type
I
interferon
production
.

In
this
study
,
this
model
was
employed
to
investigate
the
effect
and
mechanism
of
indirubin
,
a
natural
bisindole
alkaloid
from
Isatis
indigotica
,
on
influenza
A
virus
susceptibility
.

In
the
in
vitro
study
,
the
stress
hormone
corticosterone
was
used
to
simulate
restraint
stress
.

Our
results
demonstrated
that
indirubin
decreased
the
susceptibility
to
influenza
virus
with
lowered
mortality
and
alleviated
lung
damage
in
restraint-stressed
mice
model
.

Moreover
,
indirubin
promoted
the
expression
of
interferon-β
and
interferon
inducible
transmembrane
3
.

In
addition
,
indirubin
maintained
the
morphology
and
function
of
mitochondria
following
influenza
A
virus
infection
.

Further
study
revealed
that
indirubin
promoted
interferon-β
production
through
promoting
mitochondrial
antiviral
signaling
pathway
.

Our
study
indicated
that
indirubin
could
be
a
candidate
for
the
therapy
of
influenza
.

The
respiratory
tract
is
constantly
exposed
to
the
external
environment
,
and
therefore
,
must
be
equipped
to
respond
to
and
eliminate
pathogens
.

Viral
clearance
and
resolution
of
infection
requires
a
complex
,
multi-faceted
response
initiated
by
resident
respiratory
tract
cells
and
innate
immune
cells
and
ultimately
resolved
by
adaptive
immune
cells
.

Although
an
effective
immune
response
to
eliminate
viral
pathogens
is
essential
,
a
prolonged
or
exaggerated
response
can
damage
the
respiratory
tract
.

Immune-mediated
pulmonary
damage
is
manifested
clinically
in
a
variety
of
ways
depending
on
location
and
extent
of
injury
.

Thus
,
the
antiviral
immune
response
represents
a
balancing
act
between
the
elimination
of
virus
and
immune-mediated
pulmonary
injury
.

In
this
review
,
we
highlight
major
components
of
the
host
response
to
acute
viral
infection
and
their
role
in
contributing
to
mitigating
respiratory
damage
.

We
also
briefly
describe
common
clinical
manifestations
of
respiratory
viral
infection
and
morphological
correlates
.

The
continuing
threat
posed
by
pandemic
influenza
as

as
the
emergence

lung
injury
such
as
SARS-CoV

This

Background
:
c-Jun
NH
2

(
JNK/SAPK
)
and
the
p38
mitogen-activated

kinase
(
p38

)
are
important
components
of
cellular
signal
transduction
pathways
,
which
have
been
reported
to
be
involved
in
viral
replication
.

However
,
little
is
known
about
JNK1/2
and
p38
MAPK
signaling
pathways
in
enterovirus
71
(
EV71
)
-infected
immature
dendritic
cells
(
iDCs
)
.

Thus
,
iDCs
were
induced
from
peripheral
blood
mononuclear
cells
(
PBMC
)
and
performed
to
explore
the
expressions
and
phosphorylation
of
molecules
in
the
two
signaling
pathways
as
well
as
secretions
of
inflammatory
cytokines
and
interferons
during
EV71
replication
.

Results
:
We
showed
that
EV71
infection
could
activate
both
JNK1/2
and
p38
MAPK
in
iDCs
and
phosphorylate
their
downstream
transcription
factors
c-Fos
and
c-Jun
,
which
further
promoted
the
production
of
IL-2
,
IL-6
,
IL-10
,
and
TNF-α
.

Moreover
,
EV71
infection
also
increased
the
release
of
IFN-β
and
IL-12
p40
.

Pretreatment
of
iDCs
with
SP600125
and
SB203580
(
20
μM
)
could
severely
impair
viral
replication
and
its
induced
phosphorylation
of
JNK1/2
,
p38
MAPK
,
c-Fos
and
c-Jun
.

In
addition
,
treatment
of
EV71-infected
iDCs
with
SP600125
and
SB203580
could
inhibit
secretions
of
IL-6
,
IL-10
and
TNF-α
.

Conclusion
:
JNK1/2
and
p38
MAPK
signaling
pathways
are
beneficial
to
EV71
infection
and
positively
regulate
secretions

East
Respiratory
Syndrome
(
MERS
)
epidemic
last
year
,
the
most
significant
one
is
the
realization
of
the
importance
of
communication
in
a
crisis
situation
.

Unlike
scientists
and
experts
who
recognize
risk
based
on
scientific
evidence
,
the
general
population
tends
to
have
more
fear
and
perceive
more
risk
than
the
actual
risk
itself
due
to
uncertainties
created
by
insufficient
and
inaccurate
information
.

Therefore
,
risk
communication
plays
a
major
role
in
reducing
the
gap
between
real
and
perceived
risk
,
and
in
effectively
delivering
accurate
information
.

As
a
result
of
the
failure
of
risk
communication
about
MERS
,
the
social
and
economic
disturbance
was
enormous
,
and
the
importance
of
risk
communication
was
realized
in
other
fields
such
as
healthcare
.

This
is
one
of
the
outcomes
of
experiencing
the
severity
of
the
MERS
epidemic
.

But
as
an
expert
in
health
communication
,
I
think
the
concept
of
communication
is
only
superficially
understood
.

There
is
a
tendency
to
think
of
it
only
as
determining
``
what
''
to
say
.

However
,
communication
is
a
complex
process
that
requires
not
only
consideration
of
content
,
but
also
consideration
of
how
,
to
whom
,
at
what
point
,
and
through
which
channel
to
deliver
the
content
.

Risk
communication
must
also
consider
the
nature
of
risk
,
people
's
characteristics
affecting
their
risk
perceptions
,
and
the
complex
media
environment
.

Thus
,
communication
experts
should
be
involved
with
health
and
medical
professionals
from
the
very
beginning
of
the
response
to
a
public
health
crisis
.

Background
:
Inanimate
surfaces
have
often
been
described
as
the
source
for
outbreaks
of
nosocomial
infections
.

The
aim
of
this
review
is
to
summarize
data
on
the
persistence
of
different
nosocomial
pathogens
on
inanimate
surfaces
.

The
literature
was
systematically
reviewed
in
MedLine
without
language
restrictions
.

In
addition
,
cited
articles
in
a
report
were
assessed
and
standard
textbooks
on
the
topic
were
reviewed
.

All
reports
with
experimental
evidence
on
the
duration
of
persistence
of
a
nosocomial
pathogen
on
any
type
of
surface
were
included
.

Heterogeneities
in
contact
networks
have
a
major
effect
in
determining
whether
a
pathogen
can
become
epidemic
or
persist
at
endemic
levels
.

Epidemic
models
that
determine
which
interventions
can
successfully
prevent
an
outbreak
need
to
account
for
social
structure
and
mixing
patterns
.

Contact
patterns
vary
across
age
and
locations
(
e.g
.

home
,
work
,
and
school
)
,
and
including
them
as
predictors
in
transmission
dynamic
models
of
pathogens
that
spread
socially
will
improve
the
models
'
realism
.

Data
from
population-based
contact
diaries
in
eight
European
countries
from
the
POLYMOD
study
were
projected
to
144
other
countries
using
a
Bayesian
hierarchical
model
that
estimated
the
proclivity
of
age-and-location-specific
contact
patterns
for
the
countries
,
using
Markov
chain
Monte
Carlo
simulation
.

Household
level
data
from
the
Demographic
and
Health
Surveys
for
nine
lower-income
countries
and
socio-demographic
factors
from
several
on-line
databases
for
152
countries
were
used
to
quantify
similarity
of
countries
to
estimate
contact
patterns
in
the
home
,
work
,
school
and
other
locations
for
countries
for
which
no
contact
data
are
available
,
accounting
for
demographic
structure
,
household
structure
where
known
,
and
a
variety
of
metrics
including
workforce
participation
and
school
enrolment
.

Contacts
are
highly
assortative
with
age
across
all
countries
considered
,
but
pronounced
regional
differences
in
the
age-specific
contacts
at
home
were
noticeable
,
with
more
inter-generational
contacts
in
Asian
countries
than
in
other
settings
.

Moreover
,
there
were
variations
in
contact
patterns
by
location
,
with
workplace
contacts
being
least
assortative
.

These
variations
led
to
differences
in
the
effect
of
social
distancing
measures
in
an
age
structured
epidemic
model
.

Contacts
have
an
important
role
in
transmission
dynamic
models
that
use
contact
rates
to
characterize
the
spread
of
contact-transmissible
diseases
.

This
study
provides
estimates
of
mixing
patterns
for
societies
for
which
contact
data
such
as
POLYMOD
are
not
yet
available

Most
observation
of
human
respiratory
virus
carriage
is
derived
from
medical
surveillance
;
however
,
the
infections
documented
by
this
surveillance
represent
only
a
symptomatic
fraction
of
the
total
infected
population
.

As
the
role
of
asymptomatic
infection
in
respiratory
virus
transmission
is
still
largely
unknown
and
rates
of
asymptomatic
shedding
are
not
well
constrained
,
it
is
important
to
obtain
more-precise
estimates
through
alternative
sampling
methods
.

We
actively
recruited
participants
from
among
visitors
to
a
New
York
City
tourist
attraction
.

Nasopharyngeal
swabs
,
demographics
,
and
survey
information
on
symptoms
,
medical
history
,
and
recent
travel
were
obtained
from
2,685
adults
over
two
seasonal
arms
.

We
used
multiplex
PCR
to
test
swab
specimens
for
a
selection
of
common
respiratory
viruses
.

A
total
of
6.2
%
of
samples
(
168
individuals
)
tested
positive
for
at
least
one
virus
,
with
5.6
%
testing
positive
in
the
summer
arm
and
7.0
%
testing
positive
in
the
winter
arm
.

Of
these
,
85
(
50.6
%
)
were
positive
for
human
rhinovirus
(
HRV
)
,
65
(
38.7
%
)
for
coronavirus
(
CoV
)
,
and
18
(
10.2
%
)
for
other
viruses
(
including
adenovirus
,
human
metapneumovirus
,
influenza
virus
,
and
parainfluenza
virus
)
.

Depending
on
the
definition
of
symptomatic
infection
,
65
%
to
97
%
of
infections
were
classified
as
asymptomatic
.

The
best-fit
model
for
prediction
of
positivity
across
all
viruses
included
a
symptom
severity
score
,
Hispanic
ethnicity
data
,
and
age
category
,
though
there
were
slight
differences
across
the
seasonal
arms
.

Though
having
symptoms
is
predictive
of
virus
positivity
,
there
are
high
levels
of
asymptomatic
respiratory
virus
shedding
among
the
members
of
an
ambulatory
population
in
New
York
City
.

IMPORTANCE
Respiratory
viruses
are
common
in
human
populations
,
causing
significant
levels
of
morbidity
.

Understanding
the
distribution
of
these
viruses
is
critical
for
designing
control
methods
.

However
,
most
data
available
are
from
medical
records
and
thus
predominantly
represent
symptomatic
infections
.

Estimates
for
asymptomatic
prevalence
are
sparse
and
span
a
broad
range
.

In
this
study
,
we
aimed
to
measure
more
precisely
the
proportion
of
infections
that
are
asymptomatic
in
a
general
,
ambulatory
adult
population
.

We
recruited
participants
from
a
New
York
City
tourist
attraction
and
administered
nasal
swabs
,
testing
them
for
adenovirus
,
coronavirus
,
human
metapneumovirus
,
rhinovirus
,
influenza
virus
,
respiratory
syncytial
virus
,
and
parainfluenza
virus
.

At
recruitment
,
participants
completed
surveys
on
demographics
and
symptomology
.

Analysis
of
these
data
indicated
that
over
6
%
of
participants
tested
positive
for
shedding
of
respiratory
virus
.

While
participants
who
tested
positive
were
more
likely
to
report
symptoms
than
those
who
did
not
,
over
half
of
participants
who
tested
positive
were
asymptomatic
.

In
this
study
of~2,700
adult
visitors
to
an
NYC
tourist
attraction
during
summer
and
winter
months
,
we
found
that
over
6
%
of
participants
tested
positive
for
respiratory
virus
shedding
,
though
over
half
were
asymptomatic

Antimicrobial
drugs
may
be
used
to
treat
diarrheal
illness
in
companion
animals
.

It
is
important
to
monitor
antimicrobial
use
to
better
understand
trends
and
patterns
in
antimicrobial
resistance
.

There
is
no
monitoring
of
antimicrobial
use
in
companion
animals
in
Canada
.

To
explore
how
the
use
of
electronic
medical
records
could
contribute
to
the
ongoing
,
systematic
collection
of
antimicrobial
use
data
in
companion
animals
,
anonymized
electronic
medical
records
were
extracted
from
12
participating
companion
animal
practices
and
warehoused
at
the
University
of
Calgary
.

We
used
the
prediagnostic
,
clinical
features
of
diarrhea
as
the
case
definition
in
this
study
.

Using
text-mining
technologies
,
cases
of
diarrhea
were
described
by
each
of
the
following
variables
:
diagnostic
laboratory
tests
performed
,
the
etiological
diagnosis
and
antimicrobial
therapies
.

The
ability
of
the
text
miner
to
accurately
describe
the
cases
for
each
of
the
variables
was
evaluated
.

It
could
not
reliably
classify
cases
in
terms
of
diagnostic
tests
or
etiological
diagnosis
;
a
manual
review
of
a
random
sample
of
500
diarrhea
cases
determined
that
88/500
(
17.6
%
)
of
the
target
cases
underwent
diagnostic
testing
of
which
36/88
(
40.9
%
)
had
an
etiological
diagnosis
.

Text

.

Overall
,
7400/15,928
(
46.5
%
)
of
pets
presenting
with
diarrhea
were
treated
with
antimicrobials
.

Some
temporal
trends
and
patterns
of
the
antimicrobial
use
are
described
.

The
results
from
this
study
suggest
that
informatics
and
the
electronic
medical
records
could
be
useful
for
monitoring
trends
in
antimicrobial
use
.

Background
:
Influenza
viruses
cause
serious
infections
that
can
be
prevented
or
treated
using
vaccines
or
antiviral
agents
,
respectively
.

While
vaccines
are
effective
,
they
have
a
number
of
limitations
,
and
influenza
strains
resistant
to
currently
available
anti-influenza
drugs
are
increasingly
isolated
.

This
necessitates
the
exploration
of
novel
anti-influenza
therapies
.

Methodology/Principal
Findings
:
We
investigated
the
potential
of
aurintricarboxylic
acid
(
ATA
)
,
a
potent
inhibitor
of
nucleic
acid
processing
enzymes
,
to
protect
Madin-Darby
canine
kidney
cells
from
influenza
infection
.

We
found
,
by
neutral
red
assay
,
that
ATA
was
protective
,
and
by
RT-PCR
and
ELISA
,
respectively
,
confirmed
that
ATA
reduced
viral
replication
and
release
.

Furthermore
,
while
pre-treating
cells
with
ATA
failed
to
inhibit
viral
replication
,
pre-incubation
of
virus
with
ATA
effectively
reduced
viral
titers
,
suggesting
that
ATA
may
elicit
its
inhibitory
effects
by
directly
interacting
with
the
virus
.

Electron
microscopy
revealed
that
ATA
induced
viral
aggregation
at
the
cell
surface
,
prompting
us
to
determine
if
ATA
could
inhibit
neuraminidase
.

ATA
was
found
to
compromise
the
activities
of
virus-derived
and
recombinant
neuraminidase
.

Moreover
,
an
oseltamivir-resistant
H1N1
strain
with
H274Y
was
also
found
to
be
sensitive
to
ATA
.

Finally
,
we
observed
additive
protective
value
when
infected
cells
were
simultaneously
treated
with
ATA
and
amantadine
hydrochloride
,
an
antiinfluenza
drug
that
inhibits
M2-ion
channels
of
influenza
A
virus
.

Conclusions/Significance
:
Collectively
,
these
data
suggest
that
ATA
is
a
potent
anti-influenza
agent
by
directly
inhibiting
the
neuraminidase
and
could
be
a
more
effective
antiviral
compound
when
used
in
combination
with
amantadine
hydrochloride
.

Tissues
obtained
post-mortem
from
cattle
persistently
infected
with
foot-and-mouth
disease
virus
(
FMDV
)
were
analyzed
to
characterize
the
tissue-specific
localization
of
FMDV
and
partial
transcriptome
profiles
for
selected
immunoregulatory
cytokines
.

Analysis
of
28
distinct
anatomic
sites
from
21
steers
infected
with
FMDV
serotype
A
,
O
or
SAT2
,
had
the
highest
prevalence
of
overall
viral
detection
in
the
dorsal
nasopharynx
(
80.95
%
)
and
dorsal
soft
palate
(
71.43
%
)
.

FMDV
was
less
frequently
detected
in
laryngeal
mucosal
tissues
,
oropharyngeal
mucosal
sites
,
and
lymph
nodes
draining
the
pharynx
.

Immunomicroscopy
indicated
that
within
persistently
infected
mucosal
tissues
,
FMDV
antigens
were
rarely
detectable
within
few
epithelial
cells
in
regions
of
mucosa-associated
lymphoid
tissue
(
MALT
)
.

Transcriptome
analysis
of
persistently
infected
pharyngeal
tissues
by
qRT-PCR
for
14
cytokine
genes
indicated
a
general
trend
of
decreased
mRNA
levels
compared
to
uninfected
control
animals
.

Increased

)
.

Overall
,
this
data
demonstrates
that
during
the
FMDV
carrier
state
in
cattle
,
viral
persistence
is
associated
with
epithelial
cells
of
the
nasopharynx
in
the
upper
respiratory
tract
and
decreased
levels
of
mRNA
for
several
immunoregulatory
cytokines
in
the
infected
tissues
.

Although
canine
adenovirus
(
CAdV
)
is
highly
prevalent
in
dogs
,
there
is
currently
a
lack
of
a
quick
diagnostic
method
.

In
this
study
,
we
developed
a
rapid
immunochromatographic
strip
(
ICS
)
assay
using
colloidal
gold
coupled
to
CAdV-2-specific
monoclonal
antibodies
(
mAbs
)
.

BALB/c
mice
were
immunized
with
a
purified
CAdV-2
suspension
,
and
four
mAbs
(
belonging
to
two
different
epitopes
)
were
generated
and
designated
as
2C1
,
7D7
,
10D1
,
and
4G1
.

Western
blot
and
protein
spectral
analysis
indicated
that
the
hexon
protein
of
CAdV-2
recognized
all
four
mAbs
.

The
colloidal
gold-coupled
7D7
and
2C1
mAbs
were
chosen
for
inclusion
in
the
rapid
ICS
assay
.

The
optimal
concentrations
of
the
coating
antibody
(
2C1
)
,
the
capture
antibody
(
7D7
)
,
and
the
goat
anti-mouse
antibody
were
1.0
mg/ml
,
10
µg/ml
,
and
2.0
mg/ml
,
respectively
.

The
limit
of
detection
was
approximately
2.0
×
10
2
tissue
culture
infective
dose
(
TCID
50
)
/ml
.

Other
common
canine
viruses
were
tested
to
evaluate
the
specificity
of
the
ICS
,
and
positive
results
were
observed
for
only
CAdV-1
and
CAdV-2
.

The
ICS
test
was
conducted
on
360
samples
to
detect
CAdV
,
and
the
results
were
compared
with
those
of
polymerase
chain
reaction
(
PCR
)
tests
.

The
ICS
test
was
found
to
be
a
sufficiently
sensitive
and
specific
detection
method
for
the
convenient
and
rapid
detection
of
CAdV
.

Herbal
medicine
,
including
traditional
Chinese
medicine
(
TCM
)
,
is
widely
used
worldwide
.

Herbs
and
TCM
formulas
contain
numerous
active
molecules
.

Basically
,
they
are
a
kind
of
cocktail
therapy
.

Herb-drug
,
herb-food
,
herb-herb
,
herb-microbiome
,
and
herb-disease
interactions
are
complex
.

There
is
potential
for
both
benefit
and
harm
,
so
only
after
understanding
more
of
their
mechanisms
and
clinical
effects
can
herbal
medicine
and
TCM
be
helpful
to
users
.

Many
pharmacologic
studies
have
been
performed
to
unravel
the
molecular
mechanisms
;
however
,
basic
and
clinical
studies
of
good
validity
are
still
not
enough
to
translate
experimental
results
into
clinical
understanding
and
to
provide
tough
evidence
for
better
use
of
herbal
medicines
.

There
are
still
issues
regarding
the
conflicting
pharmacologic
effects
,
pharmacokinetics
,
drug
interactions
,
adverse
and
clinical
effects
of
herbal
medicine
and
TCM
.

Understanding
study
validation
,
pharmacologic
effects
,
drug
interactions
,
indications
and
clinical
effects
,
adverse
effects
and
limitations
,
can
all
help
clinicians
in
providing
adequate
suggestions
to
patients
.

At
present
,
it
would
be
better
to
use
herbs
and
TCM
formulas
according
to
their
traditional
indications
matching
the
disease
pathophysiology
and
their
molecular
mechanisms
.

,
there
is
still
much
work
to
be

Synthesis
route
of
ω-azido-sphingosine
:
The

was
obtained
by
olefin
cross-metathesis
reaction
using
Grubbs
catalyst
2
nd

,
which
is
a
known
method
for
the
synthesis
of
various

has
already
been
described
by
Garrido
et

.

Here
we
synthesized
a
more
natural
C

long-chain
base
,
starting
from
the
building

1,2
.

After
metathesis
reaction
,
the
desired
E-configurated

in
an
excellent
yield
.

Subsequent
cleavage
of
the
silyl
ether
using
tetra-n-butylammonium
fluoride
in
tetrahydrofuran
gave
diol

.

In
the
final
step
,
a
dichloromethane
solution
of
the
carbamate
was
treated
with
trifluoroacetic
acid
to
provide
ω-azido-sphingosine
(

Avian
coronavirus
,
the
causative
agent
of
avian
infectious
bronchitis
,
occurs
as
multiple
genotypes
and
lineages
,
and
full
genomes
are
not
available
for
the
majority
of
them
.

This
paper
reports
the
(
previously
unknown
)
complete
genome
sequence
of
strain
D274
of
this
virus
(
27,599
nucleotides
)
,
isolated
from
chickens
in
The
Netherlands
in
1979
.

Background
:
International
wildlife
trade
is
one
of
the
leading
threats
to
biodiversity
conservation
.

The
Convention
on
International
Trade
in
Endangered
Species
of
Wild
Fauna
and
Flora
(
CITES
)
is
the
most
important
initiative
to
monitor
and
regulate
the
international
trade
of
wildlife
but
its
credibility
is
dependent
on
the
quality
of
the
trade
data
.

We
report
on
the
performance
of
CITES
reporting
by
focussing
on
the
commercial
trade
in
non-native
reptiles
and
amphibians
into
Thailand
as
to
illustrate
trends
,
species
composition
and
numbers
of
wild-caught
vs.
captive-bred
specimens
.

Methodology/Principal
Findings
:
Based
on
data
in
the
WCMC-CITES
trade
database
,
we
establish
that
a
total
of
75,594
individuals
of
169
species
of
reptiles
and
amphibians
(
including
27
globally
threatened
species
)
were
imported
into
Thailand
in
1990-2007
.

The
majority
of
individuals
(
59,895
,
79
%
)
were
listed
as
captive-bred
and
a
smaller
number
(
15,699
,
21
%
)
as
wild-caught
.

In
the
1990s
small
numbers
of
individuals
of
a
few
species
were
imported
into
Thailand
,
but
in
2003
both
volumes
and
species
diversity
increased
rapidly
.

The
proportion
of
captive-bred
animals
differed
greatly
between
years
(
from
0
to
.80
%
)
.

Wild-caught
individuals
were
mainly
sourced
from
African
countries
,
and
captive-bred
individuals
from
Asian
countries
(
including
from
non-CITES
Parties
)
.

There
were
significant
discrepancies
between
exports
and
imports
.

Thailand
reports
the
import
of
.10,000
individuals
(
51
species
)
originating
from
Kazakhstan
,
but
Kazakhstan
reports
no
exports
of
these
species
.

Similar
discrepancies
,
involving
smaller
numbers
(
.100
individuals
of
9
species
)
,
can
be
seen
in
the
import
of
reptiles
into
Thailand
via
Macao
.

Conclusion/Significance
:
While
there
has
been
an
increase
in
imports
of
amphibian
and
reptiles
into
Thailand
,
erratic
patterns
in
proportions
of
captive-bred
specimens
and
volumes
suggests
either
capricious
markets
or
errors
in
reporting
.

Large
discrepancies
with
respect
to
origin
point
to
misreporting
or
possible
violations
of
the
rules
and
intentions
of
CITES

Background
:
The
continuing
spread
of
the
newly
emerged
H7N9
virus
among
poultry
in
China
,
as
well
as
the
possibility
of
human-to-human
transmission
,
has
attracted
numerous
efforts
to
develop
an
effective
vaccine
against
H7N9
.

The
use
of
nanoparticles
in
vaccinology
is
inspired
by
the
fact
that
most
pathogens
have
a
dimension
within
the
nano-size
range
and
therefore
can
be
processed
efficiently
by
the
immune
system
,
which
leads
to
a
potent
immune
response
.

Herein
,
we
report
a
facile
approach
to
increase
antigen
size
to
achieve
not
only
fast
but
also
effective
responses
against
the
recombinant
HA/H7N9
protein
via
a
simple
conjugation
of
the
protein
onto
the
surface
of
nanodiamond
particles
.

In
this
study
,
trimeric
Haemagglutinin
(
H7
)
that
is
transiently
expressed
in
N.
benthamiana
was
purified
using
affinity
chromatography
,
and
its
trimeric
state
was
revealed
successfully
by
the
cross-linking
reaction
.

The
trimeric
H7
solution
was
subsequently
mixed
with
a
nanodiamond
suspension
in
different
ratios
.

The
successful
conjugation
of
the
trimeric
H7
onto
the
surface
of
nanodiamond
particles
was
demonstrated
by
the
changes
in
size
and
Zetapotential
of
the
particles
before
and
after
protein
coating
,
Sodium
dodecyl
sulfate
polyacrylamide
gel
electrophoresis
(
SDS-PAGE
)
,
and
Western-blot
analysis
.

Next
,
biofunction
of
the
protein-nanodiamond
conjugates
was
screened
using
a
haemagglutination
assay
.

A
mixture
containing
5
µg
of
trimeric
H7
and
60
µg
of
nanodiamond
corresponds
to
a
ratio
of
1:12
(
w/w
)
of
agglutinated
chicken
red
blood
cells
at
HA
titer
of
1024
,
which
is
512-fold
higher
than
the
HA
titer
of
free
trimeric
H7
.

After
the
2nd
and
3rd
immunization
in
mice
,
ELISA
and
Western
blot
analyses
demonstrated
that
the
physical
mixture
of
trimeric
H7
protein
and
nanodiamond
(
1:12
,
w/w
)
elicited
statistically
significant
stronger
H7-specific-IgG
response
demonstrated
by
higher
amounts
of
H7N9-specific
IgG
(
over
15.4-fold
with
P
<
0.05
after
the
second
immunization
)
.

These
results
indicated
a
potential
effect
inherent
to
nanodiamond
towards
modulating
immune
systems
,
which
should
be
further
evaluated
and
broadly
applied
in
nanovaccine
development

The

110
consecutive

,
aged
from
1

were
collected
from
five
distinct
general

The

as
compared
to
a
real-time

which
was
used
as

.

The
results
of

These

the
capability

for
simultaneous
detection
of
broad-spectrum
respiratory

in

of
accessing
to
the
actual
sequences
,
showing
great
potential
use
of
epidemic
outbreak
investigation
.

The
detection
results
should
be
carefully
interpreted
when
introducing
this
technique
in
the
clinical
diagnostics
.

Low-fidelity
RNA-dependent
RNA
polymerases
for
many
RNA
virus
mutators
have
been
shown
to
confer
attenuated
phenotypes
,
presumably
due
to
increased
mutation
rates
.

Additionally
,
for
many
RNA
viruses
,
replication
to
high
titers
results
in
the
production
of
defective
interfering
particles
(
DIs
)
that
also
attenuate
infection
.

We
hypothesized
that
fidelity
,
recombination
,
and
DI
production
are
tightly
linked
.

We
show
that
a
Sindbis
virus
mutator
replicating
at
a
high
multiplicity
of
infection
manifests
an
earlier
and
greater
accumulation
of
DIs
than
its
wild-type
counterpart
.

The
isolated
DIs
interfere
with
the
replication
of
full-length
virus
in
a
dose-dependent
manner
.

Importantly
,
the
ability
of
the
mutator
virus
to
overproduce
DIs
could
be
linked
to
an
increased
recombination
frequency
.

These
data
confirm
that
RNA-dependent
RNA
polymerase
fidelity
and
recombination
are
inversely
correlated
for
this
mutator
.

Our
findings
suggest
that
defective
interference
resulting
from
higher
recombination
rates
may
be
more
detrimental
to
RNA
virus
mutators
than
the
increase
in
mutational
burden
.

as
an
anti-bacterial
,
anti-viral
,
and
anti-parasitic
protein
.

These
functions
differ
among
lactoferrin
homologs
in
mammals
.

Although
considerable
attention
has
been
given
to
the
many
functions
of
lactoferrin
,
its
primary
nutritional
contribution
is
presumed
to
be
related
to
its
iron-binding
characteristics
,
whereas
the
role
of
glycosylation
has
been
neglected
.

Given
the
critical
role
of
glycan
binding
in
many
biological
processes
,
the
glycan
moieties
in
lactoferrin
are
likely
to
contribute
significantly
to
the
biological
roles
of
lactoferrin
.

Despite
the
high
amino
acid
sequence
homology
in
different
lactoferrins
(
up
to
99
%
)
,
each
exhibits
a
unique
glycosylation
pattern
that
may
be
responsible
for
heterogeneity
of
the
biological
properties
of
lactoferrins
.

An
important
task
for
the
production
of
biotherapeutics
and
medical
foods
containing
bioactive
glycoproteins
is
the
assessment
of
the
contributions
of
individual
glycans
to
the
observed
bioactivities
.

This
review
examines
how
the
study
of
lactoferrin
glycosylation
patterns
can
increase
our
understanding
of
lactoferrin
functionality
.

The
HIV-1
subtype
B
epidemic
amongst
men
who
have
sex
with
men
(
MSM
)
is
resurgent
in
many
countries
despite
the
widespread
use
of
effective
combination
antiretroviral
therapy
(
cART
)
.

In
this
combined
mathematical
and
phylogenetic
study
of
observational
data
,
we
aimed
to
find
out
the
extent
to
which
the
resurgent
epidemic
is
the
result
of
newly
introduced
strains
or
of
growth
of
already
circulating
strains
.

As
of
November
2011
,
the
ATHENA
observational
HIV
cohort
of
all
patients
in
care
in
the
Netherlands
since
1996
included
HIV-1
subtype
B
polymerase
sequences
from
5,852
patients
.

Patients
who
were
diagnosed
between
1981
and
1995
were
included
in
the
cohort
if
they
were
still
alive
in
1996
.

The
ten
most
similar
sequences
to
each
ATHENA
sequence
were
selected
from
the
Los
Alamos
HIV
Sequence
Database
,
and
a
phylogenetic
tree
was
created
of
a
total
of
8,320
sequences
.

Large
transmission
clusters
that
included
!
10
ATHENA
sequences
were
selected
,
with
a
local
support
value
!

0.9
and
median
pairwise
patristic
distance
below
the
fifth
percentile
of
distances
in
the
whole
tree
.

Time-varying
reproduction
numbers
of
the
large
MSM-majority
clusters
were
estimated
through
PLOS
Medicine
|
mathematical
modeling
.

We
identified
106
large
transmission
clusters
,
including
3,061
(
52
%
)
ATHENA
and
652
Los
Alamos
sequences
.

Half
of
the
HIV
sequences
from
MSM
registered
in
the
cohort
in
the
Netherlands
(
2,128
of
4,288
)
were
included
in
91
large
MSMmajority
clusters
.

Strikingly
,
at
least
54
(
59
%
)
of
these
91
MSM-majority
clusters
were
already
circulating
before
1996
,
when
cART
was
introduced
,
and
have
persisted
to
the
present
.

Overall
,
1,226
(
35
%
)
of
the
3,460
diagnoses
among
MSM
since
1996
were
found
in
these
54
long-standing
clusters
.

The
reproduction
numbers
of
all
large
MSM-majority
clusters
were
around
the
epidemic
threshold
value
of
one
over
the
whole
study
period
.

A
tendency
towards
higher
numbers
was
visible
in
recent
years
,
especially
in
the
more
recently
introduced
clusters
.

The
mean
age
of
MSM
at
diagnosis
increased
by
0.45
years/
year
within
clusters
,
but
new
clusters
appeared
with
lower
mean
age
.

Major
strengths
of
this
study
are
the
high
proportion
of
HIV-positive
MSM
with
a
sequence
in
this
study
and
the
combined
application
of
phylogenetic
and
modeling
approaches
.

Main
limitations
are
the
assumption
that
the
sampled
population
is
representative
of
the
overall
HIV-positive
population
and
the
assumption
that
the
diagnosis
interval
distribution
is
similar
between
clusters
.

The

on

subjects
related
to

,
treatment
and

.

During

2015
,
held
in
Geneva
in
June
2015
,
a
full
one-day
session
focused
on
the
2014-2015
Ebola
virus
disease
(
EVD
)
outbreak
in
West
Africa
.

This
article
is
a
non-exhaustive
compilation
of
these
discussions
.

It
concentrates
on
lessons
learned
and
imagining
a
way
forward
for
the
communities
most
affected
by
the
epidemic
.

The
reader
can
access
video
recordings
of
all
lectures
delivered
during
this
one-day
session
,
as
referenced
.

Topics
include
the
timeline
of
the
international
response
,
linkages
between
the
dynamics
of
the
epidemic
and
infection
prevention
and
control
,
the
importance
of
community
engagement
,
and
updates
on
virology
,
diagnosis
,
treatment
and
vaccination
issues
.

The
paper
also
includes
discussions
from
public
health
,
infectious
diseases
,
critical
care
and
infection
control
experts
who
cared
for
patients
with
EVD
in
Africa
,
in
Europe
,
and
in
the
United
Sates
and
were
involved
in
Ebola
preparedness
in
both
high-and
low-resource
settings
and
countries
.

This
review
concludes
that
too
little
is
known
about
the
pathogenesis
and
treatment
of
EVD
,
therefore
basic
and
applied
research
in
this
area
are
urgently
required
.

Furthermore
,
it
is
clear
that
epidemic
preparedness
needs
to
improve
globally
,
in
particular
through
the
strengthening
of
health
systems
at
local
and
national
levels
.

There
is
a
strong
need
for
culturally
sensitive
approaches
to
public
health
which
could
be
designed
and
delivered
by
social
scientists
and
medical
professionals
working
together
.

As
of
December
2015
,
this
epidemic
killed
more
than
11,000
people
and
infected
more
than
28,000
;
it
has
also
generated
more
than
17,000
survivors
and
orphans
,
many
of
whom
face
somatic
and
psychological
complications
.

The
continued
treatment
and
rehabilitation
of
these
people
is
a
public
health
priority
,
which
also
requires
an
integration
of
specific
medical
and
social
science
approaches
,
not
always
available
in
West
Africa
.

Feline
panleukopenia
(
FPL
)
,
a
frequently
fatal
disease
of
cats
,
is
caused
by
feline
parvovirus
(
FPV
)
or
canine
parvovirus
(
CPV
)
.

We
investigated
simultaneous
outbreaks
of
FPL
between
2014
and
2018
in
Australia
,
New
Zealand
and
the
United
Arab
Emirates
(
UAE
)
where
FPL
outbreaks
had
not
been
reported
for
several
decades
.

Case
data
from
989
cats
and
clinical
samples
from
additional
113
cats
were
obtained
to
determine
the
cause
of
the
outbreaks
and
epidemiological
factors
involved
.

Most
cats
with
FPL
were
shelter-housed
,
9
to
10
weeks
old
at
diagnosis
,
unvaccinated
,
had
not
completed
a
primary
vaccination
series
or
had
received
vaccinations
noncompliant
with
current
guidelines
.

Analysis
of
parvoviral
VP2
sequence
data
confirmed
that
all
FPL
cases
were
caused
by
FPV
and
not
CPV
.

Phylogenetic
analysis
revealed
that
each
of
these
outbreaks
was
caused
by
a
distinct
FPV
,
with
two
virus
lineages
present
in
eastern
Australia
and
virus
movement
between
different
geographical
locations
.

Viruses
from
the
UAE
outbreak
formed
a
lineage
of
unknown
origin
.

FPV
vaccine
virus
was
detected
in
the
New
Zealand
cases
,
highlighting
the
difficulty
of
distinguishing
the
co-incidental
shedding
of
vaccine
virus
in
vaccinated
cats
.

Inadequate
vaccination
coverage
in
shelter-housed
cats
was
a
common
factor
in
all
outbreaks
,
likely
precipitating
the
multiple
re-emergence
of
infection
events
.

The
ever-increasing
speed
and
scope
of
human
mobility
by
international
air
travel
has
led
to
a
global
transport
network
for
infectious
diseases
with
the
potential
to
introduce
pathogens
into
non-endemic
areas
,
and
to
facilitate
rapid
spread
of
novel
or
mutated
zoonotic
agents
.

Robust
national
emergency
preparedness
is
vital
to
mitigate
the
transmission
of
infectious
diseases
agents
domestically
and
to
prevent
onward
spread
to
other
countries
.

Given
the
complex
range
of
stakeholders
who
respond
to
an
infectious
disease
threat
being
transmitted
through
air
travel
,
it
is
important
that
protocols
be
tested
and
practised
extensively
in
advance
of
a
real
emergency
.

Simulation
exercises
include
the
identification
of
possible
scenarios
based
on
the
probability
of
hazards
and
the
vulnerability
of
populations
as
a
basis
for
planning
,
and
provide
a
useful
measure
of
preparedness
efforts
and
capabilities
.

In
October
2016
,
a
live
simulation
exercise
was
conducted
at
a
major
airport
in
Ireland
incorporating
a
public
health
threat
for
the
first
time
,
with
the
notification
of
a
possible
case
of
MERS-CoV
aboard
an
aircraft
plus
an
undercarriage
fire
.

Strengths
of
the
response
to
the
communicable
disease
threat
included
appropriate
public
health
risk
assessment
,
case
management
,
passenger
information
gathering
,
notification
to
relevant
parties
,
and
communication
to
passengers
and
multiple
agencies
.

Lessons
learned
include
:
o
Exercise
planning
should
not
be
overly
ambitious
.

In
testing
too
many
facets
of
emergency
response
,
the
public
health
response
could
be
deprioritised
.

o
The
practical
implementation
of
communication
protocols
in
a
real-time
exercise
of
this
scope
proved
challenging
.

These
protocols
should
continue
to
be
checked
and
tested
by
desk-top
exercises
to
ensure
that
all
staff
concerned
are
familiar
with
them
,
especially
in
the
context
of
staff
turn-over
.

o
The
roles
and
responsibilities
of
the
various
agencies
must
be
clear
to
avoid
role
confusion
.

o
Equipment
and
infrastructure
capacities
must
be
considered
and
in
place
in
advance
of
an
actual
incident
or
test
,
for
example
whether
or
not
cell
phone
signals
require
boosting
during
a
major
event
.

Importantly
,
exercises
bring
together
individuals
representing
organisations
with
different
roles
and
perspectives
allowing
identification
of
capabilities
and
limitations
,
and
problem
solving
about
how
to
address
the
gaps
and
overlaps
in
a
low-threat
collaborative
setting
.

Respiratory
infectious
disease
epidemics
and
pandemics
are
recurring
events
that
levy
a
high
cost
on
individuals
and
society
.

The
health-protective
behavioral
response
of
the
public
plays
an
important
role
in
limiting
respiratory
infectious
disease
spread
.

Health-protective
behaviors
take
several
forms
.

Behaviors
can
be
categorized
as
pharmaceutical
(
e.g.
,
vaccination
uptake
,
antiviral
use
)
or
non-pharmaceutical
(
e.g.
,
hand
washing
,
face
mask
use
,
avoidance
of
public
transport
)
.

Due
to
the
limitations
of
pharmaceutical
interventions
during
respiratory
epidemics
and
pandemics
,
public
health
campaigns
aimed
at
limiting
disease
spread
often
emphasize
both
non-pharmaceutical
and
pharmaceutical
behavioral
interventions
.

Understanding
the
determinants
of
the
public
's
behavioral
response
is
crucial
for
devising
public
health
campaigns
,
providing
information
to
parametrize
mathematical
models
,
and
ultimately
limiting
disease
spread
.

While
other
reviews
have
qualitatively
analyzed
the
body
of
work
on
demographic
determinants
of
health-protective
behavior
,
this
meta-analysis
quantitatively
combines
the
results
from
85
publications
to
determine
the
global
relationship
between
gender
and
health-protective
behavioral
response
.

The
results
show
that
women
in
the
general
population
are
about
50
%
more
likely
than
men
to
adopt/
practice
non-pharmaceutical
behaviors
.

Conversely
,
men
in
the
general
population
are
marginally
(
about
12
%
)
more
likely
than
women
to
adopt/practice
pharmaceutical
behaviors
.

It
is
possible
that
factors
other
than
pharmaceutical/non-pharmaceutical
status
not
included
in
this
analysis
act
as
moderators
of
this
relationship
.

These
results
suggest
an
inherent
difference
in
how
men
and
women
respond
to
epidemic
and
pandemic
respiratory
infectious
diseases
.

This
information
can
be
used
to
target
specific
groups
when
developing
non-pharmaceutical
public
health
campaigns
and
to
parameterize
epidemic
models
incorporating
demographic
information
.

Background
:
While
trust
in
physicians
has
been
rigorously
investigated
regarding
its
concept
,
measurement
,
and
factors
,
the
studies
have
mainly
focused
on
the
attributes
of
the
physicians
.

This
approach
can
lead
to
a
limited
understanding
of
trust
in
physicians
as
trust
is
based
on
the
relationship
,
an
interaction
of
both
parties
:
patients
and
physicians
.

This
study
aimed
to
investigate
the
factors
for
trust
in
physicians
among
the
Koreans
by
focusing
on
patients
'
traits
which
are
related
to
their
subjective
perceptions
.

Methods
:
A
web-based
survey
was
conducted
between
August
and
September
2016
among
1000
Korean
adults
aged
18
to
59
years
.

Survey
participants
were
selected
by
a
proportionate
quota
sampling
based
on
age
,
sex
and
place
of
residence
.

The
t-test
and
analysis
of
variance
(
ANOVA
)
were
performed
to
examine
the
difference
in
trust
in
physicians
among
the
different
groups
in
each
variable
of
patient
characteristics
.

An
ordinal
logistic
regression
model
was
employed
to
examine
the
association
between
trust
in
physicians
and
patient
attributes
.

Results
:
Negative
health-related
traits
,
such
as
stress
and
low
self-rated
health
,
were
likely
to
lower
trust
in
physicians
,
and
women
were
less
likely
to
trust
physicians
.

The
negative
attitudes
toward
the
current
health
care
system
were
strongly
associated
with
low
trust
in
physicians
.

Meanwhile
,
recent
experience
of
hospitalization
or
outpatient
visit
was
positively
associated
with
trust
in
physicians
,
and
experience
of
not
being
able
to
use
health
facilities
showed
no
significant
association
.

These
results
suggest
that
trust
in
physicians
is
more
likely
to
be
lowered
by
negative
perception
than
by
the
objective
conditions
or
experience
.

Conclusion
:
In
investigating
the
factors
for
trust
in
physicians
,
the
patients
'
predispositions
,
which
make
them
less
likely
to
trust
physicians
,
should
be
considered
.

The
attributes
of
the
patients
in
Korea
,
which
could
negatively
affect
trust
in
physicians
,
need
to
be
investigated
in
consideration
of
the
recent
changes
in
patient-physician
relationships
and
the
medical
environment
in
Korea

YopH
is
a
bacterial
protein
tyrosine
phosphatase
,
which
is
essential
for
the
viability
and
pathogenic
virulence
of
the
plague-causing
Yersinia
sp
.

bacteria
.

Inactivation
of
YopH
activity
would
lead
to
the
loss
of
bacterial
pathogenicity
.

We
have
studied
the
inhibitory
properties
of
aurintricarboxylic
acid
(
ATA
)
against
YopH
phosphatase
and
found
that
at
nanomolar
concentrations
ATA
reversibly
decreases
the
activity
of
YopH
.

Computational
docking
studies
indicated
that
in
all
binding
poses
ATA
binds
in
the
YopH
active
site
.

Molecular
dynamics
simulations
showed
that
in
the
predicted
binding
pose
,
ATA
binds
to
the
essential
Cys403
and
Arg409
residues
in
the
active
site
and
has
a
stronger
binding
affinity
than
the
natural
substrate
(
pTyr
)
.

The
cyclic
voltammetry
experiments
suggest
that
ATA
reacts
remarkably
strongly
with
molecular
oxygen
.

Additionally
,
the
electrochemical
reduction
of
ATA
in
the
presence
of
a
negative
potential
from
-2.0
to
2.5
V
generates
a
current
signal
,
which
is
observed
for
hydrogen
peroxide
.

Here
we
showed
that
ATA
indicates
a
unique
mechanism
of
YopH
inactivation
due
to
a
redox
process
.

We
proposed
that
the
potent
inhibitory
properties
of
ATA
are
a
result
of
its
strong
binding
in
the
YopH
active
site
and
in
situ
generation
of
hydrogen
peroxide
near
catalytic
cysteine
residue
.

Purpose
of
Review-Interferon-induced
transmembrane
protein
3
(
IFITM3
)
is
a
cellular
restriction
factor
that
blocks
fusion
between
virus
and
host
membranes
.

Here
,
we
provide
an
introduction
to
IFITM3
and
the
biochemical
regulation
underlying
its
antiviral
activity
.

Further
,
we
analyze
and
summarize
the
published
literature
examining
phenotypes
of
IFITM3
knockout
mice
upon
infections
with
viral
pathogens
and
discuss
the
controversial
association
between
single
nucleotide
polymorphisms
(
SNPs
)
in
the
human
IFITM3
gene
and
severe
virus
infections
.

Recent
Findings-Recent
publications
show
that
IFITM3
knockout
mice
experience
more
severe
pathologies
than
wild-type
mice
in
diverse
virus
infections
,
including
infections
with
influenza
A
virus
,
West
Nile
virus
,
Chikungunya
virus
,
Venezuelan
equine
encephalitis
virus
,
respiratory
syncytial
virus
,
and
cytomegalovirus
.

Likewise
,
numerous
studies
of
humans
of
Chinese
ancestry
have
associated
the
IFITM3
SNP
rs12252-C
with
severe
influenza
virus
infections
,
though
examinations
of
other
populations
,
such
as
Europeans
,
in
which
this
SNP
is
rare
,
have
largely
failed
to
identify
an
association
with
severe
infections
.

A
second
SNP
,
rs34481144-A
,
found
in
the
human
IFITM3
promoter
has
also
recently
been
reported
to
be
a
risk
allele
for
severe
influenza
virus
infections
.

Summary-There
is
significant
evidence
for
a
protective
role
of
IFITM3
against
virus
infections
in
both
mice
and
humans
,
though
additional
work
is
required
to
identify
the
range
of
pathogens
restricted
by
IFITM3
and
the
mechanisms
by
which
human
SNPs
affect
IFITM3
levels
or
functionality
.

Virions
are
one
kind
of
nanoscale
pathogen
and
are
able
to
infect
living
cells
of
animals
,
plants
,
and
bacteria
.

The
infection
is
an
intrinsic
property
of
the
virions
,
and
the
biological
process
provides
a
good
model
for
studying
how
these
nanoparticles
enter
into
cells
.

During
the
infection
,
the
viruses
employ
different
strategies
to
which
the
cells
have
developed
respective
responses
.

For
this
paper
,
we
chose
Bombyx
mori
cypovirus
1
(
BmCPV-1
)
interactions
with
midgut
cells
from
silkworm
,
and
severe
acute
respiratory
syndrome
(
SARS
)
associated
coronavirus
interactions
with
Vero
E6
cells
,
as
examples
to
demonstrate
the
response
of
eukaryotic
cells
to
two
different
types
of
virus
from
our
previous
studies
.

The
bacteriophage-bacteria
interactions
are
also
introduced
to
elucidate
how
the
bacteriophage
conquers
the
barrier
of
cell
walls
in
the
prokaryotic
cells
to
transport
genome
into
the
host
.

Background
:
Porcine
parvovirus
(
PPV
)
infection
primarily
causes
reproductive
failure
of
pregnant
swine
and
results
in
host
cell
death
.

Boars
,
as
an
important
disseminator
,
shed
PPV
to
sows
via
semen
.

PPV
infects
and
numerously
replicates
in
boar
testicle
,
which
results
in
damage
of
swine
testicle
in
vivo
.

Reactive
oxygen
species
(
ROS
)
,
a
mediator
of
cell
apoptosis
,
play
a
crucial
role
in
the
mitochondria
apoptotic
pathway
.

However
,
whether
PPV
infection
induces
ST
cells
apoptosis
and
ROS
accumulation
is
still
unclear
.

Methods
:
To
determine
the
effects
of
PPV
infection
on
the
apoptosis
,
we
detected
morphological
changes
,
DNA
ladder
,
activities
of
caspases
,
and
expression
of
PARP
in
PPV-infected
ST
cells
.

Moreover
,
aiming
to
investigate
the
effect
of
PPV
infection
on
the
mitochondrial
apoptotic
pathway
and
ROS
accumulation
,
we
detected
the
Δψm
,
apoptosis-related
genes
,
and
ROS
.

To
investigate
the
role
of
ROS
in
the
process
of
PPV-induced
apoptosis
,
the
ST
cells
were
infected
with
PPV
and
treated
with
the
ROS
antioxidants
.

The
ROS
level
was
measured
using
Reactive
Oxygen
Species
Assay
Kit
and
the
Δψm
,
expression
level
of
Bcl-2
,
translocation
of
Bax
,
and
redistribution
of
mitochondria
cytochrome
c
were
tested
.

In
this
study
,
we
demonstrated
that
PPV
infection
could
induce
apoptosis
that
was
characterized
by
morphological
changes
,
DNA
fragmentation
and
activation
of
caspases
.

Moreover
,
PPV
infection
suppressed
Bcl-2
expression
,
enhanced
Bax
expression
and
translocation
to
mitochondria
,
decreased
the
mitochondrial
transmembrane
potential
,
and
triggered
the
release
of
cytochrome
c
,
which
caused
the
subsequent
activation
of
caspase-9
and
caspase-3
and
initiation
of
apoptosis
.

However
,
during
the
process
of
PPV-induced
apoptosis
,
the
protein
levels
of
Fas
and
FasL
were
not
affected
.

Further
studies
showed
that
PPV
infection
caused
ROS
accumulation
.

Inhibition
of
ROS
could
reduce
mitochondrial
transmembrane
potential
and
could
significantly
block
ST
cells
apoptosis
via
suppressing
Bax
translocation
,
cytochrome
c
and
caspase-3
activation
.

Conclusions
:
All
these
results
suggest
that
PPV-induced
ROS
accumulation
mediates
apoptosis
in
ST
cells
,
which
provided
theoretical
basis
for
the
molecular
pathogenesis
of
PPV
infection
.

Up
to

,
there
have
been
77,269
officially

of
2019
novel

Circulatory
dysfunction
is
considered
to
have
a
late
onset
in
severe
cases
of
nCoV
pneumonia
,
which
is
often
ignored
in
clinical
treatment
.

The
main
causes
of
acute
respiratory
failure
and
subsequent
circulatory
dysfunction
include
the
rapid
progress
of
lung
injury
,
fluid
overload
,
lung
consolidation
,
and
mechanical
ventilation
for
hypoxemia
.

Most
injuries
are
related
to
fluid
overload
,
acute
lung
injury
,
and
longterm
hypoxia
.

Echocardiographic
is
an
important
part
of
critical
ultrasonography
,
which
helps
to
quickly
identify
the
hemodynamic
status
.

We
summarized
the
echocardiographic
features
of
critically
ill
COVID-19
patients
and
its
clinical
use
in
the
treatment
of

pneumonia
.

The
echocardiographic
features
of
COVID-19
are
mainly
related
to
the
severity
of
disease
and
cardiovascular
complications
.

Abnormal

,
with/without
the

,
which
is
often
seen
in
the

,
leading
to
the

and
``
external

(
including
fluid

,
which
causes
the

,
which
affects
the
cardiac

;
further
,
LV
function
will
be
affected
because
the
right

are
in
the

pericardium
;
and
(

,
which
is

.

The

of

and
their
probable

Echocardiography
can
help
to

understand
the

and
help

The
new
porcine
epidemic
diarrhea
(
PED
)
has
caused
devastating
economic
losses
to
the
swine
industry
worldwide
.

Despite
extensive
research
on
the
relationship
between
autophagy
and
virus
infection
,
the
concrete
role
of
autophagy
in
porcine
epidemic
diarrhea
virus
(
PEDV
)
infection
has
not
been
reported
.

In
this
study
,
autophagy
was
demonstrated
to
be
triggered
by
the
effective
replication
of
PEDV
through
transmission
electron
microscopy
,
confocal
microscopy
,
and
Western
blot
analysis
.

Moreover
,
autophagy
was
confirmed
to
benefit
PEDV
replication
by
using
autophagy
regulators
and
RNA
interference
.

Furthermore
,
autophagy
might
be
associated
with
the
expression
of
inflammatory
cytokines
and
have
a
positive
feedback
loop
with
the
NF-κB
signaling
pathway
during
PEDV
infection
.

This
work
is
the
first
attempt
to
explore
the
complex
interplay
between
autophagy
and
PEDV
infection
.

Our
findings
might
accelerate
our
understanding
of
the
pathogenesis
of
PEDV
infection
and
provide
new
insights
into
the
development
of
effective
therapeutic

of

damaged
organelles
are
delivered
to
lysosomes
for
degradation
and
recycling
[

,

]
.

Autophagy
can
be
induced
by
diverse
intracellular
and
extracellular
stimuli
,
such
as
nutrient
starvation
,
endoplasmic
reticulum
(
ER
)
stress
,
pathogen-associated
molecular
patterns
(
PAMPs
)
,
and
virus
infection
[

]
.

Increasing
evidence
indicates
that
autophagy
plays
both
anti-viral
and
pro-viral
roles
in
the
life
cycles
and
pathogenesis
of
a
broad
range
of
viruses
[

]
.

Specifically
,
autophagy
is
an
intrinsic
host
defense
mechanism
that
inhibits
viral
replication
or
eliminates
viruses
by
delivering
them
to
the
lysosomal
compartment
for
degradation
.

Meanwhile
,
viruses
develop
many
mechanisms
to
block
autophagy
or
even
hijack
it
for
their
own
benefit
,
such
as
human
cytomegalovirus
(
HCMV
)
and
herpes
simplex
virus
type
1
(
HSV-1
)
[

,
[
12
]
[
13
]
[
14
]
.

However
,
autophagy
is
also
believed
to
serve
as
a
platform
for
viral
replication
,
especially
for
RNA
viruses
,
such
as
classical
swine
fever
virus
(
CSFV
)
,
porcine
reproductive
and
respiratory
syndrome
virus
(
PRRSV
)
,
and
rotavirus
(
RV
)
,
utilizing
the
membranes
of
the
autophagosome-like
vesicles
for
their
replication
[
15
]
[
16
]
[
17
]
.

These
polar
characteristics
reveal
the
complicated
relationship
between
autophagy
and
viral
infection
.

A
previous
proteomic
study
indicated
that
more
differentially
expressed
proteins
were
mapped
to
the
autophagy
pathway
,
and
the
microtubule-associated
protein
1B
,
a
useful
biomarker
protein
for
autophagy
was
up-regulated
in
PEDV-infected
Vero
cells
[
18
]
.

In
addition
,
our
previous
study
demonstrated
that
mTOR
(
the
mammalian
target
of
rapamycin
)
pathway
,
which
was
closely
associated
with
cellular
autophagy
,
was
down-regulated
,
and
that
the
autophagy
associated
protein
ATG5
was
up-regulated
during
PEDV
infection
[
19
]
.

These
studies
indicated
that
autophagy
might
participate
in
PEDV
infection
,
but
the
specific
function
of
autophagy
in
the
process
of
PEDV
infection
has
not
been
elucidated
.

In
the
present
study
,
we
demonstrated
for
the
first
time
that
autophagy
was
triggered
in
Vero
cells
during
PEDV
infection
to
promote
its
replication
.

Moreover
,
autophagy
might
mediate
the
inflammatory
responses
induced
by
PEDV
infection
and
have
a
positive
correlation
with
the
NF-κB
signaling
pathway

The
recent
spread
of
Zika
virus
(
ZIKV
)
and
its
association
with
increased
rates
of
Guillain
Barre
and
other
neurological
disorders
as
well
as
congenital
defects
that
include
microcephaly
has
created
an
urgent
need
to
develop
animal
models
to
examine
the
pathogenesis
of
the
disease
and
explore
the
efficacy
of
potential
therapeutics
and

.

Recently
developed
infection
models
for
ZIKV
utilize
mice
defective
in
interferon
responses
.

In
this
study
we
establish
and
characterize
a
new
model
of
peripheral
ZIKV
infection
using
immunocompetent
neonatal
C57BL/6
mice
and
compare
its
clinical
progression
,

distribution
,
immune
response
,
and
neuropathology
with
that
of
C57BL/6-IFNAR
KO
mice
.

We
show
that
while
ZIKV
infected
IFNAR
KO
mice
develop
bilateral
hind
limb
paralysis
and
die
5-6
days
post-infection
(
dpi
)
,
immunocompetent
B6
WT
mice
develop
signs
of
neurological
disease
including
unsteady
gait
,
kinetic
tremors
,
severe
ataxia
and
seizures
by
13

that
subside
gradually
over

Immunohistochemistry
show
viral
antigen
predominantly
in
cerebellum
at
the
peak
of
the
disease
in
both
models
.

However
,
whereas
IFNAR
KO
mice
showed
infiltration
by
neutrophils
and
macrophages
and
higher
expression
of
IL-1
,
IL-6
and
Cox2
,
B6
WT
mice
show
a
cellular
infiltration
in
the
CNS
composed
predominantly
of
T
cells
,
particularly
CD8+
T
cells
,
and
increased
mRNA
expression
levels
of
IFNg
,
GzmB
and
Prf1
at
peak
of
disease
.

Lastly
,
the
CNS
of
B6
WT
mice
shows
evidence
of
neurodegeneration
predominantly
in
the
cerebellum
that
are
less
prominent
in
mice
lacking
the
IFN
response
possibly
due
to
the
difference
in
cellular
infiltrates
and
rapid
progression
of
the
disease
in
that
model
.

The
development
of
the
B6
WT
model
of
ZIKV
infection
will
provide
insight
into
the
immunopathology

The

(

)
and
its

with
increased

of

created
an

examine
the
pathogenesis
of
the

and
explore
the

.

We
describe
the
first
symptomatic
PRVABC59
(
ZIKV
)
animal
model
in
immunocompetent
B6
WT
mice
showing
that
a
subcutaneous
challenge
in
1
day
old
mice
leads
to
non-lethal
neurological
disease
that
is
characterized
by
unsteady
gait
,
kinetic
tremors
,
severe
ataxia
and
seizures
that
subsides
after
2
weeks
.

ZIKV
infects
neurons
in
cerebellum
of
mice
and
elicits
the
infiltration
of
lymphocytes
into
the
brain
.

The
immune
response
protects
mice
from
death
but
may
also
contribute
to
neurodegeneration
as
mice
with
defective
interferon
responses
have
increased
virus
loads
in
brain
and
peripheral
organs
,
succumbing
to
the
disease
in
5-6
days
,
but
have
fewer
signs
of
neurodegeneration
.

This
mouse
model
bypasses
transplacental
transmission
and
consequent
placental
insufficiency
and
will
facilitate
detailed
investigations
into
the
pathogenesis
of
the
disease
as
well
as
mechanistic
studies
for
possible
therapeutics
and
vaccines
.

Lastly
,
its
non-lethal
outcome
allows
for
studies
assessing
the
long
term
effects
of
the
infection
,
and
exploring
conditions
that
could
lead

known
to
be

We
need
to
develop
a
new
type
vaccine
based
on
RBDs
.

In
this
study
,
we
expressed
and
purified
recombinant
proteins
(
named
RBD-TcdA
and
RBD-TcdB
)
as

candidates

,
respectively
,
from

The
immunogenicity
and
protection
of
the
vaccine
candidates
RBD-TcdA
,
RBD-TcdB
,
and
RBD-TcdA/B
was
evaluated
by
ELISA
and
survival
assays
.

The
data
indicated
that
mice
immunized
with
all
vaccine
candidates
displayed
potent
levels
of
RBD-specific
serum
IgG
.

Following
intramuscular
immunization
of
mice
with
RBD-TcdA
and/or
RBD-TcdB
,
these
vaccine
candidates
triggered
immune
responses
that
protected
mice
compared
to
mice
immunized
with
aluminum
hydroxide
alone
.

Taken
together
,
the
results
of
this
study
reveal
that
recombinant
proteins
containing
RBDs
of
C.
difficile
toxins
can
be
used
for
vaccine
development
.

Additionally
,
we
found
that
an
RBD-TcdA/B
vaccine
can
elicit
a
stronger
humoral
immune
response
and
provide
better
immunoprotection
than
the
univalent
vaccines
.

This
RBD
vaccine
candidate
conferred
significant
protection

Neurotropic
herpesviruses
can
establish
lifelong
infection
in
humans
and
contribute
to
severe
diseases
including
encephalitis
and
neurodegeneration
.

However
,
the
mechanisms
through
which
the
brain
's
immune
system
recognizes
and
controls
viral
infections
propagating
across
synaptically
linked
neuronal
circuits
have
remained
unclear
.

Using
a
well-established
model
of
alphaherpesvirus
infection
that
reaches
the
brain
exclusively
via
retrograde
transsynaptic
spread
from
the
periphery
,
and
in
vivo
two-photon
imaging
combined
with
high
resolution
microscopy
,
we
show
that
microglia
are
recruited
to
and
isolate
infected
neurons
within
hours
.

Selective
elimination
of
microglia
results
in
a
marked
increase
in
the
spread
of
infection
and
egress
of
viral
particles
into
the
brain
parenchyma
,
which
are
associated
with
diverse
neurological
symptoms
.

Microglia
recruitment
and
clearance
of
infected
cells
require
cell-autonomous
P2Y12
signalling
in
microglia
,
triggered
by
nucleotides
released
from
affected
neurons
.

In
turn
,
we
identify
microglia
as
key
contributors
to
monocyte
recruitment
into
the
inflamed
brain
,
which
process
is
largely
independent
of
P2Y12
.

P2Y12-positive
microglia
are
also
recruited
to
infected
neurons
in
the
human
brain
during
viral
encephalitis
and
both
microglial
responses
and
leukocyte
numbers
correlate
with
the
severity
of
infection
.

Thus
,
our
data
identify
a
key
role
for
microglial
P2Y12
in
defence
against
neurotropic
viruses
,
whilst
P2Y12independent
actions
of
microglia
may
contribute
to
neuroinflammation
by
facilitating
monocyte
recruitment
to
the
sites
of
infection

Traditional
textbook
explanatory
paradigm
of
rapid
mutation
of
retroviruses
can
not
adequately
address
the
unavailability
of
vaccine
for
many
sexually
transmissible
viruses
,
since
HSV
and
HCV
are
DNA
and
non-retroviral
RNA
viruses
,
respectively
,
whereas
effective
vaccine
for
the
horsefly-transmitted
retroviral
cousin
of
HIV
,
equine
infectious
anemia
virus
(
EIAV
)
,
was
found
in
1973
.

We
reported
earlier
the
highly
disordered
nature
of
proteins
in
outer
shells
of
the
HIV
,
HCV
,
and
HSV
.

Such
levels
of
disorder
are
completely
absent
among
the
classical
viruses
,
such
as
smallpox
,
rabies
,
yellow
fever
,
and
polio
viruses
,
for
which
efficient
vaccines
were
discovered
.

This
review
analyzes
the
physiology
and
shell
disorder
of
the
various
related
and
non-related
viruses
to
argue
that
EIAV
and
the
classical
viruses
need
harder
shells
to
survive
during
harsher
conditions
of
non-sexual
transmissions
,
thus
making
them
vulnerable
to
antibody
detection
and
neutralization
.

In
contrast
,
the
outer
shell
of
the
HIV-1
(
with
its
preferential
sexual
transmission
)
is
highly
disordered
,
thereby
allowing
large
scale
motions
of
its
surface
glycoproteins
and
making
it
difficult
for
antibodies
to
bind
to
them
.

The
theoretical
underpinning
of
this
concept
is
retrospectively
traced
to
a
classical
1920s
experiment
by
the
legendary
scientist
,
Oswald
Avery
.

This
concept
of
viral
shapeshifting
has
implications
for
improved
treatment
of
cancer
and
infections
via
immune
evasion

.

Clinical
performance
of
the
reagent
on
the
two
systems
was
evaluated
by
testing
60
human
serum

.

Both

detected
the

samples
(

,

,

was
found
between

RIG-I-like
receptors
(
RLRs
)
play
important
roles
in
response
to
virus
infection
by
regulating
host
innate
immune
signaling
pathways
.

Meanwhile
,
the
RLR
signaling
pathway
is
also
tightly
regulated
by
host
and
virus
to
achieve
the
immune
homeostasis
between
antiviral
responses
and
virus
survival
.

Here
,
we
found
that
zebrafish
TRIM25
(
zbTRIM25
)
functioned
as
a
positive
regulator
of
RLR
signaling
pathway
during
red
spotted
grouper
nervous
necrosis
virus
(
RGNNV
)
infection
.

Post-RGNNV
infection
,
zbTRIM25
expression
was
obviously
inhibited
and
ectopic
expression
of
zbTRIM25
led
to
enhanced
expression
of
RLR
signaling
pathway-related
genes
.

Overexpression
and
knockdown
analysis
revealed
that
zbTRIM25
promoted
zebrafish
RIG-I
(
zbRIG-I
)
-mediated
IFN
signaling
and
inhibited
RGNNV
replication
.

Mechanistically
,
zbTRIM25
bound
to
zbRIG-I
;
in
particular
,
the
SPRY
domain
of
zbTRIM25
interacted
with
the
tandem
caspase
activation
and
recruitment
domains
(
2CARD
)
and
repressor
domain
(
RD
)
regions
of
zbRIG-I
.

zbTRIM25
promoted
the
K63
polyubiquitination
of
2CARD
and
RD
regions
of
zbRIG-I
.

Furthermore
,
zbTRIM25-mediated
zbRIG-I
activation
of
IFN
production
was
enhanced
by
K63-linked
ubiquitin
,
indicating
that
zbTRIM25-mediated
zbRIG-I
polyubiquitination
was
essential
for
RIG-I-triggered
IFN
induction
.

In
conclusion
,
these
findings
reveal
a
novel
mechanism
that
zbTRIM25
positively
regulates
the
innate
immune
response
by
targeting
and
promoting
the
K63-linked
polyubiquitination
of
zbRIG-I
.

Background
:
Master
of
Public
Health
programs
have
been
developed
across
Canada
in
response
to
the
need
for
graduate-level
trained
professionals
to
work
in
the
public
health
sector
.

The
University
of
Guelph
recently
conducted
a
five-year
outcome
assessment
using
the
Core
Competencies
for
Public
Health
in
Canada
as
an
evaluative
framework
to
determine
whether
graduates
are
receiving
adequate
training
,
and
identify
areas
for
improvement
.

Methods
:
A
curriculum
map
of
core
courses
and
an
online
survey
of
University
of
Guelph
Master
of
Public
Health
graduates
comprised
the
outcome
assessment
.

The
curriculum
map
was
constructed
by
evaluating
course
outlines
,
assignments
,
and
content
to
determine
the
extent
to
which
the
Core
Competencies
were
covered
in
each
course
.

Quantitative
survey
results
were
characterized
using
descriptive
statistics
.

Qualitative
survey
results
were
analyzed
to
identify
common
themes
and
patterns
in
open-ended
responses
.

Results
:
The
University
of
Guelph
Master
of
Public
Health
program
provided
a
positive
learning
environment
in
which
graduates
gained
proficiency
across
the
Core
Competencies
through
core
and
elective
courses
,
meaningful
practicums
,
and
competent
faculty
.

Practice-based
learning
environments
,
particularly
in
collaboration
with
public
health
organizations
,
were
deemed
to
be
beneficial
to
students
'
learning
experiences
.

Conclusions
:
The
Core
Competencies
and
graduate
surveys
can
be
used
to
conduct
a
meaningful
and
informative
outcome
assessment
.

We
encourage
other
Master
of
Public
Health
programs
to
conduct
their
own
outcome
assessments
using
a
similar
framework
,
and
disseminate
these
results
in
order
to
identify
best
practices
and
strengthen
the
Canadian
graduate
public
health
education
system
.

Specific
cleavage
of
proteins
by
proteases
is
essential
for
several
cellular
,
physiological
,
and
viral
processes
.

Chymotrypsin-related
proteases
that
form
the
PA
clan
in
the
MEROPS
classification
of
proteases
is
one
of
the
largest
and
most
diverse
group
of
proteases
.

The
PA
clan
comprises
serine
proteases
from
bacteria
,
eukaryotes
,
archaea
,
and
viruses
and
chymotrypsin-related
cysteine
proteases
from
positive-strand
RNA
viruses
.

Despite
low
amino
acid
sequence
identity
,
all
PA
clan
proteases
share
a
conserved
double
β-barrel
structure
.

Using
an
automated
structure-based
hierarchical
clustering
method
,
we
identified
a
common
structural
core
of
72
amino
acid
residues
for
143
PA
clan
proteases
that
represent
12
protein
families
and
11
subfamilies
.

The
identified
core
is
located
around
the
catalytic
site
between
the
two
β-barrels
and
resembles
the
structures
of
the
smallest
PA
clan
proteases
.

We
constructed
a
structure-based
distance
tree
derived
from
the
properties
of
the
identified
common
core
.

Our
structure-based
analyses
support
the
current
classification
of
these
proteases
at
the
subfamily
level
and
largely
at
the
family
level
.

Structural
alignment
and
structure-based
distance
trees
could
thus
be
used
for
directing
objective
classification
of
PA
clan
proteases
and
to
strengthen
their
higher
order
classification
.

Our
results
also
indicate
that
the
PA
clan
proteases
of
positive-strand
RNA
viruses
are
related
to
cellular
heatshock
proteases
,
which
suggests
that
the
exchange
of
protease
genes
between
viruses
and
cells
might
have
occurred
more
than
once
.

The

The

Porcine
reproductive
and
respiratory
syndrome
(
PRRS
)
has
been
one
of
the
most
economically
important
diseases
affecting
swine
industry
worldwide
and
causes
great
economic
losses
each
year
.

PRRS
virus
(
PRRSV
)
replicates
mainly
in
porcine
alveolar
macrophages
(
PAMs
)
and
dendritic
cells
(
DCs
)
and
develops
persistent
infections
,
antibody-dependent
enhancement
(
ADE
)
,
interstitial
pneumonia
and
immunosuppression
.

But
the
molecular
mechanisms
of
PRRSV
infection
still
are
poorly
understood
.

Here
we
report
on
the
first
genome-wide
host
transcriptional
responses
to
classical
North
American
type

analyse
systematically
the
relationship
between
pulmonary
gene
expression
profiles
after
N-PRRSV
infection
and
infection
pathology
.

Our
results
suggest
that
N-PRRSV
appeared
to
utilize
multiple
strategies
for
its
replication
and
spread
in
infected
pigs
,
including
subverting
host
innate
immune
response
,
inducing
an
anti-apoptotic
and
anti-inflammatory
state
as
well
as
developing
ADE
.

Upregulation
expression
of
virus-induced
pro-inflammatory
cytokines
,
chemokines
,
adhesion
molecules
and
inflammatory
enzymes
and
inflammatory
cells
,
antibodies
,
complement
activation
were
likely
to
result
in
the
development
of
inflammatory
responses
during
N-PRRSV
infection
processes
.

N-PRRSV-induced
immunosuppression
might
be
mediated
by
apoptosis
of
infected
cells
,
which
caused
depletion
of
immune
cells
and
induced
an
anti-inflammatory
cytokine
response
in
which
they
were
unable
to
eradicate
the
primary
infection
.

Our
systems

will
benefit
for
better
understanding
the
molecular
pathogenesis

N-PRRSV
infection

developing
novel

Background
:
The

was
to
assess
the
burden
of

outcome
.

Methods
:
A
multicenter
cross-sectional
study
,
involving
27
referral
maternity
hospitals
in
five
Brazilian
regions
.

Cases
were
identified
in
a
prospective
surveillance
by
using
the
WHO
standardized
criteria
for
potentially
life-threatening
conditions
(

cases
of
H1N1
influenza

were
compared
to
those
with
other
causes
of
severe

Results
:
Among
9555
cases
of

morbidity
,
485
(

Perinatal
outcome
was
worse
in

Conclusions
:
Respiratory
disease
,
especially
considering
the
influenza
season
,
is
a
very
severe
cause
of
maternal
near

and
death
.

Increased
awareness
about
this
condition
,
preventive
vaccination
during
pregnancy
,
early
diagnosis
and
treatment
are
required
to
improve
maternal
health
.

of
clinical
case
definitions
.

We
analysed
130
community-ARI
and
140
inpatient-ARI
episodes
(
5
inpatient-ARI
excluded
because
multiple
pathogens
were
detected
)
,
involving
138
and
207
samples
respectively
.

Detection
by
PCR
declined
with
days
post-onset
for
influenza
virus
;
decrease
was
faster
for
community-ARI
than
for
inpatient-ARI
.

No
such
patterns
were
observed
for
noninfluenza
respiratory
virus
infections
.

PathChip
added
substantially
to
viruses
detected
for
community-ARI
only
.

Clinical
case
definitions
discriminated
influenza
from
other
mild-ARI
but
performed
poorly
for
severe-ARI
and
for
older
participants
.

Rational
strategies
for
diagnosis
and
surveillance
of
influenza
and
other
respiratory
virus
must
acknowledge
the
differences
between
ARIs
presenting
in
community
and
hospital
settings
.

Background
:
There
are
two
biotypes
of
feline
coronavirus
(
FCoV
)
:
the
self-limiting
feline
enteric
coronavirus
(
FECV
)
and
the
feline
infectious
peritonitis
virus
(
FIPV
)
,
which
causes
feline
infectious
peritonitis
(
FIP
)
,
a
fatal
disease
associated
with
cats
living
in
multi-cat
environments
.

This
study
provides
an
insight
on
the
various
immune
mediators
detected
in
FCoV-positive
cats
which
may
be
responsible
for
the
development
of
FIP
.

Results
:
In
this
study
,
using
real-time
PCR
and
multiplex
bead-based
immunoassay
,
the
expression
profiles
of
several
immune
mediators
were
examined
in
Crandell-Reese
feline
kidney
(
CRFK
)
cells
infected
with
the
feline
coronavirus
(
FCoV
)
strain
FIPV
79-1146
and
in
samples
obtained
from
FCoV-positive
cats
.

CRFK
cells
infected
with
FIPV
79-1146
showed
an
increase
in
the
expression
of
interferon-related
genes
and
pro-inflammatory
cytokines
such
as
MX1
,
viperin
,
CXCL10
,
CCL8
,
RANTES
,
KC
,
MCP1
,
and
IL8
.

In
addition
,
an
increase
in
the
expression
of
the
above
cytokines
as
well
as
GM-CSF
and
IFNγ
was
also
detected
in
the
PBMC
,
serum
,
and
peritoneal
effusions
of
FCoV-positive
cats
.

Although
the
expression
of
MX1
and
viperin
genes
was
variable
between
cats
,
the
expression
of
these
two
genes
was
relatively
higher
in
cats
having
peritoneal
effusion
compared
to
cats
without
clinically
obvious
effusion
.

Higher
viral
load
was
also
detected
in
the
supernatant
of
peritoneal
effusions
compared
to
in
the
plasma
of
FCoV-positive
cats
.

As
expected
,
the
secretion
of
IL1β
,
IL6
and
TNFα
was
readily
detected
in
the
supernatant
of
peritoneal
effusions
of
the
FCoV-positive
cats
.

Conclusions
:
This
study
has
identified
various
pro-inflammatory
cytokines
and
interferon-related
genes
such
as
MX1
,
viperin
,
CXCL10
,
CCL8
,
RANTES
,
KC
,
MCP1
,
IL8
,
GM-CSF
and
IFNγ
in
FCoV-positive
cats
.

With
the
exception
of
MX1
and
viperin
,
no
distinct
pattern
of
immune
mediators
was
observed
that
distinguished
between
FCoV-positive
cats
with
and
without
peritoneal
effusion
.

Further
studies
based
on
definitive
diagnosis
of
FIP
need
to
be
performed
to
confirm
the
clinical
importance
of
this
study
.

Pharmacy
practice
research
(
PPR
)
is
a
specialty
field
within
the
wider
area
of
health
services
research
and
it
focuses
on
studies
of
how
and
why
people
access
pharmacy
services
.

This
stream
of
research
is
also
referred
to
as
more
universally
recognized
term
such
as
health
services
research
in
pharmacy
.

The
health
services
research
in
pharmacy
has
increased
manifold
;
however
,
the
impact
of
this
research
is
not
visible
at
the
global
level
.

The
editorial
explains
several
issues
on
quality
and
quantity
of
evidence
produced
including
how
evidence
produced
could
contribute
to
improve
quality
of
care
and
patients
'
health
outcomes
.

It
also
narrates
examples
from
the
UK
and
Australia
showing
how
health
services
research
in
pharmacy
has
made
an
impact
on
healthcare
service
delivery
.

The
editorial
argues
that
building
an
encyclopaedia
in
health
services
research
in
pharmacy
is
vital
to
enhance
the
visibility
and
impact
of
this
research
.

Infection
with
Middle
East
respiratory
syndrome
coronavirus
(
MERS-CoV
)
could
be
asymptomatic
or
cause
mild
influenza-like
illness
.

Therefore
,
the
prevalence
of
MERS-CoV
infections
in
the
general
population
could
be
underestimated
,
which
necessitates
active
surveillance
to
determine
the
epidemiological
importance
of
asymptomatic
cases
.

The
aim
of
this
study
is
to
evaluate
the
performance
of
various
serological
assays
and
to
estimate
the
seroprevalence
of
anti-MERS-CoV
antibodies
in
high-and
low-risk
groups
in
Qatar
.

A
total
of
4858
samples
were
screened
,
including
4719
samples
collected
from
healthy
blood
donors
(
BD
)
over
a
period
of
five
years
(
2012-2016
)
,
135
samples
from
baseline
case
contacts
(
CC
)
collected
from
individuals
in
close
contact
with
three
positive
PCR-confirmed
patients
(
CP
)
,
and
four
samples
from
MERS-CoV
CP
.

Initial
screening
using
anti-MERS-CoV
IgG
(
IgG
rS1-ELISA
kit
)
revealed
ten
reactive
samples
from
BD
(
10/4719
,
0.21
%
)
,
one
from
CC
(
1/135
,
0.74
%
)
,
and
three
from
CP
(
3/4
,
75
%
)
.

Samples
from
CP
but
not
from
BD
were
also
reactive
by
whole-virus
anti-MERS-CoV
IgG
(
n
=
3/4
)
and
IgM
(
n
=
1/4
)
indirect
immunefluorescent
tests
(
IIFT
)
and
pseudoparticle
neutralization
test
(
ppNT
)
.

The
reactive
sample
from
CC
was
also
confirmed
by
ppNT
.

Surprisingly
,
one
out
of
thirteen
(
7.7
%
)
randomly
selected
IgG
rS1-ELISA-negative
BD
samples
from
the
initial
screening
was
reactive
by
the
IgM-IIFT
(
but
not
by
the
IgG-IIFT
)
and
was
subsequently
confirmed
by
ppNT
.

All
IgG
rS1-ELISA-reactive
samples
from
BD
exhibited
considerable
reactivity
to
the
four
circulating
human
coronaviruses
(
HKU1
,
OC43
,
229E
,
and
NL63
)
.

Cross-reactivity
with
SARS
was
only
reported
for
samples
from
CP
using
IgG
and
IgM-IIFT
.

In
conclusion
,
we
report
a
low
prevalence
of
anti-MERS
antibodies
in
the
general
population
,
which
coincides
with
the
low
number
of
all
reported
cases
by
the
time
of
our
study
(
2017
)
in
Qatar
(
n
=
21
)
.

The
false-positive
results
and
the
observed
cross-reactivity
between
MERS-CoV
and
other
circulating
human
coronavirus
necessitate
more
detailed
evaluation
of
available
serological
assays
.

The
MIRACLE
trial
(
MERS-CoV
Infection
tReated
with
A
Combination
of
Lopinavir/ritonavir
and
intErferon-β1b
)
investigates
the
efficacy
of
a
combination
therapy
of
lopinavir/ritonavir
and
recombinant
interferon-β1b
provided
with
standard
supportive
care
,
compared
to
placebo
provided
with
standard
supportive
care
,
in
hospitalized
patients
with
laboratory-confirmed
MERS
.

The
MIRACLE
trial
is
designed
as
a
recursive
,
two-stage
,
group
sequential
,
multicenter
,
placebo-controlled
,
double-blind
randomized
controlled
trial
.

The
aim
of
this
article
is
to
describe
the
statistical
analysis
plan
for
the
MIRACLE
trial
.

The
primary
outcome
is
90-day
mortality
.

The
primary
analysis
will
follow
the
intention-to-treat
principle
.

The
MIRACLE
trial
is
the
first
randomized
controlled
trial
for
MERS
treatment
.

Multiple
subtypes
of
avian
influenza
(
AI
)
and
novel
reassortants
are
frequently
isolated
from
live
bird
markets
(
LBMs
)
.

However
,
our
understanding
of
the
drivers
of
persistence
of
multiple
AI
subtypes
is
limited
.

We
propose
a
stochastic
model
of
AI
transmission
within
an
LBM
that
incorporates
market
size
,
turnover
rate
and
the
balance
of
direct
versus
environmental
transmissibility
.

We
investigate
the
relationship
between
these
factors
and
the
critical
community
size
(
CCS
)
for
the
persistence
of
single
and
multiple
AI
strains
within
an
LBM
.

We
fit
different
models
of
seeding
from
farms
to
two-strain
surveillance
data
collected
from
Shantou
,
China
.

For
a
single
strain
and
plausible
estimates
for
continuous
turnover
rates
and
transmissibility
,
the
CCS
was
approximately
11
800
birds
,
only
a
4.2
%
increase
in
this
estimate
was
needed
to
ensure
persistence
of
the
co-infecting
strains
(
two
strains
in
a
single
host
)
.

Precise
values
of
CCS
estimates
were
sensitive
to
changes
in
market
turnover
rate
and
duration
of
the
latent
period
.

Assuming
a
gradual
daily
sell
rate
of
birds
the
estimated
CCS
was
higher
than
when
an
instantaneous
selling
rate
was
assumed
.

We
were
able
to
reproduce
prevalence
dynamics
similar
to
observations
from
a
single
market
in
China
with
infection
seeded
every
5-15
days
,
and
a
maximum
non-seeding
duration
of
80
days
.

Our
findings
suggest
that
persistence
of
co-infections
is
more
likely
to
be
owing
to
sequential
infection
of
single
strains
rather
than
ongoing
transmission
of
both
strains
concurrently
.

In
any
given
system
for
a
fixed
set
of
ecological
and
epidemiological
conditions
,
there
is
an
LBM
size
below
which
the
risk
of
sustained
co-circulation
is
low
and
which
may
suggest
a
clear
policy
opportunity
to
reduce
the
frequency
of
influenza
co-infection
in
poultry
.

Acute
gastroenteritis
(
AGE
)
is
a
common
illness
affecting
all
age
groups
worldwide
,
causing
an
estimated
three
million
deaths
annually
.

Viruses
such
as
rotavirus
,
adenovirus
,
and
caliciviruses
are
a
major
cause
of
AGE
,
but
in
many
patients
a
causal
agent
can
not
be
found
despite
extensive
diagnostic
testing
.

Proposing
that
novel
viruses
are
the
reason
for
this
diagnostic
gap
,
we
used
molecular
screening
to
investigate
a
cluster
of
undiagnosed
cases
that
were
part
of
a
larger
case
control
study
into
the
etiology
of
pediatric
AGE
.

Degenerate
oligonucleotide
primed
(
DOP
)
PCR
was
used
to
non-specifically
amplify
viral
DNA
from
fecal
specimens
.

The
amplified
DNA
was
then
cloned
and
sequenced
for
analysis
.

A
novel
virus
was
detected
.

Elucidation
and
analysis
of
the
genome
indicates
it
is
a
member
of
the
Bocavirus
genus
of
the
Parvovirinae
,
23
%
variant
at
the
nucleotide
level
from
its
closest
formally
recognized
relative
,
the
Human
Bocavirus
(
HBoV
)
,
and
similar
to
the
very
recently
proposed
second
species
of
Bocavirus
(
HBoV2
)
.

Fecal
samples
collected
from
case
control
pairs
during
2001
for
the
AGE
study
were
tested
with
a
bocavirus-specific
PCR
,
and
HBoV2
(
sequence
confirmed
)
was
detected
in
32
of
186
cases
with
AGE
(
prevalence
17.2
%
)
compared
with
only
15
controls
(
8.1
%
)
.

In
this
same
group
of
children
,
HBoV2
prevalence
was
exceeded
only
by
rotavirus
(
39.2
%
)
and
astrovirus
(
21.5
%
)
and
was
more
prevalent
than
norovirus
genogroup
2
(
13.4
%
)
and
adenovirus
(
4.8
%
)
.

In
a
univariate
analysis
of
the
matched
pairs
(
McNemar
's
Test
)
,
the
odds
ratio
for
the
association
of
AGE
with
HBoV2
infection
was
2.6
(
95
%
confidence
interval
1.2-5.7
)
;
P
=
0.007
.

During
the
course
of
this
screening
,
a
second
novel
bocavirus
was
detected
which
we
have
designated
HBoV
species
3
(
HBoV3
)
.

The
prevalence
of
HBoV3
was
low
(
2.7
%
)
,
and
it
was
not
associated
with
AGE
.

HBoV2
and
HBoV3
are
newly
discovered
bocaviruses
,
of
which
HBoV2
is
the
thirdmostprevalent
virus
,
after
rotavirus
and
astrovirus
,
associated
with
pediatric
AGE

this

Results
:
Most
cats
(
n
=
140
)
were
L.
infantum
antibody
negative
and
only
22
%
(
n
=
39
)
were
positive
.

Only
9
and
2
%
of
tested
cats
had
a
feline
immunodeficency
virus
(
FIV
)
infection
or
a
feline
leukemia
virus
(
FeLV
)
infection
,
respectively
.

Thirty-two
cats
out
of
179
(
18
%
)
produced
IFN-γ
after
stimulation
with
L.
infantum
soluble
antigen
(
LSA
)
while
the
majority
of
cats
(
93
%
)
produced
IFN-γ
after
stimulation
with
concanavalin
A
(
ConA
)
.

Six
LSA-IFN-γ-producer
cats
were
seropositive
(
three
to
ELISA
and
five
to
IFAT
)
but
they
were
polymerase
chain
reaction
(
PCR
)
negative
,
while
only
one
cat
was
antibody-and
PCR-positive
.

Significant
positive
correlations
were
found
between
IFN-γ
concentrations
after
stimulation
with
LSA
and
ConA
,
and
between
serology
and
PCR
testing
.

No
association
was
found
between
FIV
status
and
LSA
or
ConA-IFN-γ
production
.

Combining
PCR
,
serology
and
specific
IFN-γ
concentration
results
,
we
found
that
36
%
of
cats
studied
were
exposed
to
L.
infantum
.

As
expected
,
cats
from
endemic
areas
produce
IFN-γ
after
ex
vivo
blood
stimulation
with
LSA
and
therefore
are
able
to
activate
a
cell-mediated
adaptive
immune
response
against
the
parasite
that
is
variably
associated
with
antibody
or
blood
PCR
positivity
.

The
association
of
this
assay
to
serological
and
molecular
tests
provides
a
better
estimate
of
cat
exposure
to

.

Artificial
microRNA
(
amiRNA
)
-mediated
inhibition
of
viral
replication
has
recently
gained
importance
as
a
strategy
for
antiviral
therapy
.

In
this
study
,
we
evaluated
the
benefit
of
using
the
amiRNA
vector
against
Japanese
encephalitis
virus
(
JEV
)
.

We
designed
three
single
amiRNA
sequences
against
the
consensus
sequence
of
3¢
untranslated
region
(
3¢UTR
)
of
JEV
and
tested
their
efficacy
against
cell
culture-grown
JEV
Vellore
strain
(
P20778
)
in
neuronal
cells
.

The
binding
ability
of
three
amiRNAs
on
3¢UTR
region
was
tested
in
vitro
in
HEK293T
cells
using
a
JEV
3¢UTR
tagged
with
luciferase
reporter
vector
.

Transient
transfection
of
amiRNAs
was
nontoxic
to
cells
as
evident
from
the
MTT
assay
and
caused
minimal
induction
in
interferonstimulated
gene
expression
.

Furthermore
,
our
result
suggested
that
transient
expression
of
two
amiRNAs
(
amiRNA
#
1
and
amiRNA
#
2
)
significantly
reduced
intracellular
viral
RNA
and
nonstructural
1
(
NS1
)
protein
,
as
well
as
diminished
infectious
viral
particle
release
up
to
95
%
in
the
culture
supernatant
as
evident
from
viral
plaque
reduction
assay
.

Overall
,
our
results
indicated
that
RNA
interference
based
on
amiRNAs
targeting
viral
conserved
regions
at
3¢UTR
was
a
useful
approach
for
improvements
of
nucleic
acid
inhibitors
against
JEV
.

Background

On

(

were
collected
both
before
and
after
the
population
was
exposed

.

Results
:
On
Site
Two
,
pen
oral
fluid
samples
and
individual
pig
serum
samples
were
negative
for
both
PEDV
antibody
and
nucleic

.

On
Site
One
,
PEDV
was
detected
by
rRT-PCR
at
6
days
post
exposure
(
DPE
)
in
all
sample
types
.

The
last

were
detected
in

Analysis
of

showed
that
a

Conclusions
:
This
study
showed
that
oral
fluid-based
testing
could
provide
an
easy
and
``
animal-friendly
''
approach
to

Viroporins
are
a
family
of
low-molecular-weight
hydrophobic
transmembrane
proteins
that
are
encoded
by
various
animal
viruses
.

Viroporins
form
transmembrane
pores
in
host
cells
via
oligomerization
,
thereby
destroying
cellular
homeostasis
and
inducing
cytopathy
for
virus
replication
and
virion
release
.

Among
the
Picornaviridae
family
of
viruses
,
the
2B
protein
encoded
by
enteroviruses
is
well
understood
,
whereas
the
viroporin
activity
of
the
2B
protein
encoded
by
the
foot-and-mouth
disease
virus
(
FMDV
)
has
not
yet
been
described
.

An
analysis
of
the
FMDV
2B
protein
domains
by
computer-aided
programs
conducted
in
this
study
revealed
that
this
protein
may
contain
two
transmembrane
regions
.

Further
biochemical
,
biophysical
and
functional
studies
revealed
that
the
protein
possesses
a
number
of
features
typical
of
a
viroporin
when
it
is
overexpressed
in
bacterial
and
mammalian
cells
as
well
as
in
FMDV-infected
cells
.

The
protein
was
found
to
be
mainly
localized
in
the
endoplasmic
reticulum
(
ER
)
,
with
both
the
N-and
C-terminal
domains
stretched
into
the
cytosol
.

It
exhibited
cytotoxicity
in
Escherichia
coli
,
which
attenuated
2B
protein
expression
.

The
release
of
virions
from
cells
infected
with
FMDV
was
inhibited
by
amantadine
,
a
viroporin
inhibitor
.

The
2B
protein
monomers
interacted
with
each
other
to
form
both
intracellular
and
extracellular
oligomers
.

The
Ca
2+
concentration
in
the
cells
increased
,
and
the
integrity
of
the
cytoplasmic
membrane
was
disrupted
in
cells
that
expressed
the
2B
protein
.

Moreover
,
the
2B
protein
induced
intense
autophagy
in
host
cells
.

All
of
the
results
of
this
study
demonstrate
that
the
FMDV
2B
protein
has
properties
that
are
also
found
in
other
viroporins
and
may
be
involved
in
the
infection
mechanism
of
FMDV
.

Understanding
the
mechanisms
that
help
promote
protective
immune
responses
to
pathogens
is
a
major
challenge
in
biomedical
research
and
an
important
goal
for
the
design
of
innovative
therapeutic
or
vaccination
strategies
.

While
natural
killer
(
NK
)
cells
can
directly
contribute
to
the
control
of
viral
replication
,
whether
,
and
how
,
they
may
help
orchestrate
global
antiviral
defense
is
largely
unknown
.

To
address
this
question
,
we
took
advantage
of
the
welldefined
molecular
interactions
involved
in
the
recognition
of
mouse
cytomegalovirus
(
MCMV
)
by
NK
cells
.

By
using
congenic
or
mutant
mice
and
wild-type
versus
genetically
engineered
viruses
,
we
examined
the
consequences
on
antiviral
CD8
T
cell
responses
of
specific
defects
in
the
ability
of
the
NK
cells
to
control
MCMV
.

This
system
allowed
us
to
demonstrate
,
to
our
knowledge
for
the
first
time
,
that
NK
cells
accelerate
CD8
T
cell
responses
against
a
viral
infection
in
vivo
.

Moreover
,
we
identify
the
underlying
mechanism
as
the
ability
of
NK
cells
to
limit
IFN-a/b
production
to
levels
not
immunosuppressive
to
the
host
.

This
is
achieved
through
the
early
control
of
cytomegalovirus
,
which
dramatically
reduces
the
activation
of
plasmacytoid
dendritic
cells
(
pDCs
)
for
cytokine
production
,
preserves
the
conventional
dendritic
cell
(
cDC
)
compartment
,
and
accelerates
antiviral
CD8
T
cell
responses
.

Conversely
,
exogenous
IFN-a
administration
in
resistant
animals
ablates
cDCs
and
delays
CD8
T
cell
activation
in
the
face
of
NK
cell
control
of
viral
replication
.

Collectively
,
our
data
demonstrate
that
the
ability
of
NK
cells
to
respond
very
early
to
cytomegalovirus
infection
critically
contributes
to
balance
the
intensity
of
other
innate
immune
responses
,
which
dampens
early
immunopathology
and
promotes
optimal
initiation
of
antiviral
CD8
T
cell
responses
.

Thus
,
the
extent
to
which
NK
cell
responses
benefit
the
host
goes
beyond
their
direct
antiviral
effects
and
extends
to
the
prevention
of
innate
cytokine
shock
and
to
the
promotion
of
adaptive
immunity
.

Coronavirus
disease
2019
or
COVID-19
has
rapidly
emerged
as
a
global
pandemic
.

This
viral
infection
involves
the
upper
respiratory
tract
and
could
lead
to
severe
pneumonia
with
respiratory
distress
or
even
death
.

Certain
studies
have
found
higher
initial
plasma
levels
of
most
pro-inflammatory
cytokines
during
the
course
of
the
infection
.

In
this
context
,
both
in
vitro
and
in
vivo
studies
have
revealed
that
metronidazole
could
decrease
the
levels
of
several
cytokines
,
which
are
known
to
increase
during
the
COVID-19
infection
,
including
interleukin
(
IL
)
8
,
IL6
,
IL1B
,
tumor
necrosis
factor
(
TNF
)
α
,
IL12
,
IL1α
,
and
interferon
(
IFN
)
γ
,
as
well
as
the
levels
of
C-reactive
protein
(
CRP
)
and
neutrophil
count
.

Furthermore
,
the
drug
could
decrease
neutrophil-generated
reactive
oxygen
species
during
inflammation
.

Metronidazole
could
counteract
majority
of
the
immunopathological
manifestations
of
the
COVID-19
infection
.

Therefore
,
studies
with
a
large
sample
size
are
required
to
determine
the
efficacy
of
metronidazole
in
the
treatment
of
COVID-19
infection
.

This
study
aimed
at
substantiating
the
associations
of
the
apolipoproein
M
gene
(
APOM
)
with
type
2
diabetes
(
T2D
)
as
well
as
with
metabolic
traits
in
Hong
Kong
Chinese
.

In
addition
,
APOM
gene
function
was
further
characterized
to
elucidate
its
activity
in
cholesterol
metabolism
.

Seventeen
APOM
SNPs
documented
in
the
NCBI
database
were
genotyped
.

Five
SNPs
were
confirmed
in
our
study
cohort
of
1234
T2D
and
606
control
participants
.

Three
of
the
five
SNPs
rs707921
(
C+1871A
)
,
rs707922
(
G+1837T
)
and
rs805264
(
G+203A
)
were
in
linkage
disequilibrium
(
LD
)
.

We
chose
rs707922
to
tag
this
LD
region
for
down
stream
association
analyses
and
characterized
the
function
of
this
SNP
at
molecular
level
.

No
association
between
APOM
and
T2D
susceptibility
was
detected
in
our
Hong
Kong
Chinese
cohort
.

Interestingly
,
the
C
allele
of
rs805297
was
significantly
associated
with
T2D
duration
of
longer
than
10
years
(
OR
=
1.245
,
p
=
0.015
)
.

The
rs707922
TT
genotype
was
significantly
associated
with
elevated
plasma
total-and
LDL-cholesterol
levels
(
p
=
0.006
and
p
=
0.009
,
respectively
)
in
T2D
patients
.

Molecular
analyses
of
rs707922
lead
to
the
discoveries
of
a
novel
transcript
APOM5
as
well
as
the
cryptic
nature
of
exon
5
of
the
gene
.

Ectopic
expression
of
APOM5
transcript
confirmed
rs707922
allele-dependent
activity
of
the
transcript
in
modifying
cholesterol
homeostasis
in
vitro
.

In
conclusion
,
the
results
here
did
not
support
APOM
as
a
T2D
susceptibility
gene
in
Hong
Kong
Chinese
.

However
,
in
T2D
patients
,
a
subset
of
APOM
SNPs
was
associated
with
disease
duration
and
metabolic
traits
.

Further
molecular
analysis
proved
the
functional
activity
of
rs707922
in
APOM
expression
and
in

The
choice
of
an
appropriate
housekeeping
gene
for
normalisation
purposes
has
now
become
an
essential
requirement
when
designing
QPCR
experiments
.

This
is
of
particular
importance
when
using
QPCR
to
measure
viral
and
cellular
gene
transcription
levels
in
the
context
of
viral
infections
as
viruses
can
significantly
interfere
with
host
cell
pathways
,
the
components
of
which
traditional
housekeeping
genes
often
encode
.

In
this
study
we
have
determined
the
reliability
of
10
housekeeping
genes
in
context
of
four
heavily
studied
viral
infections
;
human
immunodeficiency
virus
type
1
,
herpes
simplex
virus
type
1
,
cytomegalovirus
and
varicella
zoster
virus
infections
using
a
variety
of
cell
types
and
virus
strains
.

This
provides
researchers
of
these
viruses
with
a
shortlist
of
potential
housekeeping
genes
to
use
as
normalisers
for
QPCR
experiments
.

Tuberculosis
(
TB
)
remains
a
serious
health
problem
worldwide
,
and
an
urgent
need
exists
to
improve
or
replace
the
available
vaccine
,
Mycobacterium
bovis
bacillus
Calmette-Guérin
(
BCG
)
.

Most
vaccination
protocols
adapt
two
or
three
doses
to
induce
long-term
lasting
immunity
.

Our
previous
study
showed
that
the
naked
DNA
encoding
the
triple-antigen
fusion
TFP846
(
Rv3615c-Mtb10.4-Rv2660c
)
induced
robust
T
cellular
immune
responses
accompanying
four
inoculations
against
mycobacteria
infection
.

However
,
a
number
of
compliance
issues
exist
in
some
areas
lacking
the
appropriate
medical
infrastructure
with
multiple
administrations
.

In
this
study
,
a
novel
vesicular
stomatitis
virus
expressing
TFP846
(
VSV-846
)
was
developed
and
the
immune
responses
elicited
by
VSV-846
were
evaluated
.

We
observed
that
intranasal
delivery
of
VSV-846
induced
a
potent
antigen-specific
T
cell
response
following
a
single
dose
and
VSV-846
efficiently
controlled
bacterial
growth
to
levels
∼10-fold
lower
than
that
observed
in
the
mock
group
6
weeks
post-infection
in
BCG-infected
mice
.

Importantly
,
mice
immunized
with
VSV-846
provided
long-term
protection
against
mycobacteria
infection
compared
with
those
receiving
p846
or
BCG
immunization
.

Increased
memory
T
cells
were
also
observed
in
the
spleens
of
VSV-846-vaccinated
mice
,
which
could
be
a
potential
mechanism
associated
with
long-term
protective
immune
response
.

These
findings
supported
the
use
of
VSV
as
an
antigen
delivery
vector
with
the
potential
for
TB
vaccine
development
.

Porcine
deltacoronavirus

is
a
newly

swine
enteropathogenic
coronavirus
affecting
pigs
of
all
ages
and
causing
diarrhea
problems
.

Research
findings
indicate
that
PDCoV
has
evolved
strategies
to
escape
innate
immune
response
in
host
cells
,
but
mechanism
of
PDCoV
in

modulation
is
not
well
understood
.

In
this

,
we
report
our
findings
on
identifying
the
alterations
of
host

with

of
the
innate

among
these

.

The

indicated
that
extensive
gene
functions

signaling
pathways
including
innate
immuneassociated
functions
and
pathways
were
affected
by

Particularly
,
4
of
5
innate
immune
signaling
pathways
,
which
were
primarily
affected
by
PDCoV
,
played
important
roles
in
I-IFN
's
antiviral
function
in
innate
immune

.

Additionally
,
16
of
the

were
predicted
as
potential
contributors
to
the
modulation
of
innate

affected
by
PDCoV
.

Our
research
findings
indicated
that
the
innate
immune-associated
genes
and
signaling
pathways
in
PK-15
cells
could
be
modified
by
the
infection
of
PDCoV
,
which
provides
a
fundamental
foundation
for
further

to
better

Real-time
PCR
techniques
are
now
commonly
used
for
the
detection
of
viral
genomes
in
various
human
specimens
and
require
for
validation
both
external
and
internal
controls
(
ECs
and
ICs
)
.

In
particular
,
ICs
added
to
clinical
samples
are
necessary
to
monitor
the
extraction
,
reverse
transcription
,
and
amplification
steps
in
order
to
detect
false-negative
results
resulting
from
PCR-inhibition
or
errors
in
the
technical
procedure
.

Here
,
we
performed
a
large
scale
evaluation
of
the
use
of
bacteriophages
as
ICs
in
routine
molecular
diagnosis
.

This
allowed
to
propose
simple
standardized
procedures
(
i
)
to
design
specific
ECs
for
both
DNA
and
RNA
viruses
and
(
ii
)
to
use
T4
(
DNA
)
or
MS2
(
RNA
)
phages
as
ICs
in
routine
diagnosis
.

Various
technical
formats
for
using
phages
as
ICs
were
optimised
and
validated
.

Subsequently
,
T4
and
MS2
ICs
were
evaluated
in
routine
real-time
PCR
or
RT-PCR
virological
diagnostic
tests
,
using
a
series
of
8,950
clinical
samples
(
representing
36
distinct
specimen
types
)
sent
to
our
laboratory
for
the
detection
of
a
variety
of
DNA
and
RNA
viruses
.

The
frequency
of
inefficient
detection
of
ICs
was
analyzed
according
to
the
nature
of
the
sample
.

Inhibitors
of
enzymatic
reactions
were
detected
at
high
frequency
in
specific
sample
types
such
as
heparinized
blood
and
bone
marrow
(
.70
%
)
,
broncho-alveolar
liquid
(
41
%
)
and
stools
(
36
%
)
.

The
use
of
T4
and
MS2
phages
as
ICs
proved
to
be
cost-effective
,
flexible
and
adaptable
to
various
technical
procedures
of
real-time
PCR
detection
in
virology
.

It
represents
a
valuable
strategy
for
enhancing
the
quality
of
routine
molecular
diagnosis
in
laboratories
that
use
in-house
designed
diagnostic
systems
,
which
can
conveniently
be
associated
to
the
use
of
specific
synthetic
ECs
.

The
high
rate
of
inhibitors
observed
in
a
variety
of
specimen
types
should
stimulate
the
elaboration
of
improved
technical
protocols
for
the
extraction
and
amplification
of
nucleic
acids

DNA
vaccines
present
one
of
the
most
cost-effective
platforms
to
develop
global
vaccines
,
which
have
been
tested
for
nearly
three
decades
in
preclinical
and
clinical
settings
with
some
success
in
the
clinic
.

However
,
one
of
the
major
challenges
for
the
development
of
DNA
vaccines
is
their
poor
immunogenicity
in
humans
,
which
has
led
to
refinements
in
DNA
delivery
,
dosage
in
prime/boost
regimens
and
the
inclusion
of
adjuvants
to
enhance
their
immunogenicity
.

In
this
review
,
we
focus
on
adjuvants
that
can
enhance
the
immunogenicity
of
DNA
encoded
antigens
and
highlight
the
development
of
a
novel
cytolytic
DNA
platform
encoding
a
truncated
mouse
perforin
.

The
application
of
this
innovative
DNA
technology
has
considerable
potential
in
the
development
of
effective
vaccines
.

The
spread
of
infectious
disease
epidemics
is
mediated
by
human
travel
.

Yet
human
mobility
patterns
vary
substantially
between
countries
and
regions
.

Quantifying
the
frequency
of
travel
and
length
of
journeys
in
well-defined
population
is
therefore
critical
for
predicting
the
likely
speed
and
pattern
of
spread
of
emerging
infectious
diseases
,
such
as
a
new
influenza
pandemic
.

Here
we
present
the
results
of
a
large
population
survey
undertaken
in
2007
in
two
areas
of
China
:
Shenzhen
city
in
Guangdong
province
,
and
Huangshan
city
in
Anhui
province
.

In
each
area
,
10,000
randomly
selected
individuals
were
interviewed
,
and
data
on
regular
and
occasional
journeys
collected
.

Travel
behaviour
was
examined
as
a
function
of
age
,
sex
,
economic
status
and
home
location
.

Women
and
children
were
generally
found
to
travel
shorter
distances
than
men
.

Travel
patterns
in
the
economically
developed
Shenzhen
region
are
shown
to
resemble
those
in
developed
and
economically
advanced
middle
income
countries
with
a
significant
fraction
of
the
population
commuting
over
distances
in
excess
of
50
km
.

Conversely
,
in
the
less
developed
rural
region
of
Anhui
,
travel
was
much
more
local
,
with
very
few
journeys
over
30
km
.

Travel
patterns
in
both
populations
were
well-fitted
by
a
gravity
model
with
a
lognormal
kernel
function
.

The
results
provide
the
first
quantitative
information
on
human
travel
patterns
in
modern
China
,
and
suggest
that
a
pandemic
emerging
in
a
less
developed
area
of
rural
China
might
spread
geographically
sufficiently
slowly
for
containment
to
be
feasible
,
while
spatial
spread
in
the
more
economically
developed
areas
might
be
expected
to
be
much
more
rapid
,
making
containment
more
difficult
.

Porcine
epidemic
diarrhea
virus
(
PEDV
)
,
a
predominant
cause

acute
enteric
infection
,
leads
to
severe
dehydrating
diarrhea
and
mortality
in
piglets
all
over
the
world
.

A
virulent
PEDV
YN13
strain
,
isolated
in
our
laboratory
,
was
attenuated
to
yield
an
attenuated
PEDV
strain
YN144
.

To
better
understand
the
pathogenesis
mechanism
and
the
virus-host
interaction
during
infection
with
both
PEDV
YN13
and
YN144
strains
,
a
comparative
proteomic
analysis
was
carried
out
to
investigate
the
proteomic
changes
produced
in
the
primary
target
organ
,
using
isobaric
tags
for
relative
and
absolute
quantitation
(
iTRAQ
)
labeling
,
followed
by
liquid
chromatography
tandem-mass
spectrometry
(
LC-MS/MS
)
.

A
total
of
269
and
301
differently
expressed
proteins
(
DEPs
)
were
identified
in
the
jejunum
tissues
of
the
piglets
inoculated
with
YN13
and
YN144
,
respectively
.

Bioinformatics
analysis
revealed
that
these
proteins
were
involved
in
stress
responses
,
signal
transduction
,
and
the
immune
system
.

All
of
these
involved
interferon-stimulated
genes
(
ISGs
)
which
were
up-regulated
in
jejunums
by
both
of
the
PEDV-infected
groups
.

Based
on
the
comparative
analysis
,
we
proposed
that
different
changes
induced
by
YN13
and
YN144
in
heterogeneous
nuclear
ribonucleoprotein
A1
(

,
and
some
members
in
the
heat
shock
protein
(
HSP
)
family
,
may
be
responsible
for
differences
in
their
pathogenicity
.

:
During
the
evaluation
period
,
485.221
ILI
cases
were
reported
among
6.386.621
outpatients
at
268
ILI
sentinel
sites
.

To
conserve
resources
,
cases
were
only
enrolled
and
tested
for
influenza
during
times
when
the
number
of
patients
meeting
the
ILI
case
definition
exceeded
7
%
(
10
%
after
2014
)
of
the
total
number
of
outpatients
for
the
week
.

When
this
benchmark
was
met
,
five
to
10
patients
were
enrolled
and
sampled
by
nasopharyngeal
swabs
the
following
week
.

In
total
,
The
National
Influenza
Center
(
NIC
)
received
2476
samples
,
of
which
683
(
27.6
%
)
were
positive
for
influenza
.

The
greatest
strength
of
the
system
was
its
representativeness
and
flexibility
.

The
timeliness
of
the
data
and
the
acceptability
of
the
surveillance
system
performed
moderately
well
;
however
,
the
utility
of
the
data
and
the
stability
and
simplicity
of
the
surveillance
system
need
improvement
.

Overall
,
the
performance
of
the
Tunisian
influenza
surveillance
system
was
evaluated
as
performing
moderately
well
for
situational
awareness
in
the
country
and
for
collecting
representative
influenza
virologic
samples
.

Conclusions
:
The
influenza
surveillance
system
in
Tunisia
provided
pertinent
evidence
for
public
health
interventions
related
to
influenza
situational
awareness
.

To
better
monitor
influenza
,
we
propose
that
ILI
surveillance
should
be
limited
to
sites
that
are
currently
performing
well
and
the
quality
of
data
collected
should
be
closely
monitored
and
improved
.

Background
:
Bovine
herpesvirus
type
1
(
BHV-1
)
is
an
important
pathogen
in
cattle
that
is
responsible
for
substantial
economic
losses
.

Previous
studies
suggest
that
BHV-1
may
induce
apoptosis
in
Madin-Darby
bovine
kidney
(
MDBK
)
cells
via
a
mechanism
only
involving
caspases
and
p53
.

However
,
the
mechanism
for
BHV-1-induced
MDBK
cell
apoptosis
still
requires
more
research
.

Methods
:
MDBK
was
used
as
a
model
to
study
the
precise
signaling
pathways
of
apoptosis
induced
by
BHV-1
infection
.

Results
:
BHV-1
infection
activated
a
Fas/FasL-mediated
apoptotic
pathway
,
resulting
in
activation
of
caspase-8
and
cleavage
of
Bid
.

In
addition
,
BHV-1
infection
down-regulated
Bcl-2
and
up-regulated
Bax
expression
,
thereby
initiating
the
release
of
cytochrome
c
followed
by
caspase-9
activation
.

The
combined
activation
of
the
extrinsic
and
intrinsic
pathways
resulted
in
activation
of
downstream
effecter
caspase-3
and
poly
ADP-ribose
polymerase
(
PARP
)
,
leading
to
apoptosis
.

Furthermore
,
blocking
apoptosis
using
caspase
inhibitors
improved
BHV-1-infected
MDBK
cell
viability
to
different
extent
.

BHV-1
infection
did
not
induce
significant
DNA
fragmentation
in
MDBK
cells
pretreated
with
ammonium
chloride
(
NH
4
Cl
)
or
cells
infected
with
UV-inactivated
BHV-1
.

Blocking
caspases
activation
increased
BHV-1
replication
.

Conclusions
:
BHV-1
induces
apoptosis
in
MDBK
cells
through
extrinsic
and
intrinsic
pathways
and
there
might
be
cross-talk
between
the
two
pathways
.

In
addition
,
BHV-1
replication
may
be
necessary
for
the
induction
of
apoptosis
in
BHV-1-infected
cells
,
and
prolonged
cell
viability
benefits
BHV-1
replication

Corona
viruses
cause
common
cold
,
and
infections
caused
by
corona
viruses
are
generally
self-resolving
.

During
the
last
4
years
,
corona
viruses
have
become
the
most
important
viruses
worldwide
because
of
the
occurrence
of
several
recent
deaths
caused
by
corona
viruses
in
Saudi
Arabia
.

Spread
of
the
infection
occurred
worldwide
;
however
,
most
cases
of
mortality
have
occurred
in
the
Middle
East
.

Owing
to
the
predominance
of
outbreaks
in
the
Middle
Eastern
countries
,
the
virus
was
renamed
a
Middle
East
respiratory
syndrome
corona
virus
(
MERS-CoV
)
by
the
Corona
virus
Study
Group
.

The
Center
for
Diseases
Control
and
Prevention
and
World
Health
Organization
maintain
a
website
that
is
updated
frequently
with
new
cases
of
MERS-CoV
infection
.

In
this
review
,
we
describe
the
history
and
epidemiology
of
this
novel
virus
.

Studies
of
the
genetics
and
molecular
mechanisms
of
this
virus
are
expected
to
facilitate
the
development
of
vaccines
in
the
future
.

However
,
there
were
no
prospectively
individualized
assessments
of
physiological
,
functional
and
quality-of-life
measures
after
hospital
discharge
.

The
current
study
aims
to
assess
the
main
determinants
of
functional
disability
of
these
patients
during
the
follow-up
.

Fifty-six
influenza
A
(
H7N9
)
survivors
were
investigated
during
the
2-year
after
discharge
from
the
hospital
.

Results
show
interstitial
change
and
fibrosis
on
pulmonary
imaging
remained
6
months
after
hospital
discharge
.

Both
ventilation
and
diffusion
dysfunction
improved
,
but
restrictive
and
obstructive
patterns
on
ventilation
function
test
persisted
throughout
the
follow-up
period
.

For
patients
with
acute
respiratory
distress
syndrome
lung
functions
improved
faster
during
the
first
six
months
.

Role-physical
and
Role-emotional
domains
in
the
36-Item
Short-Form
Health
Survey
were
worse
than
those
of
a
sex-and
age-matched
general
population
group
.

The
quality
of
life
of
survivors
with
ARDS
was
lower
than
those
with
no
ARDS
.

Our
findings
suggest
that
pulmonary
function
and
imaging
findings
improved
during
the
first
6
months
especially
for
those
with
ARDS
,
however
longterm
lung
disability
and
psychological
impairment
in
H7N9
survivors
persisted
at
2
years
after
discharge
from
the
hospital
.

During
the
spring
of
2013
,
a
novel
avian-origin
influenza
virus
emerged
.

This
new
virus
had
a
genome
similar
phylogenetically
to
that
of
a
chicken
A
(
H7N9
)
virus
isolated
from
an
epidemiologically
linked
live
poultry
market
1
and
was
thus
identified
as
an
avian
(
H7N9
)
virus
1-3
.

H7N9
viruses
can
cause
severe
illnesses
in
persons
with
contact
to
poultry
,
including
pneumonia
and
acute
respiratory
distress
syndrome
(
ARDS
)
with
high
case
fatality
rates
2,4
.

As
of
August
31
,
2016
,
a
total
of
795
laboratory-confirmed
cases
of
human
infection
with
avian
influenza
A
(
H7N9
)
virus
had
been
reported
in
China
4
.

The
infections
were
also
detected
in
the
travelers
of
Canada
(
two
)
and
Malaysia
(
one
)
to
China
4
.

Although
the
clinical
features
of
hospitalized
patients
with
H7N9
virus
infection
are
generally
similar
to
those
of
patients
with
severe
pandemic
H1N1
5
or
H5N1
virus
infections
6
,
the
mortality
rates
of
H7N9
and
H5N1
have
been
reported
to
be
37.1
%
and
53.2
%
,
respectively
7
,
whereas
that
of
H1N1
was
<
1
%
5
.

Patients
who
survive
influenza
A
(
H7N9
)
virus
infection
are
at
risk
of
physical
and
psychological
complications
of
lung
injury
and
multi-organ
dysfunction
.

However
,
previous
studies
have
not
included
prospectively
individualized
assessments
of
physiological
,
functional
and
quality-of-life
measures
after
hospital
discharge
to
assess
the
main
determinants
of
functional
disability
.

Therefore
,
the
goal
of
this
study
was
to
assess
the
long-term
changes
in
pulmonary
function
and
quality
of
life
among
patients
recovering
from
H7N9
infection
.

Of
the
83
patients
with
H7N9
infection
between
March
2013
and
May
2014
,

During
a
comparison
of
the
infectivity
of
mNDK
,
a
CD4-independent
human
immunodeficiency
virus
type
1
(
HIV-1
)
strain
,
to
various
cell
lines
,
we
found
that
HeLa
cells
were
much
less
susceptible
than
293T
and
TE671
cells
.

Hybridoma
cells
between
HeLa
and
293T
cells
were
as
susceptible
as
293T
cells
,
suggesting
that
cellular
factors
enhance
the
mNDK
infection
in
293T
cells
.

By
screening
a
cDNA
expression
library
in
HeLa
cells
,
cystatin
C
was
isolated
as
an
enhancer
of
the
mNDK
infection
.

Because
cathepsin
B
protease
,
a
natural
ligand
of
cystatin
C
,
was
upregulated
in
HeLa
cells
,
we
speculated
that
the
high
levels
of
cathepsin
B
activities
were
inhibitory
to
the
CD4-independent
infection
and
that
cystatin
C
enhanced
the
infection
by
impairing
the
excessive
cathepsin
B
activity
.

Consistent
with
this
idea
,
pretreatment
of
HeLa
cells
with
125
mM
of
CA-074Me
,
a
cathepsin
B
inhibitor
,
resulted
in
an
8-fold
enhancement
of
the
mNDK
infectivity
.

Because
cathepsin
B
is
activated
by
low
pH
in
acidic
endosomes
,
we
further
examined
the
potential
roles
of
endosomes
in
the
CD4-independent
infection
.

Suppression
of
endosome
acidification
or
endocytosis
by
inhibitors
or
by
an
Eps15
dominant
negative
mutant
reduced
the
infectivity
of
mNDK
in
which
CD4-dependent
infections
were
not
significantly
impaired
.

Taken
together
,
these
results
suggest
that
endocytosis
,
endosomal
acidification
,
and
cathepsin
B
activity
are
involved
in
the
CD4-independent
entry
of
HIV-1
.

Background
:
Neonatal
diarrhoea
represents
a
major
disease
problem
in
the
early
stages
of
animal
production
,
increasing
significantly
pre-weaning
mortality
and
piglets
weaned
below
the
target
weight
.

Enteric
diseases
in
newborn
piglets
are
often
of
endemic
presentation
,
but
may
also
occur
as
outbreaks
with
high
morbidity
and
mortality
.

The
objective
of
this
study
was
to
assess
the
frequency
of
different
pathogens
involved
in
cases
of
recurrent
neonatal

in
Spain
.

Results
:
A

of
327
litters
from
109
sow
farms
located
in
Spain
with
neonatal

were
sampled
to
establish
a

Conclusion
:
In
conclusion
,
C.

Background
:
Human
adenoviruses
(
HAdV
)
play
a
significant
role
in
pediatric
respiratory
tract
infections
.

To
date
,
over
60
types
of
HAdV
have
been
identified
.

Here
,
HAdV
types
are
characterized
in
children
in
the
Beijing
area
with
acute

(
ALRTIs
)
and
the
clinical

.

Methods
:
Respiratory

were
further
typed
by
PCR
and
sequencing
.

Results
:
Among
3356
patients
with
ALRTIs
,
194
(
5.8
%
)
were
found
to
have
HAdV
infection
.

HAdV
infection
was
primarily
confined
to
children
(
88.35
%
)
less
than
5
years
of
age
.

A
total
of
11
different
types
of
HAdV
were
detected
throughout
the
study
period
,
with
HAdV-B7
(
49.0
%
)
and
HAdV-B3
(
26.3
%
)
as
the
most
prevalent
types
,
followed
by
HAdV-C2
(
7.7
%
)
and
HAdVC1
(
4.6
%
)
.

Newly
emerging
and
re-emergent
types

HAdV-B55
(
n

,
HAdV-C57
(

,
and
HAdV-B14p1
(

,
were
identified
.

Results
also
included
the
reported
first
case
of
co-infection
with
HAdV-C2
and
HAdV-C57
.

Clinical
entities
of
patients
with
single
HAdV
infection
(
n
=
49
)
were
similar
to
those
with
mixed
HAdV/respiratory
syncytial
virus
(
RSV
)
infections
(
n
=
41
)
.

Patients
with
HAdV-B7
infection
had
longer
duration
of
fever
and
higher
serum
levels
of
muscle
enzymes
than
HAdV-B3-infected
patients
.

Conclusions
:
During
the
study
period
,
HAdV-B7
and
HAdV-B3
were
the
predominant
types
identified
in
pediatric
ALRTIs
.

HAdV-B7
infection
tends
to
have
more
severe
clinical
consequences
.

The
presence
of
newly
emerging
types
or
variants
and
co-infection
with
different
types
of
HAdV
highlights
the
need
for
constant
and
close
surveillance
of
HAdV
infection
.

We
define
data
analyses
to
monitor
a
change
in
R
,
the
average
number
of
secondary
cases
caused
by
a
typical
infected
individual
.

The
input
dataset
consists
of
incident
cases
partitioned
into
outbreaks
,
each
initiated
from
a
single
index
case
.

We
split
the
input
dataset
into
two
successive
subsets
,
to
evaluate
two
successive
R
values
,
according
to
the
Bayesian
paradigm
.

We
used
the
Bayes
factor
between
the
model
with
two
different
R
values
and
that
with
a
single
R
value
to
justify
that
the
change
in
R
is
statistically
significant
.

We
validated
our
approach
using
simulated
data
,
generated
using
known
R.
In
particular
,
we
found
that
claiming
two
distinct
R
values
may
depend
significantly
on
the
number
of
outbreaks
.

We
then
reanalyzed
data
previously
studied
by
Jansen

Our
analyses
showed
that
the
1995-2002

should
be
divided
into
two
separate
subsets
for
the

,
Jansen

this

,
our
methodology
for
detecting

worked
satisfactorily

Acute
respiratory
distress
syndrome
(
ARDS
)
caused
by
severe
sepsis
remains
a
major
challenge
in
intensive
care
medicine
.

ACE2
has
been
shown
to
protect
against
lung
injury
.

However
,
the
mechanisms
of
its
protective
effects
on
ARDS
are
largely
unknown
.

Here
,
we
report
that
ACE2
prevents
LPS-induced
ARDS
by
inhibiting
MAPKs
and
NF-κB
signaling
pathway
.

Lentiviral
packaged
Ace2
cDNA
or
Ace2
shRNA
was
intratracheally
administrated
into
the
lungs
of
male
SD
rats
.

Two
weeks
after
gene
transfer
,
animals
received
LPS
(
7.5
mg/Kg
)
injection
alone
or
in
combination
with
Mas
receptor
antagonist
A779
(
10
μg/Kg
)
or
ACE2
inhibitor
MLN-4760
(
1
mg/Kg
)
pretreatment
.

LPS-induced
lung
injury
and
inflammatory
response
were
significantly
prevented
by
ACE2
overexpression
and
deteriorated
by
Ace2
shRNA
.

A779
or
MLN-4760
pretreatment
abolished
the
protective
effects
of
ACE2
.

Moreover
,
overexpression
of
ACE2
significantly
reduced
the
Ang
II/Ang-
(
1-7
)
ratio
in
BALF
and
up-regulated
Mas
mRNA
expression
in
lung
,
which
was
reversed
by
A779
.

Importantly
,
the
blockade
of
ACE2
on
LPSinduced
phosphorylation
of
ERK1/2
,
p38
and
p50/p65
was
also
abolished
by
A779
.

Whereas
,
only
the
ERK1/2
inhibitor
significantly
attenuated
lung
injury
in
ACE2
overexpressing
rats
pretreated
with
A779
.

Our
observation
suggests
that
AEC2
attenuates
LPS-induced
ARDS
via
the
Ang-
(
1-7
)
/Mas
pathway
by
inhibiting
ERK/NF-κB
activation
.

Acute
respiratory
distress
syndrome
(
ARDS
)
remains
the
major
cause
of
mortality
and
morbidity
in
intensive
care
1,2
.

ARDS
is
a
type
of
acute
diffuse
and
inflammatory
lung
injury
,
which
is
caused
by
the
release
of
pro-inflammatory
cytokines
and
the
recruitment
of
granulocytes
and
monocytes
into
the
lung
,
leading
to
increased
pulmonary
vascular
permeability
and
loss
of
aerated
alveolus
3,4
.

At
present
,
the
only
effective
therapy
for
ARDS
is
protective
mechanical
ventilation
with
low
tidal
volume
of
6
mL/kg
5
.

No
specific
and
effective
pharmacological
intervention
for
ARDS
is
currently
available
6
.

Therefore
,
it
is
urgent
to
identify
,
validate
,
and
develop
pharmaceutical
drugs
for
the
treatment
of
ARDS
.

Angiotensin-converting
enzyme
2
(
ACE2
)
,
a
homologue
of
ACE
,
shares
approximately
61
%
homology
sequence
with
the
catalytic
domains
of
ACE
but
acts
as
an
endogenous
counter-regulator
of
ACE
7
.

In
contrast
to
ACE
,
which
cleaves
angiotensin
(
Ang
)
I
into
Ang
II
,
ACE2
primarily
hydrolyzes
Ang
II
into
Ang-
(
1-7
)
.

Ang
II
triggers
vasoconstriction
,
inflammation
,
proliferation
and
apoptosis
via
binding
to
its
specific
Ang
II
type
1
receptor
(
AT1R
)
,
while
Ang-
(
1-7
)
counteracts
the
effects
of
Ang
II
via
its
G
protein-coupled
receptor
Mas
8-10
.

Therefore
,
the
balance
of
ACE
and
ACE2
influences
the
endogenous
ratio
of
Ang
II
to
Ang-
(
1-7
)
,
and
consequently
contributes
to
the
regulation
of
the
tension
of
vascular
,
as
well
as
inflammatory
response
and
organ
function
after
injury
11,12
.

Accumulating
evidence
indicate
that
ACE2
plays
an
important
role
in
the
pathophysiology
of
ARDS
.

ACE2
has
been
identified
as
a
key
receptor
of
coronavirus
that
causes
the
severe
acute
respiratory
syndrome
,
and
its
level
in
human
airway
epithelia
positively
correlates
with
coronavirus
infection
13
.

Compared
with
wild
type
mice
,
Ace2
knockout
mice
exhibited
impaired
exercise
capacity
,
worse
lung
function
and
exacerbated
lung
fibrosis
in
model
of
bleomycin-induced
lung
injury
14
.

Furthermore
,
in
three
animal
models
of
ARDS
,
Ace2
knockout
mice
showed
severe
lung
disease
,
including
enhanced
vascular
permeability
and
increased
lung
edema
as
compared
to
wild
type
mice
15
.

Treatment
with
recombinant
ACE2
effectively
improved
symptoms
and
attenuated
arterial
hypoxemia
in
a
piglet
model
of
lipopolysaccharide
(
LPS
)
-induced
ARDS
16
.

Thus
,
ACE2
plays
a
protective
role
in
ARDS
and
is
potential
for
the
development
as
a
drug
for
ARDS
therapy
;
however
,
the
underlying
molecular
mechanism
by
which
ACE2
prevents
ARDS
remains
elusive
.

Previous
studies
have
showed
that
the
activation
of
mitogen-activated
protein
kinases
(
MAPKs
)
pathway
is
associated
with
the
process
of
ARDS
.

The
phosphorylation
levels
of
p38
MAPK
,
extracellular
signal-regulated
kinase
(
ERK
)
and
Jun
N-terminal
kinase
(
JNK
)
are
all
significantly
increased
in
LPS-induced
lung
injury
17
.

Consequently
,
inhibition
of
p38
MAPK
or
ERK
efficiently
attenuates
LPS-induced
pulmonary
inflammatory
response
18
,
19
.

The
activity
of
p38
MAPK
in
the
lung
has
been
associated
with
peritoneal
sepsis-induced
pulmonary
edema
and
leukocyte
infiltration
20
.

Interestingly
,
Ferreira
et
al
.

recently
found
that
activated
cardiac
ACE2
prevents
hypertension-induced
cardiac
fibrosis
by
inhibiting
ERK
phosphorylation
21
.

Moreover
,
AT1R
blocker
,
telmisartan
,
exerts
protective
effects
on
heart
failure
through
upregulating
myocardial
ACE2
level
and
inhibiting
p38
MAPK
,
ERK
and
JNK
phosphorylation
22
.

The
activation
of
MAPKs
pathway
is
also
involved
in
the
regulation
of
Ace2
mRNA
expression
in
rat
vascular
smooth
muscle
cells
23
.

In
addition
,
LPS
stimulation
activates
the
NF-κ
B
signaling
pathway
via
binding
to
toll-like
receptor
4
(
TLR4
)
,
which
is
closely
related
to
LPS-induced
lung
injury
and
inflammation
24
.

Our
previous
in
vitro
study
demonstrated
that
ACE2
prevented
rat
pulmonary
microvascular
endothelial
cells
(
PMVECs
)
from
LPS-induced
apoptosis
and
inflammation
through
inhibiting
the
activation
of
JNK
and
NF-κ
B
pathways
25
.

Therefore
,
we
hypothesize
that
ACE2
may
protect
against
LPS-induced
acute
lung
injury
by
inhibiting
the
MAPKs/
NF-κ
B
pathway
.

A
variety
of
animal
species
have
been
used
to
study
LPS-induced
lung
injury
;
however
,
there
are
intra-species
differences
in
the
biological
response
to
LPS
challenge
,
leading
to
inconsistency
in
published
results
.

While
rat
and
mouse
models
are
the
most
widely
used
models
for
ARDS
research
,
recent
research
has
shown
disparities
of
the
LPS
structures
that
are
recognized
by
TLR4
between
humans
and
mice
,
which
may
contribute
to
variability
in
the
response
to
LPS-induced
ARDS
.

Additionally
,
the
relatively
small
mass
of
mice
may
prohibit
the
measurement
of
physiological
parameters
and
also
make
it
more
difficult
to
obtain
sufficient
quantities
of
samples
,
such
as
blood
,
plasma
and
BALF
26,27
.

In
the
present
study
,
we
applied
a
lentiviral-mediated
gene
delivery
approach
to
overexpress
or
knock
down
ACE2
in
rat
lung
tissue
,
and
investigated
whether
pulmonary
overexpression
of
ACE2
exerts
beneficial
effects
against
LPS-induced
lung
injury
via
suppressing
the
MAPKs/
NF-κ
B
pathways
.

Pemphigus
vulgaris
(
PV
)
is
an
autoimmune
bullous
disease
of
the
skin
and
mucous
membranes
characterized
by
the
presence
of
circulating

tissue-bound
autoantibodies
against
keratinocyte
cell
surface
antigens
,
specifically
desmoglein
(
Dsg
)
1
and
3
.

The
pathogenic
role
of
anti-Dsg
antibodies
is
well-established
,
while
the
mechanism
of
blister
formation
is
only
partly
defined
.

We
have
applied
a
previously
developed
method
for
the
efficient
immortalization
of
IgG+
memory
B
cells
to
identify
novel
target
antigens
in
PV
.

A
human
monoclonal
antibody
reactive
with
a
hitherto
unreported
non-Dsg
antigen
was
isolated
.

Immunoprecipitation
and
immunoblotting
studies
with
keratinocyte
extracts
indicated
α-catenin
as
the
putative
antigen
,
then
confirmed
by
immunoblotting
on
the
recombinant
protein
.

Four
of
ten
PV
sera
reacted
with
recombinant
α-catenin
.

Although
the
isolated
human
monoclonal
antibody
was
per
se
unable
to
dissociate
keratinocyte
monolayers
and
also
to
synergize
with
a
pathogenic
antibody
in
vitro
,
further
studies
are
warranted
to
assess
its
possible
in
vivo
contribution
in
the
multifactorial
pathogenesis
and
heterogeneous
manifestations
of
PV

.

Background
:
The
prevalence
of
pneumocystis
pneumonia
(
PCP
)
and
associated
hypoxic
respiratory
failure
is
increasing
in
human
immunodeficiency
virus
(
HIV
)
-negative
patients
.

However
,
no
prior
studies
have
evaluated
the
effect
of
early
anti-PCP
treatment
on
clinical
outcomes
in
HIV-negative
patient
with
severe
PCP
.

Therefore
,
this
study
investigated
the
association
between
the
time
to
anti-PCP
treatment
and
the
clinical
outcomes
in
HIV-negative
patients
with
PCP
who
presented
with
hypoxemic
respiratory
failure
.

Methods
:
A
retrospective
observational
study
was
performed
involving
51
HIV-negative
patients
with
PCP
who
presented
in
respiratory
failure
and
were
admitted
to
the
intensive
care
unit
between
October
2005
and
July
2018
.

A
logistic
regression
model
was
used
to
adjust
for
potential
confounding
factors
in
the
association
between
the
time
to
anti-PCP
treatment
and
in-hospital

Results
:
All
patients
were
treated
with
appropriate
anti-PCP
treatment
,
primarily
involving
trimethoprim/
sulfamethoxazole
.

The
median
time
to
anti-PCP
treatment
was
58.0
(
28.0-97.8
)
hours
.

Thirty-one
(
60.8
%
)
patients
were
treated
empirically
prior
to
confirmation
of
the
microbiological
diagnosis
.

However
,
the
hospital
mortality
rates
were
not
associated
with
increasing
quartiles
of
time
until
anti-PCP
treatment
(
P
=
0.818
,
test
for
trend
)
.

In
addition
,
hospital
mortality
of
patients
received
early
empiric
treatment
was
not
better
than
those
of
patients
received
definitive
treatment
after
microbiologic
diagnosis
(
48.4
%
vs.
40.0
%
,
P
=
0.765
)
.

In
a
multiple
logistic
regression
model
,
the
time
to
anti-PCP
treatment
was
not
associated
with
increased
mortality
.

However
,
age
(
adjusted
OR
1.07
,
95

)
and
failure
to
initial
treatment
(
adjusted
OR
13.03
,
95
%
CI
2.34-72.65
)
were
independently
associated
with
increased
mortality
.

Conclusions
:
There
was
no
association
between
the
time
to
anti-PCP
treatment
and
treatment
outcomes
in
HIVnegative
patients
with

Human
coronaviruses
(
CoVs
)
are
increasingly
recognized
as
important
respiratory
pathogens
associated
with
a
broad
range
of
clinical
diseases
.

We
sought
to
increase
the
insight
into
clinically
relevant
CoV
infections
by
monitoring
antigen
concentrations
in
six
confirmed
CoV-positive
patients
using
a
newly
developed
assay
for
rapid
detection
of
CoV
OC43
infections
.

Antigen
positivity
lasted
3
to
6
days
in
secondary
infections
and
13
days
in
primary
infection
.

CoV
infections
are
clinically
diverse
,
are
common
,
and
can
not
be
diagnosed
from
clinical
symptoms
alone
.

Background
:
Propionibacterium
acnes
has
been
rarely
isolated
as
a
commensal
from
dogs
,
but
there
is
little
evidence
of
pathogenicity
.

Urinary
tract
infections
are
common
in
dogs
and
are
typically
caused
by
various
commensal
bacteria
.

Here
we
present
the
first
case
report
of
a
urinary
tract
infection
caused
by
P.
acnes
.

Case
presentation
:
A
6-year-old
female
Japanese
Shiba
Inu
was
hospitalized
for
polyuria
,
polydipsia
,
and
severe
hematuria
.

At
admission
,
blood
tests
revealed
leukocytosis
,
slight
anemia
,
decreased
albumin
,
and
slightly
elevated
blood
urea
nitrogen
.

Computerized
tomography
showed
gas
accumulation
on
the
inner
side
of
the
bladder
wall
.

Urinalysis
revealed
proteinuria
and
bilirubinuria
without
glycosuria
.

The
urine
sediment
contained
large
numbers
of
erythrocytes
and
leukocytes
.

Additionally
,
rod-shaped
bacteria
were
detected
by
Diff-Quik
staining
.

Enrofloxacin
and
metronidazole
were
administered
empirically
;
however
,
the
renal
function
declined
sharply
and
the
patient
died
2
days
later
.

Bacteriological
examination
revealed
that
the
causative
agent
was
Propionibacterium
acnes
,
which
was
identified
as
sequence
type
53
via
multilocus
sequence
typing
.

This
isolate
showed
high
susceptibility
to
ampicillin
,
amoxicillin/clavulanic
acid
,
cefoxitin
,
imipenem
,
clindamycin
,
tetracycline
,
chloramphenicol
,
and
enrofloxacin
,
but
was
resistant
to
metronidazole
.

Conclusion
:
To
the
best
of
our
knowledge
,
this
is
the
first
case
report
of
a
dog
with
urinary
tract
infection
caused
by
P.
acnes

Infection
with
protozoan
parasite
Trypanosoma
cruzi
results
in
activation
of
nucleotidebinding
domain
and
leucine-rich
repeat
containing
receptors
(
NLRs
)
.

NLR
activation
leads
to
inflammasome
formation
,
the
activation
of
caspase-1
,
and
the
subsequent
cleavage
of
IL-1β
and
IL-18
.

Considering
that
inflammasome
activation
and
IL-1β
induction
by
macrophages
are
key
players
for
an
appropriate
T
cell
response
,
we
investigated
the
relevance
of
NLR
pyrin
domain-containing
3
(
NLRP3
)
and
caspase-1/11
to
elucidate
their
roles
in
the
induction
of
different
T
cell
phenotypes
and
the
relationship
with
parasite
load
and
hepatic
inflammation
during
T.
cruzi-Tulahuen
strain
acute
infection
.

We
demonstrated
that
infected
nlrp3−/−
and
C57BL/6
wild
type
(
WT
)
mice
exhibited
similar
parasitemia
and
survival
,
although
the
parasite
load
was
higher
in
the
livers
of
nlrp3−/−
mice
than
in
those
of
WT
mice
.

Increased
levels
of
transaminases
and
pro-inflammatory
cytokines
were
found
in
the
plasma
of
WT
and
nlrp3−/−
mice
indicating
that
NLRP3
is
dispensable
to
control
the
parasitemia
but
it
is
required
for
a
better
clearance
of
parasites
in
the
liver
.

Importantly
,
we
have
found
that
NLRP3
and
caspase-1/11-deficient
mice
differentially
modulate
T
helper
(
Th1
,
Th2
,
and
Th17
)
and
cytotoxic
T
lymphocyte
phenotypes
.

Strikingly
,
caspase-1/11−/−
mice
showed
the
most
dramatic
reduction
in
the
number
of
IFN-γ-and
IL-17-producing
CD4+
and
CD8+
T
cells
associated
with
higher
parasitemia
and
lower
survival
.

Additionally
,
caspase-1/11−/−
mice
demonstrated
significantly
reduced
liver
inflammation
with
the
lowest
alanine
aminotransferase
(
ALT
)
levels
but
the
highest
hepatic
parasitic
load
.

These
results
unequivocally
demonstrate
that
caspase-1/11
pathway
plays
an
important
role
in
the
induction
of
liver
adaptive
immunity
against
this
parasite
infection
as
well
as
in
hepatic
inflammation

,
C.

has
caused
healthcare
outbreaks
around
the
world
,
often
involving
high

Identification
of
C.

been
a
major

Early
detection

implementation
of

practices
can
prevent
its

The
aim
of
this

However
,

to
improve

have
made
substantial
progress

The

Background
:
The
functional

of
ELR-positive
CXC
chemokines
during
viral
-induced
demyelination
was
assessed
.

Inoculation
of
the
neuroattenuated
JHM
strain
of
mouse
hepatitis
virus
(
JHMV
)
into
the
CNS

susceptible
mice

in
an
acute
encephalomyelitis
that
evolves
into
a

disease
,
modeling
white
matter
pathology
observed
in
the
human
demyelinating
disease
Multiple
Sclerosis
.

Methodology/Principal
Findings
:
JHMV
infection
induced
the
rapid
and
sustained
expression
of
transcripts
specific
for
the
ELR
(
+
)
chemokine
ligands
CXCL1
and
CXCL2
,
as
well
as
their
binding
receptor
CXCR2
,
which
was
enriched
within
the
spinal
cord
during
chronic
infection
.

Inhibiting
CXCR2
signaling
with
neutralizing
antiserum
significantly
(
p,0.03
)
delayed
clinical
recovery
.

Moreover
,
CXCR2
neutralization
was
associated
with
an
increase
in
the
severity
of
demyelination
that
was
independent
of
viral
recrudescence
or
modulation
of
neuroinflammation
.

Rather
,
blocking
CXCR2
was
associated
with
increased
numbers
of
apoptotic
cells
primarily
within
white
matter
tracts
,
suggesting
that
oligodendrocytes
were
affected
.

JHMV
infection
of
enriched
oligodendrocyte
progenitor
cell
(
OPC
)
cultures
revealed
that
apoptosis
was
associated
with
elevated
expression
of
cleaved
caspase
3
and
muted
Bcl-2
expression
.

Inclusion
of
CXCL1
within
JHMV
infected
cultures
restricted
caspase
3
cleavage
and
increased
Bcl-2
expression
that
was
associated
with
a
significant
(
p,0.001
)
decrease
in
apoptosis
.

CXCR2
deficient
oligodendrocytes
were
refractory
to
CXCL1
mediated
protection
from
JHMV
-induced
apoptosis
,
readily
activating
caspase
3
and
down
regulating
Bcl-2
.

Conclusion/Significance
:
These
findings
highlight
a
previously
unappreciated
role
for
CXCR2
signaling
in
protecting
oligodendrocyte
lineage
cells
from
apoptosis

,
mediating
filovirus
entry
into

through
interactions
with

on

.

TIM-1
expression
has
been
implicated
in
Ebola
virus
(
EBOV
)
pathogenesis
;
however
,
it
remains
unclear
whether
this
is
due
to
TIM-1
serving
as
a
filovirus
receptor
in
vivo
or
,
as
others
have
suggested
,
TIM-1
induces
a
cytokine
storm
elicited
by
T
cell/virion
interactions
.

Here
,
we
use
a
BSL2
model
virus
that
expresses
EBOV
glycoprotein
to
demonstrate
the
importance
of
TIM-1
as
a
virus
receptor
late
during
in
vivo
infection
.

Our
studies
provide
evidence
that
at
late
times
during
EBOV
GP/rVSV
infection
,
TIM-1
increased
virus
load
and
associated
mortality
,
consistent
with
an
important
role
of
this
receptor
in
virus
entry
.

This
work
suggests
that
inhibitors
which
block
TIM-1/virus
interaction
may
serve
as
effective
antivirals
,
reducing
virus
load
at
late
times
during
EBOV
infection
.

T
cell
immunoglobulin
mucin
domain-1
(
TIM-1
)
is
one
of
a
number
of
phosphatidylserine
(
PS
)
receptors
that
mediate
clearance
of
apoptotic
bodies
by
binding
PS
on
the
surface
of
dead
or
dying
cells
.

Enveloped
viruses
mimic
apoptotic
bodies
by
exposing
PS
on
the
outer
leaflet
of
the
viral
membrane
.

While
TIM-1
has
been
shown
to
serve
as
an
adherence
factor/receptor
for
filoviruses
in
tissue
culture
,
limited
studies
have
investigated
the
role
of
TIM-1
as
a
receptor
in
vivo
.

Here
,
we
sought
to
determine
if
TIM-1
was
critical
for
Ebola
virus
glycoprotein-mediated
infection
using
a
BSL2
model
virus
.

We
demonstrate
that
loss
of
TIM-1
expression
results
in
decreased
virus
load
late
during
infection
and
significantly
reduced
virus-elicited
mortality
.

These
findings
provide
evidence
that
TIM-1
serves
as
an
important
receptor
for
Ebola
virus
in
vivo
.

Blocking
TIM-1/EBOV
interactions
may
be
effective
antiviral
strategy
to
reduce
viral
load
and
pathogenicity
at
late
times
of
EBOV

subsequently
,
if
no
viral
clearance
is
achieved
,
up
to
two
courses
of
RBV
.

If
both
RBV
regimens
fail
,
pegIFN-α
can
be
administrated
,
but
is
only
suited
for
the
subset
of
liver-transplant
recipients
[
12
]
[
13
]
[
14
]
[
15
]
.

Thus
,
RBV
is
the
treatment
of
choice
but
leads
to
viral
clearance
in
only
80
%
of
patients
treated
[
16
]
.

Similar
to
pegIFN-α
,
it
is
contraindicated
in
the
major
risk
group
of
pregnant
women
,
emphasizing
the
importance
of
new
therapy
options
.

In
this
review
,
we
focus
on
the
urgent
need
and
current
efforts
in
HEV
drug
development
.

Transspecies
transmission
of
retroviruses
is
a
frequent
event
,
and
the
human
immunodeficiency
virus-1
(
HIV-1
)
is
a
well-known
example
.

The
gibbon
ape
leukaemia
virus
(
GaLV
)
and
koala
retrovirus
(
KoRV
)
,
two
gammaretroviruses
,
are
also
the
result
of
a
transspecies
transmission
,
however
from
a
still
unknown
host
.

Related
retroviruses
have
been
found
in
Southeast
Asian
mice
although
the
sequence
similarity
was
limited
.

Viruses
with
a
higher
sequence
homology
were
isolated
from
Melomys
burtoni
,
the
Australian
and
Indonesian
grassland
melomys
.

However
,
only
the
habitats
of
the
koalas
and
the
grassland
melomys
in
Australia
are
overlapping
,
indicating
that
the
melomys
virus
may
not
be
the
precursor
of
the
GaLV
.

Viruses
closely
related
to
GaLV/KoRV
were
also
detected
in
bats
.

Therefore
,
given
the
fact
that
the
habitats
of
the
gibbons
in
Thailand
and
the
koalas
in
Australia
are
far
away
,
and
that
bats
are
able
to
fly
over
long
distances
,
the
hypothesis
that
retroviruses
of
bats
are
the
origin
of
GaLV
and
KoRV
deserves
consideration
.

Analysis
of
previous
transspecies
transmissions
of
retroviruses
may
help
to
evaluate
the
potential
of
transmission
of
related
retroviruses
in
the
future
,
e.g.
,
that
of
porcine
endogenous
retroviruses
(
PERVs
)
during
xenotransplantation
using
pig
cells
,
tissues
or
organs
.

A
rapid
,
cost-effective
diagnostic
test
for
the
detection
of
acute
HIV-1
infection
is
highly
desired
.

Isothermal
amplification
techniques
,
such
as
reverse-transcription
loop-mediated
isothermal
amplification
(
RT-LAMP
)
,
exhibit
characteristics
that
are
ideal
for
the
development
of
a
rapid
nucleic
acid
amplification
test
(
NAAT
)
because
they
are
quick
,
easy
to
perform
and
do
not
require
complex
,
dedicated
equipment
and
laboratory
space
.

In
this
study
,
we
assessed
the
ability
of
the
HIV-1
RT-LAMP
assay
to
detect
acute
HIV
infection
as
compared
to
a
representative
rapid
antibody
test
and
several
FDA-approved
laboratory-based
assays
.

The
HIV-1
RT-LAMP
assay
detected
seroconverting
individuals
one
to
three
weeks
earlier
than
a
rapid
HIV
antibody
test
and
up
to
two
weeks
earlier
than
a
lab-based
antigen/antibody
(
Ag/Ab
)
combo
enzyme
immunoassay
(
EIA
)
.

RT-LAMP
was
not
as
sensitive
as
a
labbased
qualitative
RNA
assay
,
which
could
be
attributed
to
the
significantly
smaller
nucleic
acid
input
volume
.

To
our
knowledge
,
this
is
the
first
demonstration
of
detecting
acute
HIV
infection
using
the
RT-LAMP
assay
.

The
availability
of
a
rapid
NAAT
,
such
as
the
HIV-1
RT-LAMP
assay
,
at
the
point
of
care
(
POC
)
or
in
laboratories
that
do
not
have
access
to
large
platform
NAAT
could
increase
the
percentage
of
individuals
who
receive
an
acute
HIV
infection
status
or
confirmation
of
their
HIV
status
,
while
immediately
linking
them
to
counseling
and
medical
care
.

In
addition
,
early
knowledge
of
HIV
status
could
lead
to
reduced
high-risk
behavior
at
a
time
when
individuals
are
at
a
higher
risk
for
transmitting
the
virus
.

The
etiology
of
Kawasaki
disease
(
KD
)
,
the
leading
cause
of
acquired
heart
disease
in
children
,
is
currently
unknown
.

Epidemiology
supports
a
relationship
of
KD
to
an
infectious
disease
.

Several
pathological
mechanisms
are
being
considered
,
including
a
superantigen
response
,
direct
invasion
by
an
infectious
etiology
or
an
autoimmune
phenomenon
.

Treating
affected
patients
with
intravenous
immunoglobulin
is
effective
at
reducing
the
rates
of
coronary
aneurysms
.

However
,
the
role
of
B
cells
and
antibodies
in
KD
pathogenesis
remains
unclear
.

Murine
models
are
not
clear
on
the
role
for
B
cells
and
antibodies
in
pathogenesis
.

Studies
on
rare
aneurysm
specimens
reveal
plasma
cell
infiltrates
.

Antibodies
generated
from
these
aneurysmal
plasma
cell
infiltrates
showed
cross-reaction
to
intracellular
inclusions
in
the
bronchial
epithelium
of
a
number
of
pathologic
specimens
from
children
with
KD
.

These
antibodies
have
not
defined
an
etiology
.

Notably
,
a
number
of
autoantibody
responses
have
been
reported
in
children
with
KD
.

Recent
studies
show
acute
B
cell
responses
are
similar
in
children
with
KD
compared
to
children
with
infections
,
lending
further
support
of
an
infectious
disease
cause
of
KD
.

Here
,
we
will
review
and
discuss
the
inconsistencies
in
the
literature
in
relation
to
B
cell
responses
,
specific
antibodies
,
and
a
potential
role
for
humoral
immunity
in
KD
pathogenesis

diagnosis
.

Background
:
Although
there
was
a
report
about
the
seasonal
variation
in
Wuhan
city
,
it
only
analyzed
the
prevalence
data
of
pulmonary
tuberculosis
(
TB
)
cases
,
and
just
studied
the
seasonality
by
subgroup
of
smear
positive
and
negative
from
2006
to
2010
by
spectral
analysis
.

In
this
study
,
we
investigated
the
seasonality
of
the
total
newly
notified
pulmonary
TB
cases
by
subgroups
such
as
time
period
,
sex
,
age
,
occupation
,
district
,
and
sputum
smear
result
from
2004
to
2013
in
Wuhan
by
a
popular
seasonal
adjustment
model
(
TRAMO-SEATS
)
.

Methods
:
Monthly
pulmonary
TB
cases
from
2004
to
2013
in
Wuhan
were
analyzed
by
the
TRAMO-SEATS
seasonal
adjustment
program
.

Seasonal
amplitude
was
calculated
and
compared
within
the
subgroups
.

Results
:
From
2004
to
2013
,
there
were
77.76
thousand
newly
notified
pulmonary
TB
cases
in
Wuhan
,
China
.

There
was
a
dominant
peak
spring
peak
(
March
)
with
seasonal
amplitude
of
56.81
%
and
a
second
summer
peak
(
September
)
of
43.40
%
,
compared
with
the
trough
month
(
December
)
.

The
spring
seasonal
amplitude
in
2004-2008
was
higher
than
that
of
2009-2013
(
P,0.05
)
.

There
were
no
statistical
differences
for
spring
seasonal
amplitude
within
subgroups
of
gender
,
age
,
district
,
and
sputum
smear
result
(
P.0.05
)
.

However
,
there
were
significant
differences
in
spring
seasonal
amplitude
by
occupation
,
with
amplitude
ranging
from
59.37
%
to
113.22
%
(
P,0.05
)
.

The
summer
seasonal
amplitude
in
2004-2008
was
higher
than
that
of
2009-2013
(
P,0.05
)
.

There
were
no
statistical
differences
in
summer
seasonal
amplitude
within
subgroups
of
gender
,
district
,
sputum
smear
result
(
P.0.05
)
.

There
were
significant
differences
in
summer
seasonal
amplitude
by
age
,
with
amplitude
ranging
from
36.05
%
to
100.09
%
(
P,0.05
)
.

Also
,
there
were
significant
differences
in
summer
seasonal
amplitude
by
occupation
,
with
amplitude
ranging
from
43.40
%
to
109.88
%
(
P,0.05
)
.

Conclusions
:
There
was
an
apparent
seasonal
variation
in
pulmonary
TB
cases
in
Wuhan
.

We
speculated
that
spring
peak
in
our
study
was
most
likely
caused
by
the
increased
reactivation
of
the
latent
TB
due
to
vitamin
D
deficiency
and
high
PM2.5
concentration
,
while
the
summer
peak
was
mainly
resulted
from
the
enhanced
winter
transmission
due
to
indoor
crowding
in
winter
,
overcrowding
of
public
transportation
over
the
period
of
the
Spring
Festival
and
health
care
seeking
delay
in
winter
.

Infected
people
are
isolated
to
minimize
the
spread
of
pandemic
diseases
.

Therefore
,
the
factors
related
to
self-isolation
(
SI
)
should
not
be
neglected
,
and
it
is
important
to
investigate
the
factors
leading
the
infected
(
or
possibly
infected
)
people
to
choose
to
self-isolate
.

In
this
paper
,
we
tried
to
show
that
the
theory
of
planned
behavior
provides
a
useful
conceptual
framework
for
SI
when
facing
a
pandemic
risk
,
and
a
regression
method
with
Chinese
provincial
(
Guangdong
Province
)
data
was
applied
to
investigate
how
attitude
(
ATT
)
,
subjective
norms
(
SN
)
,
and
perceived
behavioral
control
(
PBC
)
influence
SI
when
facing
a
pandemic
emergency
.

The
results
and
the
robustness
tests
confirm
that
ATT
,
SN
,
and
PBC
have
a
significant
positive
influence
on
SI
when
facing
a
pandemic
emergency
.

ATT
plays
the
most
important
role
,
followed
by
SN
and
then
PBC
.

Based
on
the
factors
of
SI
,
we
found
,
through
theoretical
and
empirical
analyses
,
at
least
three
important
aspects
that
local
governments
need
to
consider
to
encourage
citizens
to
self-isolate
when
facing
a
pandemic
.

The
massive
abundance
of
studies
relating
to
tropical
medicine
and
health
has
increased
strikingly
over
the
last
few
decades
.

In
the
field
of
tropical
medicine
and
health
,
a
well-conducted
systematic
review
and
meta-analysis
(
SR/MA
)
is
considered
a
feasible
solution
for
keeping
clinicians
abreast
of
current
evidence-based
medicine
.

Understanding
of
SR/MA
steps
is
of
paramount
importance
for
its
conduction
.

It
is
not
easy
to
be
done
as
there
are
obstacles
that
could
face
the
researcher
.

To
solve
those
hindrances
,
this
methodology
study
aimed
to
provide
a
step-by-step
approach
mainly
for
beginners
and
junior
researchers
,
in
the
field
of
tropical
medicine
and
other
health
care
fields
,
on
how
to
properly
conduct
a
SR/MA
,
in
which
all
the
steps
here
depicts
our
experience
and
expertise
combined
with
the
already
well-known
and
accepted
international
guidance
.

We
suggest
that
all
steps
of
SR/MA
should
be
done
independently
by
2-3
reviewers
'
discussion
,
to
ensure
data
quality
and
accuracy
.

Since
the
recognition
of
hantavirus
as
the
agent
responsible
for
haemorrhagic
fever
in
Eurasia
in
the
1970s
and
,
20
years
later
,
the
descovery
of
hantavirus
pulmonary
syndrome
in
the
Americas
,
the
genus
Hantavirus
has
been
continually
described
throughout
the
World
in
a
variety
of
wild
animals
.

The
diversity
of
wild
animals
infected
with
hantaviruses
has
only
recently
come
into
focus
as
a
result
of
expanded
wildlife
studies
.

The
known
reservoirs
are
more
than
80
,
belonging
to
51
species
of
rodents
,
7
bats
(
order
Chiroptera
)
and
20
shrews
and
moles
(
order
Soricomorpha
)
.

More
than
80genetically
related
viruses
have
been
classified
within
Hantavirus
genus
;
25
recognized
as
human
pathogens
responsible
for
a
large
spectrum
of
diseases
in
the
Old
and
New
World
.

In
Brazil
,
where
the
diversity
of
mammals
and
especially
rodents
is
considered
one
of
the
largest
in
the
world
,
9
hantavirus
genotypes
have
been
identified
in
12
rodent
species
belonging
to
the
genus
Akodon
,
Calomys
,
Holochilus
,
Oligoryzomys
,
Oxymycterus
,
Necromys
and
Rattus
.

Considering
the
increasing
number
of
animals
that
have
been
implicated
as
reservoirs
of
different
hantaviruses
,
the
understanding
of
this
diversity
is
important
for
evaluating
the
risk
of
distinct
hantavirus
species
as
human
pathogens

The
clinical
consequences
of
co-infection
with
two
or
more
respiratory
viruses
are
poorly
understood
.

We
sought
to
determine
if

influenza
A
H1N1
(
pH1N1
)
and
another
respiratory

Methods
:
A

72
hours
of
admission
at
our
institution
from
October
2009
to
December
2009
.

We
compared
patients
infected
with
one
respiratory
virus
to
those
with
respiratory
viral
co-infection
.

We
identified
617
inpatients
with
a
positive
RVP
sample
with
a

virus
and
49
inpatients
with
a
positive
RVP
sample
for
two
viruses
(
i.e

)
.

Co-infected
patients
were
significantly
younger
,
more
often
had
fever/chills
,
tachypnea
,
and
they
more
often
demonstrated
interstitial
opacities
suggestive
of
viral
pneumonia
on
the

were
similar
in
both

,
but
patients
with

were
more

to
experience
complications
,

.

Patients
co-infected
with

were
more

to
present

.

By
logistic
regression
using
monoinfection
with
non-PH1N1
viruses
as
the
reference
group
,
co-infection
with

was
the
strongest
independent
predictor
of
treatment
for
a
secondary
bacterial
pneumonia
(

.

Patients
with
viral
co-infection
,

were
more
likely
to
have
chest
radiograph
features

with
a
viral
pneumonia
and
complications
during
their
hospital
course
,
particularly

Despite
this
,
co-infection
was
not

Mutations
in
PITX2

In

the
most

to
assess
the

The
MutPred

Background
:
The
European
Union
(
EU
)
health
mandate
was
initially
defined
in
the
Maastricht
Treaty
in
1992
.

The
twentieth
anniversary
of
the
Treaty
offers
a
unique
opportunity
to
take
stock
of
EU
health
actions
by
giving
an
overview
of
influential
public
health
related
EU-level
policy
outputs
and
a
summary
of
policy
outputs
or
actions
perceived
as
an
achievement
,
a
failure
or
a
missed
opportunity
.

Methods
:
Semi-structured
expert
interviews
(
N
=
20
)
were
conducted
focusing
on
EU-level
actions
that
were
relevant
for
health
.

Respondents
were
asked
to
name
EU
policies
or
actions
that
they
perceived
as
an
achievement
,
a
failure
or
a
missed
opportunity
.

A
directed
content
analysis
approach
was
used
to
identify
expert
perceptions
on
achievements
,
failures
and
missed
opportunities
in
the
interviews
.

Additionally
,
a
nominal
group
technique
was
applied
to
identify
influential
and
public
health
relevant
EU-level
policy
outputs
.

Results
:
The
ranking
of
influential
policy
outputs
resulted
in
top
positions
of
adjudications
and
legislations
,
agencies
,
European
Commission
(
EC
)
programmes
and
strategies
,
official
networks
,
cooperative
structures
and
exchange
efforts
,
the
work
on
health
determinants
and
uptake
of
scientific
knowledge
.

The
assessment
of
EU
health
policies
as
being
an
achievement
,
a
failure
or
a
missed
opportunity
was
often
characterized
by
diverging
respondent
views
.

Recurring
topics
that
emerged
were
the
Directorate
General
for
Health
and
Consumers
(
DG
SANCO
)
,
EU
agencies
,
life
style
factors
,
internal
market
provisions
as
well
as
the
EU
Directive
on
patients
'
rights
in
cross-border
healthcare
.

Among
these
recurring
topics
,
expert
perceptions
on
the
establishment
of
DG
SANCO
,
EU
public
health
agencies
,
and
successes
in
tobacco
control
were
dominated
by
aspects
of
achievements
.

The
implementation
status
of
the
Health
in
All
Policy
approach
was
perceived
as
a
missed
opportunity
.

Conclusions
:
When
comparing
the
emerging
themes
from
the
interviews
conducted
with
the
responsibilities
defined
in
the
EU
health
mandate
,
one
can
identify
that
these
responsibilities
were
only
partly
fulfilled
or
acknowledged
by
the
respondents
.

In
general
,
the
EU
is
a
recognized
public
health
player
in
Europe
which
over
the
past
two
decades
,
has
begun
to
develop
competencies
in
supporting
,
coordinating
and
supplementing
member
state
health
actions
.

However
,
the
assurance
of
health
protection
in
other
European
policies
seems
to
require
further
development
.

Chitin-binding
lectins
form
the
hevein
family
in
plants
,
which
are
defined
by
the
presence
of
single
or
multiple
structurally
conserved
GlcNAc
(
N-acetylglucosamine
)
-binding
domains
.

Although
they
have
been
used
as
probes
for
chito-oligosaccharides
,
their
detailed
specificities
remain
to
be
investigated
.

In
this
study
,
we
analyzed
six
chitin-binding
lectins
,
DSA
,
LEL
,
PWM
,
STL
,
UDA
,
and
WGA
,
by
quantitative
frontal
affinity

.

Some
novel
features
were
evident
:
WGA
showed
almost
comparable
affinity
for
pyridylaminated
chitotriose
and
chitotetraose
,
while
LEL
and
UDA
showed
much
weaker
affinity
,
and
DSA
,
PWM
,
and
STL
had
no
substantial
affinity
for
the
former
.

WGA
showed
selective
affinity
for
hybrid-type
N-glycans
harboring
a
bisecting
GlcNAc
residue
.

UDA
showed
extensive
binding
to
high-mannose
type
N-glycans
,
with
affinity
increasing
with
the
number
of
Man
residues
.

DSA
showed
the
highest
affinity
for
highly
branched
N-glycans
consisting
of
type
II
LacNAc
(
N-acetyllactosamine
)
.

Further
,
multivalent
features
of
these
lectins
were
investigated
by
using
glycoconjugate
and
lectin
microarrays
.

The
lectins
showed
substantial
binding
to
immobilized
LacNAc
as
well
as
chito-oligosaccharides
,
although
the
extents
to
which
they
bound
varied
among
them
.

WGA
showed
strong
binding
to
heavily
sialylated
glycoproteins
.

The
above
observations

interpret
lectin-glycoprotein
interactions

The
historical
role
of
mitochondria
resides
in
converting
the
energy
released
during
the
oxidation
of
macromolecules
(
carbohydrates
,
lipids
and
proteins
)
into
adenosine
tri-phosphate
,
a
major
form
of
chemically
stored
energy
which
sustains
cell
growth
and
homeostasis
.

Beyond
this
role
in
bioenergetics
regulation
,
mitochondria
play
a
role
in
several
other
cellular
processes
including
lipid
metabolism
,
cellular
calcium
homeostasis
,
autophagy
and
immune
responses
.

Furthermore
,
mitochondria
are
highly
dynamic
organelles
:
as
all
other
cellular
endomembranes
,
they
are
continuously
moving
along
cytoskeleton
,
and
,
most
importantly
,
they
constantly
interact
one
with
each
other
by
membrane
tethering
,
fusion
and
fission
.

This
review
aims
to
highlight
the
tight
correlation
between
the
morphodynamics
of
mitochondria
and
their
biological
function
(
s
)
,
in
physiological
as
well
as
stress
conditions
,
in
particular
nutrient
deprivation
,
pathogen
attack
and
some
human
diseases
.

Finally
,
we
emphasize
some
crosstalk
between
the
fusion/fission
machinery
and
the
autophagy
pathway
to
ending
on
some
speculative
hypothesis
to
inspire
future
research
in
the
field

mediates
the
fusion
of
the
inner
mitochondrial
membranes
(
MIM
)
.

These
two
phases
are
coordinated
and
occur
almost
simultaneously
(
Figure

)
.

Mitofusins
were
first
described
to
be
required
for
MT
fusion
in
drosophila
[
4
]
and
yeast
[
5
]
.

In
mammals
,
mouse
knockout
models
illustrate
their
importance
in
fusion
.

Indeed
,
deficient
mouse
embryonic
fibroblasts
(
MEFs
)
in
either
Mfn1
or
Mfn2

to
the
tubular
and
interconnected
mitochondrial
network
observed
in
wild-type
(
WT
)
cells
[

]
.

Beside
its
role
in
MT
fusion
,
MFN
2
is
also
implicated
in
the
formation
of
Endoplasmic
Reticulum
(

)
-MT
contact
sites
[

and

.

The
mechanism
by
which
mitofusins
mediate
MT
fusion
is
not
fully
understood
,
although
it
was
suggested
that
MFN
1
and
MFN
2
form
homo-or
hetero-oligomeric
complexes
by
interacting
in
trans
between
neighbouring
mitochondria
,
thereby
promoting
their
tethering
and
subsequent
fusion
of
OPA1

whose
gene
mutation

and
disorganization
of

,
altered

and
increased

.

Different
isoforms
of
OPA1
arise
through
differential
RNA
splicing
and
protein
processing
.

Importantly
,
it
has
been
shown
that
MT
fusion
depends
on
a
proper
ratio
between
two
major
forms
of
OPA1
:
The
Long
(
L-OPA1
)
and
Short
(

)

In
fact
,
L-OPA1
is
associated
with
efficient
MT

be

by
the
ATP-dependent
protease
YME1L
and
the
membrane
potential-dependent
protease
OMA1
(
metallopeptidase
Overlapping
with
the
m-AAA
protease1
)
.

Thus
,
proteolysis
via
Yme1L
is
responsible
for
oxidative
phosphorylation-dependent
stimulation
of
inner-membrane
fusion
.

In
contrast

the
dissipation

subsequent
cleavage
and
inactivation
of

Various
cellular
stresses
can
activate
Oma1
to
cleave
Opa1
[

Cells
in
which

expression
is

recovered

more
quickly
than
control
cells
after

)
and
became
less
sensitive
to
staurosporine-induced
apoptosis
[
15
]
,
suggesting
that
,
in
these
conditions
,
OMA1
regulates
the
functions
of
the
dynamin
by
modulating
the
abundance
of
the
L-isoform
[
15
]
.

This
mechanism
likely
contributes
to
the
mitochondrial
fragmentation
observed
in
different
forms
of
mitochondrial
dysfunction
[
16
]
.

In
addition
to
proteolytic
regulation
of
OPA1
,
some
post-translational
modifications
have
also
been
described
.

In
neonatal
cardiac
myocytes
,
high-glucose
exposure
triggers
increased
O-GlcNAcylation
of
OPA1
,
leading
to
mitochondrial
dysfunction
by
increasing
mitochondrial
fragmentation
[
17
]
.

Moreover
,
prolonged
treatment
of
rat
kidney
proximal
tubular
cells
by
prostaglandin
showed
that
OPA1
is
subjected
to
ubiquitination
and
subsequent
degradation
[
18
]
.

In
the
context
of
heart
pathological
stress
,
OPA1
is
hyperacetylated
and
inactivated
[
19
]
.

It
has
been
shown
that
the
mitochondrial
deacetylase
SIRT3
was
capable
of
deacetylating
OPA1
and
elevating
its
GTPase
activity
.

SIRT3-dependent
activation
of
OPA1
contributes
to
the
preservation
of
mitochondrial
networking
and
protection
of
cardiomyocytes
from
doxorubicin-mediated
cell
death

On

In

,
the
GTPase
dynamin-related
protein
1
(

)
[

,
is
described
to
be
the
major
effector
of
this

.

Considering
the
cytosolic
localization
of
this

its
recruitment
to
the
mitochondrial
surface
requires
specific
adaptor

Antiviral

All
tested
drugs
interacted
in
a
dosedependent
manner
with

,
thereby
inactivating
viral
infectivity

Star

,
rich
in

,
revealed
a
high
selectivity
index
of
160
against

whereas
among
the
isolated
compounds
only
β-caryophyllene
displayed
a
high
selectivity
index
of
140

The
presence
of
β-caryophyllene
in
many
essential
oils
might
contribute
strongly
to
their
antiviral
ability
.

These
results
indicate
that
phenylpropanoids

sesquiterpenes
present
in
essential

contribute
to
their
antiviral

Non-typeable
Haemophilus

(

)
is
commonly
associated
with
chronic
suppurative
lung
disease
in
children
.

We
have
previously
shown
that
children
with
chronic
suppurative
lung
disease
have
a
reduced
capacity
to
produce
IFN-γ
in
response
to
NTHi
compared
with
healthy
control
children
.

The
aim
of
this
study
was
to
determine
if
deficient
NTHi-specific
IFN-γ
production
is
associated
with
heightened
systemic
or
airway
inflammation
.

We
measured
a
panel
of
cytokines
(
IFN-γ
,
IL-1β
,
IL-6
,
IL-8
,

as
well
as
cellular
and
clinical
factors
associated
with
airway
and
systemic
inflammation
in
70
children
with
chronic
suppurative
lung
disease
.

IFN-γ
was
measured
in
peripheral
blood
mononuclear
cells
challenged
in

with
live
NTHi
.

Regression
analysis
was
used
to
assess
the
association
between
the
systemic
and
airway
inflammation
and
the
capacity
to
produce
IFN-γ
.

On
multivariate
regression
,
NTHi-specific
IFN-γ
production
was
significantly
negatively
associated
with
the
BAL
concentrations
of
the
inflammatory
cytokines
IL-6
(

.

This
association
was
independent
of
bacterial
or
viral
infection
,
BAL
cellularity
and
the
severity
of

.

We
found
limited
evidence
of
systemic
inflammation
in
children
with
chronic
suppurative
lung
disease
.

In
summary
,
increased
local
airway
inflammation
is
associated
with
a
poorer
systemic
cell-mediated
immune
response
to
NTHi
in
children
with
chronic
suppurative
lung
disease
.

These
data
support
the
emerging
body
of
evidence
that
impaired
cell-mediated
immune
responses
and
dysregulated
airway
inflammation
may
be
linked
and
contribute
to
the
pathobiology
of
chronic
suppurative

Background
:
Primary
ciliary
dyskinesia
(
PCD
)
is
a
rare
congenital
respiratory
disorder
characterized
by
abnormal
ciliary
motility
leading
to
chronic
airway
infections
.

Qualitative
evaluation
of
ciliary
beat
pattern
based
on
digital
high-speed
videomicroscopy
analysis
has
been
proposed
in
the
diagnosis
process
of
PCD
.

Although
this
evaluation
is
easy
in
typical
cases
,
it
becomes
difficult
when
ciliary
beating
is
partially
maintained
.

We
postulated
that
a
quantitative
analysis
of
beat
pattern
would
improve
PCD
diagnosis
.

We
compared
quantitative
parameters
with
the
qualitative
evaluation
of
ciliary
beat
pattern
in
patients
in
whom
the
diagnosis
of
PCD
was
confirmed
or
excluded
.

Methods
:
Nasal
nitric
oxide
measurement
,
nasal
brushings
and
biopsies
were
performed
prospectively
in
34
patients
with
suspected
PCD
.

In
combination
with
qualitative
analysis
,
12
quantitative
parameters
of
ciliary
beat
pattern
were
determined
on
high-speed
videomicroscopy
recordings
of
beating
ciliated
edges
.

The
combination
of
ciliary
ultrastructural
abnormalities
on
transmission

microscopy
analysis
with
low
nasal
nitric
oxide
levels
was
the
``
gold
standard
''
used
to
establish
the
diagnosis
of
PCD
.

Results
:
This
``
gold
standard
''
excluded
PCD
in
15
patients
(
non-PCD
patients
)
,
confirmed
PCD
in
10
patients
(
PCD
patients
)
and
was
inconclusive
in
9
patients
.

Among
the
12
parameters
,
the
distance
traveled
by
the
cilium
tip
weighted
by
the
percentage
of
beating
ciliated
edges
presented
96
%
sensitivity
and
95
%
specificity
.

Qualitative
evaluation
and
quantitative
analysis
were
concordant
in
non-PCD
patients
.

In
9/10
PCD
patients
,
quantitative
analysis
was
concordant
with
the
``
gold
standard
''
,
while
the
qualitative
evaluation
was
discordant
with
the
``
gold
standard
''
in
3/10
cases
.

Among
the
patients
with
an
inconclusive
``
gold
standard
''
,
the
use
of
quantitative
parameters
supported
PCD
diagnosis
in
4/9
patients
(
confirmed
by
the
identification
of
disease-causing
mutations
in
one
patient
)
and
PCD
exclusion
in
2/9
patients
.

Conclusions
:
When
the
beat
pattern
is
normal
or
virtually
immotile
,
the
qualitative
evaluation
is
adequate
to
study
ciliary
beating
in
patients
suspected
for
PCD
.

However
,
when
cilia
are
still
beating
but
with
moderate
alterations
(
more
than
40
%
of
patients
suspected
for
PCD
)
,
quantitative
analysis
is
required
to
precise
the
diagnosis
and
can
be
proposed
to
select
patients
eligible
for

because
they
serve
as

Infection
with
recombinant
hepatotropic
adenoviruses
coding
for
molecular
markers
such
as
luciferase
and
GFP
lead
to
liver/hepatocyte-targeted
infection
,
as
determined
by
in

bioluminescence
measurement
of
luciferase
activity
and
detection
of
GFP
in
around
50
%
of

by
liver
immunohistochemistry
(

and

)
.

Studying
mitochondrial
morphological
characteristics
in
hepatocytes
by
ultrastructural
analysis
with
transmission
electron
microscopy
proved
difficult
,
because
it
would
require
analysis
of
serial
sections
and
simultaneous
detection
of
infecting
adenovirus
,
which
is
impossible
as
recombinant
adenoviruses
are
replication-deficient
and
detection
of
few
incoming
virus
particles
per
cell
is
very
demanding
(
Fig
.

1C
)
.

We
therefore
purified
mitochondria
from
homogenized
liver
tissue
by
discontinuous
percoll
density
gradient
centrifugation
,
which
yielded
pure
mitochondrial
preparations
as
determined
by
immunoblot
analysis
(
Fig
.

1D
and
15
)
.

Ultrastructural
analysis
of
these
purified
mitochondria
by
electron
microscopy
yielded
heterogeneous
results
with
respect
to
morphology
and
size
(
Fig
.

1E
)
again
with
the
uncertainty
of
whether
mitochondria
where
derived
from
infected
or
non-infected
cells
.

Flow
cytometry
is
a
methodology
that
can
be
employed
to
sensitively
detect
and
analyse
mitochondria
with
the
advantage
of
quantitative
characterization
of
large
numbers
of
mitochondria
[
16
]
[
17
]
[
18
]
[
19
]
.

This
prompted
us
to
use
flow
cytometry
to
determine
directly
ex
vivo
physical
parameters
of
mitochondria
at
the
level
of
single
organelles
.

Purified
mitochondria
were
reliable
detectable
by
forward
scatter
and
side
scatter
analysis
in
flow
cytometry
(
Fig
.

1F
)
.

Staining
with
MitoTracker
Green
confirmed
that
isolation
from
liver
tissue
by
density-gradient
centrifugation
yielded
highly
pure
mitochondria
(
Fig
.

1F
)
.

We
therefore
conclude
that
flow
cytometry
is
a
suitable
method
to
analyse
mitochondrial
properties
after
viral
infection
.

among
registered
migrant
TB
patients
in
China
(
2014-15
)
who
were
transferred
out
(
during
treatment
)
through
web-based
TB
information
management
system
(
TBIMS
)
.

Methods
:
This
was
a
cross
sectional
study
involving
review
of
TBIMS
data
.

Delays
(
in
days
)
were
classified
as
follows
:
patient
delay
(
from
symptom
onset
to
first
doctor
visit
)
,
health
system
delay
(
from
first
doctor

to
treatment
initiation
,
divided
into
health
system
diagnosis
and
treatment
delay
before
and
after
date
of
diagnosis
respectively
)
,
diagnosis
delay
(
from
symptom
onset
to
diagnosis
)
and
total
delay
(
from
symptom
onset
to
treatment
initiation
)
.

Linear
regression
was
used
to
build
a
predictive
model
(
forward
stepwise
)
for
the
socio-demographic
,
clinical
and
health
system
related
factors
associated
with
delay
:
one
model
for
each
type
of
delay
.

Delays
were
log
transformed
and
included
in
the
model
.

The
median
(
IQR
)
patient
delay
,
health
system
delay
and
total
delay
was
16
(
6
,
34
)
,
two
(
0
,
6
)
and
22
(
11
,
41
)
days
respectively
.

Factors
associated
with
long
patient
,
diagnosis
and
total
delay
were
:
female
gender
,
age
≥
65
years
,
sputum
smear
positive
pulmonary
TB
and
registration
at
referral
hospital
.

Treatment
initiation
delay
was
significantly
higher
among
those
registered
in
referral
hospitals
,
unemployed
and
previously
treated
.

Among
migrant
patients
having
permanent
residence
out
of
province
,
health
system
diagnosis
delay
was
significantly
higher
while
treatment
initiation
delay
after
diagnosis
was
significantly
lower
when
compared
to
patients
having
permanent
residence
within
the
prefecture
.

Conclusion
:
Among
migrant
population
with
TB
,
patient
delay
contributed
to
the
total
delay
.

The
factors
identified
including
the
need
for
improved
coordination
between
referral
hospitals
and
national
programme
have
to
be
addressed
if
China
has
to
end

Pneumonia
is
the
leading
cause
of
death
among
children
less
than
5
years
old
worldwide
.

A
wide
range
of
viral
,
bacterial
and
fungal
agents
can
cause
pneumonia
:
although
viruses
are
the
most
common
etiologic
agent
,
the
severity
of
clinical
symptoms
associated
with
bacterial
pneumonia
and
increasing
antibiotic
resistance
makes
bacterial
pneumonia
a
major
public
health
concern
.

Bacterial
pneumonia
can
follow
upper
respiratory
viral
infection
and
complicate
lower
respiratory
viral
infection
.

Secondary
bacterial
pneumonia
is
a
major
cause
of
influenza-related
deaths
.

In
this
review
,
we
evaluate
the
following
hypotheses
:
(
i
)
respiratory
viruses
influence
the
etiology
of
pneumonia
by
altering
bacterial
community
structure
in
the
upper
respiratory
tract
(
URT
)
and
(
ii
)
respiratory
viruses
promote
or
inhibit
colonization
of
the
lower
respiratory
tract
(
LRT
)
by
certain
bacterial
species
residing
in
the
URT
.

We
conducted
a
systematic
review
of
the
literature
to
examine
temporal
associations
between
respiratory
viruses
and
bacteria
and
a
targeted
review
to
identify
potential
mechanisms
of
interactions
.

We
conclude
that
viruses
both
alter
the
bacterial
community
in
the
URT
and
promote
bacterial
colonization
of
the
LRT
.

However
,
it
is
uncertain
whether
changes
in
the
URT
bacterial
community
play
a
substantial
role
in
pneumonia
etiology
.

The
exception
is
Streptococcus
pneumoniae
where
a
strong
link
between
viral
co-infection
,
increased
carriage
and
pneumococcal
pneumonia
has
been
established

Background
:
Viral
infections
often
pose
tremendous
public
health
concerns
as
well
as
economic
burdens
.

Despite
the
availability
of
vaccines
or
antiviral
drugs
,
personal
hygiene
is
considered
as
effective
means
as
the
first-hand
measure
against
viral
infections
.

The
green
tea
catechins
,
in
particular
,
epigallocatechin-3-gallate
(
EGCG
)
,
are
known
to
exert
potent
antiviral
activity
.

In
this
study
,
we
evaluated
the
green
tea
extract
as
a
safe
personal
hygiene
against
viral
infections
.

Results
:
Using
the
influenza
virus
A/Puerto
Rico/8/34
(
H1N1
)
as
a
model
,
we
examined
the
duration
of
the
viral
inactivating
activity
of
green
tea
extract
(
GTE
)
under
prolonged
storage
at
various
temperature
conditions
.

Even
after
the
storage
for
56
days
at
different
temperatures
,
0.1
%
GTE
completely
inactivated
10
6
PFU
of
the
virus
(
6
log
10
reduction
)
,
and
0.01
%
and
0.05
%
GTE
resulted
in
2
log
10
reduction
of
the
viral
titers
.

When
supplemented
with
2
%
citric
acid
,
0.1
%
sodium
benzoate
,
and
0.2
%
ascorbic
acid
as
anti-oxidant
,
the
inactivating
activity
of
GTE
was
temporarily
compromised
during
earlier
times
of
storage
.

However
,
the
antiviral
activity
of
the
GTE
was
steadily
recovered
up
to
similar
levels
with
those
of
the
same
concentrations
of
GTE
without
the
supplements
,
effectively
prolonging
the
duration
of
the
virucidal
function
over
extended
period
.

Cryo-EM
and
DLS
analyses
showed
a
slight
increase
in
the
overall
size
of
virus
particles
by
GTE
treatment
.

The
results
suggest
that
the
virucidal
activity
of
GTE
is
mediated
by
oxidative
crosslinking
of
catechins
to
the
viral
proteins
and
the
change
of
physical
properties
of
viral
membranes
.

Conclusions
:
The
durability
of
antiviral
effects
of
GTE
was
examined
as
solution
type
and
powder
types
over
extended
periods
at
various
temperature
conditions
using
human
influenza
A/H1N1
virus
.

GTE
with
supplements
demonstrated
potent
viral
inactivating
activity
,
resulting
in
greater
than
4
log
10
reduction
of
viral
titers
even
after
storage
for
up
to
two
months
at
a
wide
range
of
temperatures
.

These
data
suggest
that
GTE-based
antiviral
agents
could
be
formulated
as
a
safe
and
environmentally
friendly
personal
hygiene
against
viral
infections
.

In
this
study
,
we
report
for
the
first
time
the
existence
of
complemented
palindromic
small
RNAs
(
cpsRNAs
)
and
propose
that
cpsRNAs
and
palindromic
small
RNAs
(
psRNAs
)
constitute
a
novel
class
of
small
RNAs
.

The
first
discovered
19-nt
cpsRNA
UUAACAAGCUUGUUAAAGA
,
named
SARS-CoV-cpsR-19
,
was
detected
from
a
22-bp
DNA
complemented
palindrome
TCTTTAACAAGCTTGTTAAAGA
in
the
severe
acute
respiratory
syndrome
coronavirus
(
SARS-CoV
)
genome
.

The
phylogenetic
analysis
supported
that
this
DNA
complemented
palindrome
originated
from
bat
betacoronavirus
.

The
results
of
RNA
interference
(
RNAi
)
experiments
showed
that
one
19-nt
segment
corresponding
to
SARS-CoV-cpsR-19
significantly
induced
cell
apoptosis
.

Using
this
joint
analysis
of
the
molecular
function
and
phylogeny
,
our
results
suggested
that
SARS-CoV-cpsR-19
could
play
a
role
in
SARS-CoV
infection
or
pathogenesis
.

The
discovery
of
cpsRNAs
has
paved
a
way
to
find
novel
markers
for
pathogen
detection
and
to
reveal
the
mechanisms
underlying
infection
or
pathogenesis
from
a
different
point
of
view
.

Researchers
can
use
cpsRNAs
to
study
the
infection
or
pathogenesis
of
pathogenic
viruses
when
these
viruses
are
not
available
.

The
discovery
of
psRNAs
and
cpsRNAs
,
as
a
novel
class
of
small
RNAs
,
also
inspire
researchers
to
investigate
DNA
palindromes
and
DNA
complemented
palindromes
with
lengths
of
psRNAs
and
cpsRNAs
in
viral
genomes
.

Background
:
Prior
to
emergence
in
human
populations
,
zoonoses
such
as
SARS
cause
occasional
infections
in
human
populations
exposed
to
reservoir
species
.

The
risk
of
widespread
epidemics
in
humans
can
be
assessed
by
monitoring
the
reproduction
number
R
(
average
number
of
persons
infected
by
a
human
case
)
.

However
,
until
now
,
estimating
R
required
detailed
outbreak
investigations
of
human
clusters
,
for
which
resources
and
expertise
are
not
always
available
.

Additionally
,
existing
methods
do
not
correct
for
important
selection
and
under-ascertainment
biases
.

Here
,
we
present
simple
estimation
methods
that
overcome
many
of
these
limitations
.

Our
approach
is
based
on
a
parsimonious
mathematical
model
of
disease
transmission
and
only
requires
data
collected
through
routine
surveillance
and
standard
case
investigations
.

We
apply
it
to
assess
the
transmissibility
of
swine-origin
influenza
A
H3N2v-M
virus
in
the
US
,
Nipah
virus
in
Malaysia
and
Bangladesh
,
and
also
present
a
non-zoonotic
example
(
cholera
in
the
Dominican
Republic
)
.

Estimation
is
based
on
two
simple
summary
statistics
,
the
proportion
infected
by
the
natural
reservoir
among
detected
cases
(
G
)
and
among
the
subset
of
the
first
detected
cases
in
each
cluster
(
F
)
.

If
detection
of
a
case
does
not
affect
detection
of
other
cases
from
the
same
cluster
,
we
find
that
R
can
be
estimated
by
12G
;
otherwise
R
can
be
estimated
by
12F
when
the
case
detection
rate
is
low
.

In
more
general
cases
,
bounds
on
R
can
still
be
derived
.

We
have
developed
a
simple
approach
with
limited
data
requirements
that
enables
robust
assessment
of
the
risks
posed
by
emerging
zoonoses
.

We
illustrate
this
by
deriving
transmissibility
estimates
for
the
H3N2v-M
virus
,
an
important
step
in
evaluating
the
possible
pandemic
threat
posed
by
this
virus
.

Turnip
yellow
mosaic
virus
(
TYMV
)
-a
member
of
the
alphavirus-like
supergroup
of
viruses
-serves
as
a
model
system
for
positive-stranded
RNA
virus
membrane-bound
replication
.

TYMV
encodes
a
precursor
replication
polyprotein
that
is
processed
by
the
endoproteolytic
activity
of
its
internal
cysteine
proteinase
domain
(
PRO
)
.

We
recently
reported
that
PRO
is
actually
a
multifunctional
enzyme
with
a
specific
ubiquitin
hydrolase
(
DUB
)
activity
that
contributes
to
viral
infectivity
.

Here
,
we
report
the
crystal
structure
of
the
150-residue
PRO
.

Strikingly
,
PRO
displays
no
homology
to
other
processing
proteinases
from
positive-stranded
RNA
viruses
,
including
that
of
alphaviruses
.

Instead
,
the
closest
structural
homologs
of
PRO
are
DUBs
from
the
Ovarian
tumor
(
OTU
)
family
.

In
the
crystal
,
one
molecule
's
C-terminus
inserts
into
the
catalytic
cleft
of
the
next
,
providing
a
view
of
the
N-terminal
product
complex
in
replication
polyprotein
processing
.

This
allows
us
to
locate
the
specificity
determinants
of
PRO
for
its
proteinase
substrates
.

In
addition
to
the
catalytic
cleft
,
at
the
exit
of
which
the
active
site
is
unusually
pared
down
and
solvent-exposed
,
a
key
element
in
molecular
recognition
by
PRO
is
a
lobe
N-terminal
to
the
catalytic
domain
.

Docking
models
and
the
activities
of
PRO
and
PRO
mutants
in
a
deubiquitylating
assay
suggest
that
this
N-terminal
lobe
is
also
likely
involved
in
PRO
's
DUB
function
.

Our
data
thus
establish
that
DUBs
can
evolve
to
specifically
hydrolyze
both
iso-and
endopeptide
bonds
with
different
sequences
.

This
is
achieved
by
the
use
of
multiple
specificity
determinants
,
as
recognition
of
substrate
patches
distant
from
the
cleavage
sites
allows
a
relaxed
specificity
of
PRO
at
the
sites
themselves
.

Our
results
thus
shed
light
on
how
such
a
compact
protein
achieves
a
diversity
of
key
functions
in
viral
genome
replication
and
host-pathogen
interaction
.

Polyamines
are
small
positively-charged
molecules
abundant
in
eukaryotic
cells
that
are
crucial
to
RNA
virus
replication
.

In
eukaryotic
cells
,
polyamines
facilitate
processes
such
as
transcription
,
translation
,
and
DNA
replication
,
and
viruses
similarly
rely
on
polyamines
to
facilitate
transcription
and
translation
.

Whether
polyamines
function
at
additional
stages
in
viral
replication
remains
poorly
understood
.

Picornaviruses
,
including
Coxsackievirus
B3
(
CVB3
)
,
are
sensitive
to
polyamine
depletion
both
in
vitro
and
in
vivo
;
however
,
precisely
how
polyamine
function
in
picornavirus
infection
has
not
been
described
.

Here
,
we
describe
CVB3
mutants
that
arise
with
passage
in
polyamine-depleted
conditions
.

We
observe
mutations
in
the
2A
and
3C
proteases
,
and
we
find
that
these
mutant
proteases
confer
resistance
to
polyamine
depletion
.

Using
a
split
luciferase
reporter
system
to
measure
protease
activity
,
we
determined
that
polyamines
facilitate
viral
protease
activity
.

We
further
observe
that
the
2A
and
3C
protease
mutations
enhance
reporter
protease
activity
in
polyamine-depleted
conditions

Finally
,
we
find
that
these
mutations
promote
cleavage
of

eIF4G
during
infection

.

In
sum
,
our
results
suggest
that
polyamines
are
crucial
to
protease
function
during
picornavirus
infection
.

Further
,
these
data
highlight
viral
proteases
as

antiviral
targets

how

antiviral
therapies
.

Viral
proteases
play
many
roles
during
infection
,
and
picornaviruses
encode
two
distinct
proteases
:
2A
(
2A
pro
)
and
3C
(
3C
pro
)
.

The
2A
and
3C
picornaviral
proteases
function
to
cleave
both
host
and
viral
proteins
.

3C
is
responsible
for
the
majority
of
viral
polyprotein
cleavage
.

Importantly
,
3C
also
functions
as
part
of
3CD
(
a
polyprotein
consisting
of
the
3C
protease
and
3D
polymerase
)
and
acts
as
a
protease
in
this
context
as
well
[

]
.

To
date
,
reports
demonstrated
that
2A
facilitates
the
cleavage
between
the
P1
and
P2
protein
segments
[

.

The
precise
regulation
of
these
proteases
,
their
activities
,
and
their
overlapping
and
unique
functions
remains
to
be
fully
understood
.

However
,
due
to
their
copious
functions
during
infection
,
they
represent
potential

Polyamines
are
small
,
positively-charged
molecules
that
are
abundant
in

Polyamines

Several

We
previously
described
how
Chikungunya
and
Zika
viruses
rely
on
polyamines
for
viral
translation
and
genome
replication
[

;
however
,
whether
similar
processes
are
affected
for
other
viruses
and
precisely
how
polyamines
function
during
CVB3
replication
remain
to
be
completely
understood
.

To
investigate
how
polyamines
facilitate
CVB3
infection
,
we
performed
a
screen
for
virus
escape
mutants
that
were
resistant
to
DFMO
treatment
.

We
isolated
two
distinct
viral
mutants
in
the
2A
and
3C
proteases
.

We
determined
that
these
mutant
viruses
were
resistant
to
polyamine
depletion
and
that
these
mutations
conferred
no
fitness
advantage
in
the
absence
of
polyamine
depletion
.

To
investigate
the
proteolytic
activity
of
these
enzymes
,
we
developed
a
protease-dependent
split-luciferase
reporter
system
to
measure
2A
and
3C
activity
.

Using
this
assay
,
we
observed
that
2A
and
3C
activity
was
diminished
with
polyamine
depletion
,
to
which
mutant
2A
and
3C
proteases
were
resistant
.

Additionally
,
we
observed
that
viruses
containing
these
mutants
were
able
to
cleave
cellular
targets
efficiently
in
polyamine-depleted
cells
.

Together
,
these
data
suggest
that
polyamines
are
crucial
for
viral
protease
activity
and
that
we
may
target
CVB3
proteolytic
activity
through
polyamine-depleting
pharmaceuticals
like
DFMO

Background
:
Penicillium
marneffei
is
the
most
important
thermal
dimorphic
fungus
causing
systemic
mycosis
in
China
and
Southeast
Asia
.

While
miRNAs
are
increasingly
recognized
for
their
roles
in
post-transcriptional
regulation
of
gene
expression
in
animals
and
plants
,
miRNAs
in
fungi
were
less
well
studied
and
their
potential
roles
in
fungal
dimorphism
were
largely
unknown
.

Based
on
P.
marneffei
genome
sequence
,
we
hypothesize
that
miRNA-like
RNAs
(
milRNAs
)
may
be
expressed
in
the
dimorphic
fungus
.

Methodology/Principal
Findings
:
We
attempted
to
identify
milRNAs
in
P.
marneffei
in
both
mycelial
and
yeast
phase
using
high-throughput
sequencing
technology
.

Small
RNAs
were
more
abundantly
expressed
in
mycelial
than
yeast
phase
.

Sequence
analysis
revealed
24
potential
milRNA
candidates
,
including
17
candidates
in
mycelial
and
seven
in
yeast
phase
.

Two
genes
,
dcl-1
and
dcl-2
,
encoding
putative
Dicer-like
proteins
and
the
gene
,
qde-2
,
encoding
Argonaute-like
protein
,
were
identified
in
P.
marneffei
.

Phylogenetic
analysis
showed
that
dcl-2
of
P.
marneffei
was
more
closely
related
to
the
homologues
in
other
thermal
dimorphic
pathogenic
fungi
than
to
Penicillium
chrysogenum
and
Aspergillus
spp.
,
suggesting
the
co-evolution
of
dcl-2
among
the
thermal
dimorphic
fungi
.

Moreover
,
dcl-2
demonstrated
higher
mRNA
expression
levels
in
mycelial
than
yeast
phase
by
7
folds
(
P,0.001
)
.

Northern
blot
analysis
confirmed
the
expression
of
two
milRNAs
,
PM-milR-M1
and
PM-milR-M2
,
only
in
mycelial
phase
.

Using
dcl-1
KO
,
dcl-2
KO
,
dcl
DKO
and
qde-2
KO
deletion
mutants
,
we
showed
that
the
biogenesis
of
both
milRNAs
were
dependent
on
dcl-2
but
not
dcl-1
or
qde-2
.

The
mRNA
expression
levels
of
three
predicted
targets
of
PM-milR-M1
were
upregulated
in
knockdown
strain
PM-milR-M1
KD
,
supporting
regulatory
function
of
milRNAs
.

Conclusions/Significance
:
Our
findings
provided
the
first
evidence
for
differential
expression
of
milRNAs
in
different
growth
phases
of
thermal
dimorphic
fungi
and
shed
light
on
the
evolution
of
fungal
proteins
involved
in
milRNA
biogenesis
and
possible
role
of
post-transcriptional
control
in
governing
thermal
dimorphism

The
faecal

plays
a
critical
role

However
,
little
is

one
of
the
most
important
diarrhoeal
diseases

In
this
study
,
alterations

the
faecal
microbiota
of
neonatal
calves
as
a
result
of
Cryptosporidium
parvum
infection

Comparisons
were
made
among
groups
of

parvum-infected
,
rotavirus-infected

and
the
pathogen-negative
calves

A
specific
increase

the
abundance
of
Fusobacterium

observed
in
the
faecal
microbiota
of
C.
parvum-infected
animals
.

Diarrhoea
severity
increased
in
accordance
with
the
abundance
of
C.
parvum
and
Fusobacterium
.

Moreover
,
the
specific
increase
of
Fusobacterium
appeared
to
be
a
universal
feature
of
C.
parvum
infection
,
since
neonatal
calves
from
geographically
separated
areas
showed
the
same
result
.

These
observations
indicated
that
the
growth
of
Fusobacterium
may
be
an
important
aggravating
factor
of
cryptosporidiosis

The
non-structural
protein
13
(
nsp13
)
of
Severe
Acute
Respiratory
Syndrome
Coronavirus
(
SARS-CoV
)
is
a
helicase
that
separates
double-stranded
RNA
(
dsRNA
)
or
DNA
(
dsDNA
)
with
a
59R39
polarity
,
using
the
energy
of
nucleotide
hydrolysis
.

We
determined
the
minimal
mechanism
of
helicase
function
by
nsp13
.

We
showed
a
clear
unwinding
lag
with
increasing
length
of
the
double-stranded
region
of
the
nucleic
acid
,
suggesting
the
presence
of
intermediates
in
the
unwinding
process
.

To
elucidate
the
nature
of
the
intermediates
we
carried
out
transient
kinetic
analysis
of
the
nsp13
helicase
activity
.

We
demonstrated
that
the
enzyme
unwinds
nucleic
acid
in
discrete
steps
of
9.3
base-pairs
(
bp
)
each
,
with
a
catalytic
rate
of
30
steps
per
second
.

Therefore
the
net
unwinding
rate
is
,280
base-pairs
per
second
.

We
also
showed
that
nsp12
,
the
SARS-CoV
RNA-dependent
RNA
polymerase
(
RdRp
)
,
enhances
(
2-fold
)
the
catalytic
efficiency
of
nsp13
by
increasing
the
step
size
of
nucleic
acid
(
RNA/RNA
or
DNA/DNA
)
unwinding
.

This
effect
is
specific
for
SARS-CoV
nsp12
,
as
no
change
in
nsp13
activity
was
observed
when
foot-and-mouth-disease
virus
RdRp
was
used
in
place
of
nsp12
.

Our
data
provide
experimental
evidence
that
nsp13
and
nsp12
can
function
in
a
concerted
manner
to
improve
the
efficiency
of
viral
replication
and
enhance
our
understanding
of
nsp13
function
during
SARS-CoV
RNA
synthesis
.

Background
:
Non-pharmaceutical
interventions
(
NPI
)
are
the
first
line
of
defense
against
pandemic
influenza
.

These
interventions
dampen
virus
spread
by
reducing
contact
between
infected
and
susceptible
persons
.

Because
they
curtail
essential
societal
activities
,
they
must
be
applied
judiciously
.

Optimal
control
theory
is
an
approach
for
modeling
and
balancing
competing
objectives
such
as
epidemic
spread
and
NPI
cost
.

Methods
:
We
apply
optimal
control
on
an
epidemiologic
compartmental
model
to
develop
triggers
for
NPI
implementation
.

The
objective
is
to
minimize
expected
person-days
lost
from
influenza
related
deaths
and
NPI
implementations
for
the
model
.

We
perform
a
multivariate
sensitivity
analysis
based
on
Latin
Hypercube
Sampling
to
study
the
effects
of
input
parameters
on
the
optimal
control
policy
.

Additional
studies
investigated
the
effects
of
departures
from
the
modeling
assumptions
,
including
exponential
terminal
time
and
linear
NPI
implementation
cost
.

Results
:
An
optimal
policy
is
derived
for
the
control
model
using
a
linear
NPI
implementation
cost
.

Linear
cost
leads
to
a
``
bang-bang
''
policy
in
which
NPIs
are
applied
at
maximum
strength
when
certain
state
criteria
are
met
.

Multivariate
sensitivity
analyses
are
presented
which
indicate
that
NPI
cost
,
death
rate
,
and
recovery
rate
are
influential
in
determining
the
policy
structure
.

Further
death
rate
,
basic
reproductive
number
and
recovery
rate
are
the
most
influential
in
determining
the
expected
cumulative
death
.

When
applying
the
NPI
policy
,
the
cumulative
deaths
under
exponential
and
gamma
terminal
times
are
close
,
which
implies
that
the
outcome
of
applying
the
``
bang-bang
''
policy
is
insensitive
to
the
exponential
assumption
.

Quadratic
cost
leads
to
a
multi-level
policy
in
which
NPIs
are
applied
at
varying
strength
levels
,
again
based
on
certain
state
criteria
.

Results
indicate
that
linear
cost
leads
to
more
costly
implementation
resulting
in
fewer
deaths
.

Conclusions
:
The
application
of
optimal
control
theory
can
provide
valuable
insight
to
developing
effective
control
strategies
for
pandemic
.

Our
findings
highlight
the
importance
of
establishing
a
sensitive
and
timely
surveillance
system
for
pandemic
preparedness
.

Coronaviruses
(
CoVs
)
are
a
large
family
of
enveloped
,
positivestrand
RNA
viruses
.

Four
human
CoVs
(
HCoVs
)
,
the
non-severe
acute
respiratory
syndrome
(
SARS
)
-like
HCoVs
(
namely
HCoV
229E
,
NL63
,
OC43
,
and
HKU1
)
,
are
globally
endemic
and
account
for
a
substantial
fraction
of
upper
respiratory
tract
infections
.

Non-SARS-like
CoV
can
occasionally
produce
severe
diseases
in
frail
subjects
but
do
not
cause
any
major
(
fatal
)
epidemics
.

In
contrast
,
SARS
like
CoVs
(
namely
SARS-CoV
and
Middle-East
respiratory
syndrome
coronavirus
,
MERS-CoV
)
can
cause
intense
short-lived
fatal
outbreaks
.

The
current
epidemic
caused
by
the
highly
contagious
SARS-CoV-2
and
its
rapid
spread
globally
is
of
major
concern
.

There
is
scanty
knowledge
on
the
actual
pandemic
potential
of
this
new
SARS-like
virus
.

It
might
be
speculated
that
SARS-CoV-2
epidemic
is
grossly
underdiagnosed
and
that
the
infection
is
silently
spreading
across
the
globe
with
two
consequences
:
(
i
)
clusters
of
severe
infections
among
frail
subjects
could
haphazardly
occur
linked
to
unrecognized
index
cases
;
(
ii
)
the
current
epidemic
could
naturally
fall
into
a
low-level
endemic
phase
when
a
significant
number
of
subjects
will
have
developed
immunity
.

Understanding
the
role
of
paucisymptomatic
subjects
and
stratifying
patients
according
to
the
risk
of
developing
severe
clinical
presentations
is
pivotal
for
implementing
reasonable
measures
to
contain
the
infection
and
to
reduce
its
mortality
.

Whilst
the
future
evolution
of
this
epidemic
remains
unpredictable
,
classic
public
health
strategies
must
follow
rational
patterns
.

The
emergence
of
yet
another
global
epidemic
underscores
the
permanent
challenges
that
infectious
diseases
pose
and
underscores
the
need
for
global
cooperation
and
preparedness
,
even
during
inter-epidemic
periods
.

was
observed
as
a
key

of
numerous

The
origin
and
evolution
of
viruses
is
a
subject
of
ongoing
debate
.

In
this
study
,
we
provide
a
full
account
of
the
evolutionary
relationships
between
proteins
of
significant
sequence
and
structural
similarity
found
in
viruses
that
belong
to
different
classes
according
to
the
Baltimore
classification
.

We
show
that
such
proteins
can
be
found
in
viruses
from
all
Baltimore
classes
.

To
transfer
the
viral
genome
into
the
host
cell
cytoplasm
,
internalized
influenza
A
virus
(
IAV
)
particles
depend
on
the
fusion
of
the
IAV
envelope
with
host
endosomal
membranes
.

The
antiviral
host
interferon
(
IFN
)
response
includes
the
upregulation
of
interferon-induced
transmembrane
protein
3
(
IFITM3
)
,
which
inhibits
the
release
of
the
viral
content
into
the
cytosol
.

Although
IFITM3
induction
occurs
concomitantly
with
late
endosomal/lysosomal
(
LE/L
)
cholesterol
accumulation
,
the
functional
significance
of
this
process
is
not
well
understood
.

Here
we
report
that
LE/L
cholesterol
accumulation
itself
plays
a
pivotal
role
in
the
early
antiviral
defense
.

We
demonstrate
that
inducing
LE/L
cholesterol
accumulation
is
antiviral
in
non-IFN-primed
cells
,
restricting
incoming
IAV
particles
and
impairing
mixing
of
IAV/
endosomal
membrane
lipids
.

Our
results
establish
a
protective
function
of
LE/L
cholesterol
accumulation
and
suggest
endosomal
cholesterol
balance
as
a
possible
antiviral
target
.

IMPORTANCE
With
annual
epidemics
occurring
in
all
parts
of
the
world
and
the
risk
of
global
outbreaks
,
influenza
A
virus
(
IAV
)
infections
remain
a
major
threat
to
public
health
.

Infected
host
cells
detect
viral
components
and
mount
an
interferon
(
IFN
)
-mediated
response
to
restrict
virus
propagation
and
spread
of
infection
.

Identification
of
cellular
factors
and
underlying
mechanisms
that
establish
such
an
antiviral
state
can
provide
novel
strategies
for
the
development
of
antiviral
drugs
.

The
contribution
of
LE/L
cholesterol
levels
,
especially
in
the
context
of
the
IFN-induced
antiviral
response
,
has
remained
controversial
so
far
.

Here
,
we
report
that
accumulation
of
cholesterol
in
the
LE/L
compartment
contributes
to
the
IFN-induced
host
cell
defense
against
incoming
IAV
.

Our
results
establish
cholesterol
accumulation
in
LE/L
per
se
as
a
novel
antiviral
barrier
and
suggest
the
endosomal
cholesterol
balance
as
a
putative
druggable
host
cell
factor
in
IAV
infection
.

The
merlin-ERM
(
ezrin
,
radixin
,
moesin
)
family
of
proteins
plays
a
central
role
in
linking
the
cellular
membranes
to
the
cortical
actin
cytoskeleton
.

Merlin
regulates
contact
inhibition
and
is
an
integral
part
of
cell-cell
junctions
,
while
ERM
proteins
,
ezrin
,
radixin
and
moesin
,
assist
in
the
formation
and
maintenance
of
specialized
plasma
membrane
structures
and
membrane
vesicle
structures
.

These
two
protein
families
share
a
common
evolutionary
history
,
having
arisen
and
separated
via
gene
duplication
near
the
origin
of
metazoa
.

During
approximately
0.5
billion
years
of
evolution
,
the
merlin
and
ERM
family
proteins
have
maintained
both
sequence
and
structural
conservation
to
an
extraordinary
level
.

Comparing
crystal
structures
of
merlin-ERM
proteins
and
their
complexes
,
a
picture
emerges
of
the
merlin-ERM
proteins
acting
as
switchable
interaction
hubs
,
assembling
protein
complexes
on
cellular
membranes
and
linking
them
to
the
actin
cytoskeleton
.

Given
the
high
level
of
structural
conservation
between
the
merlin
and
ERM
family
proteins
we
speculate
that
they
may
function
together
.

The
spike
protein
(
S
)
of
SARS
Coronavirus
(
SARS-CoV
)
mediates
entry
of
the
virus
into
target
cells
,
including
receptor
binding
and
membrane
fusion
.

Close
to
or
in
the
viral
membrane
,
the
S
protein
contains
three
distinct
motifs
:
a
juxtamembrane
aromatic
part
,
a
central
highly
hydrophobic
stretch
and
a
cysteine
rich
motif
.

Here
,
we
investigate
the
role
of
aromatic
and
hydrophobic
parts
of
S
in
the
entry
of
SARS
CoV
and
in
cell-cell
fusion
.

This
was
investigated
using
the
previously
described
SARS
pseudotyped
particles
system
(
SARSpp
)
and
by
fluorescence-based
cell-cell
fusion
assays
.

Results
:
Mutagenesis
showed
that
the
aromatic
domain
was
crucial
for
SARSpp
entry
into
cells
,
with
a
likely
role
in
pore
enlargement
.

Conclusions
:
Multiple
infections
should
be
considered
the
most
likely
result
of
faecal
testing
in
cats
,
and
case
management
needs
to
take
this
into
account
.

In
contrast
,
the
relatively
high
percentage
of
cats
negative
for
all
8
enteropathogens
tested
could
indicate
an
innate
resistance
to
infection
.

Alternatively
it
could
indicate
a
lack
of
exposure
to
these
8
enteropathogens
or
the
presence
of
other
enteropathogens
not
assessed
by
this
assay
.

In
previous
studies
,
differences
in
the
amount
of
genomic
and
subgenomic
RNA
produced
by
coronaviruses
with
mutations
in
the
programmed
ribosomal
frameshift
signal
of
ORF1a/b
were
observed
.

It
was
not
clear
if
these
differences
were
due
to
changes
in
genomic
sequence
,
the
protein
sequence
or
the
frequency
of
frameshifting
.

Here
,
viruses
with
synonymous
codon
changes
are
shown
to
produce
different
ratios
of
genomic
and
subgenomic
RNA
.

These
findings
demonstrate
that
the
protein
sequence
is
not
the
primary
cause
of
altered
genomic
and
subgenomic
RNA
production
.

The
synonymous
codon
changes
affect
both
the
structure
of
the
frameshift
signal
and
frameshifting
efficiency
.

Small
differences
in
frameshifting
efficiency
result
in
dramatic
differences
in
genomic
RNA
production
and
TCID

suggesting
that
the
frameshifting
frequency
must
stay
above

a
certain
threshold
for

The
data
suggest
that
either
the
RNA
sequence
or
the
ratio
of
viral
proteins
resulting
from
different
levels
of
frameshifting
affects
viral
replication
.

Coronaviridae
,
along
with
Arteriviridae
and
Roniviridae
,
belong
to
the
order
Nidovirales
.

Viruses
belonging
to
these
families
are
large
positive
strand
RNA
viruses

known
to
infect

Entry
into
a
host
cell
is
usually
mediated
by
an
interaction
between
the
virus

glycoprotein
and
a
cellular
receptor
[

After
entry

the

New

produced
by
a
mechanism
known

discontinuous

Coronavirus
replication
requires
the
production
of
negative-strand
RNA
from
which
positive-strand
RNA
is
produced
.

Viral
proteins
are
produced
from
the
positive-strand
subgenomic
RNAs
and
from
the
positive-strand
full-length
RNA
.

The
two
largest
open
reading
frames
,
ORF1a
and
ORF1a/b
,
are
translated
from
the
full-length

.

These
open
reading
frames
(
ORFs
)
encode
polyproteins
pp1a
and

which
are
cleaved
by
self-encoded
proteases

The
proteins
encoded
in
ORF1a

ORF1a/b
function
as
the
replicase
,
making
subgenomic
RNAs

new
copies
of
the
genomic
RNA
[

.

Production
of
the
pp1ab
polyprotein
requires
the
translating
ribosome
to
change
reading
frame
at
the
frameshift
signal
that
bridges
ORF1a
and
ORF1a/b
.

Like
most
viral
frameshift
signals
,
frameshifting
at
the
coronavirus
signal
leads
to
expression
of
an
RNA-dependent
RNA
polymerase
(
RdRP
)
,
a
protein
essential
for
viral
replication

The
proteins

the

proteases

We
have
previously
suggested
that
the
ratio
of
the
pp1a
and

proteins
might
affect
the
regulation
and
production
of
genomic

The
SARS
coronavirus
frameshift
signal
has
a
seven
nucleotide
'slippery
sequence
'
and
a
stimulatory
pseudoknot
separated
by
a
spacer
region
.

During
programmed
-1
ribosomal
frameshifting
(
-1PRF
)
,
the
tRNAs
positioned
on
the
slippery
site
uncouple
from
the
mRNA
and
reconnect
in
the
new
reading
frame
.

The
second
stem
of
the
stimulatory
pseudoknot
is
formed
by
the
distal
3
'
sequence
base-pairing
with
residues
in
the
loop
region
of
the
first
stem
loop
.

Unlike
other
frameshift-stimulating
pseudoknots
the
SARS
pseudoknot
contains
an
additional
internal
stem
loop
[

The
function
of
this

,
is
unknown
.

We
have
shown
that
alterations
to
the
SARS
coronavirus
frameshift
signal
affect
frameshifting
efficiency
[

]
.

Reduction
in
frameshifting
efficiency
is
expected
to
result
in
decreased
expression
of
the
frameshift
proteins
,
including
the
RdRP
.

Some
mutations
that
reduced

associated
with
a
several-fold
reduction
in
the

of
genomic

Unfortunately
,
the
mutations
employed
in

studies
altered
both
the

Vesicular
stomatitis
virus
(
VSV
)
is
a
zoonotic
,
negative-stranded
RNA
virus
of
the
family
Rhabdoviridae
.

The
nucleoprotein
(
N
)
of
VSV
protects
the
viral
genomic
RNA
and
plays
an
essential
role
in
viral
transcription
and
replication
,
which
makes
the
nucleoprotein
an
ideal
target
of
host
defense
.

However
,
whether
and
how
host
innate/intrinsic
immunity
limits
VSV
infection
by
targeting
the
N
protein
are
unknown
.

In
this
study
,
we
found
that
the
N
protein
of
VSV
(
VSV-N
)
interacted
with
a
ubiquitin
E3
ligase
,
tripartite
motif
protein
41
(
TRIM41
)
.

Overexpression
of
TRIM41
inhibited
VSV
infection
.

Conversely
,
the
depletion
of
TRIM41
increased
host
susceptibility
to
VSV
.

Furthermore
,
the
E3
ligase
defective
mutant
of
TRIM41
failed
to
limit
VSV
infection
,
suggesting
the
requirement
of
the
E3
ligase
activity
of
TRIM41
in
viral
restriction
.

Indeed
,
TRIM41
ubiquitinated
VSV-N
in
cells
and
in
vitro
.

TRIM41-mediated
ubiquitination
leads
to
the
degradation
of
VSV-N
through
proteasome
,
thereby
limiting
VSV
infection
.

Taken
together
,
our
study
identifies
TRIM41
as
a
new
intrinsic
immune
factor
against
VSV
by
targeting
the
viral
nucleoprotein
for
ubiquitination

subsequent
protein
degradation

Planning
for
a
re-emergent
epidemic
of
smallpox
requires
surge
capacity
of
space
,
resources
and
personnel
within
health
systems
.

There
are
many
uncertainties
in
such
a
scenario
,
including
likelihood
and
size
of
an
attack
,
speed
of
response
and
health
system
capacity
.

We
used
a
model
for
smallpox
transmission
to
determine
requirements
for
hospital
beds
,
contact
tracing
and
health
workers
(
HCWs
)
in
Sydney
,
Australia
,
during
a
modelled
epidemic
of
smallpox
.

Sensitivity
analysis
was
done
on
attack
size
,
speed
of
response
and
proportion
of
case
isolation
and
contact
tracing
.

We
estimated
100638
clinical
HCWs
and
14595
public
hospital
beds
in
Sydney
.

Rapid
response
,
case
isolation
and
contact
tracing
are
influential
on
epidemic
size
,
with
case
isolation
more
influential
than
contact
tracing
.

With
95
%
of
cases
isolated
,
outbreak
control
can
be
achieved
within
100
days
even
with
only
50
%
of
contacts
traced
.

However
,
if
case
isolation
and
contact
tracing
both
fall
to
50
%
,
epidemic
control
is
lost
.

With
a
smaller
initial
attack
and
a
response
commencing
20
days
after
the
attack
,
health
system
impacts
are
modest
.

The
requirement
for
hospital
beds
will
vary
from
up
to
4
%
to
100
%
of
all
available
beds
in
best
and
worst
case
scenarios
.

If
the
response
is
delayed
,
or
if
the
attack
infects
10000
people
,
all
available
beds
will
be
exceeded
within
40
days
,
with
corresponding
surge
requirements
for
clinical
health
care
workers
(
HCWs
)
.

We
estimated
there
are
330
public
health
workers
in
Sydney
with
up
to
940,350
contacts
to
be
traced
.

At
least
3
million
respirators
will
be
needed
for
the
first
100
days

To
ensure
adequate
health
system
capacity
,
rapid
response
,
high
rates
of
case
isolation
,
excellent
contact
tracing
and
vaccination
,
and
protection
of
HCWs
should
be
a
priority
.

Surge
capacity
must
be
planned
.

Failures
in
any
of
these
could
cause

The
emergence
of
Middle
East
Respiratory
Syndrome
Coronavirus
(
MERS-CoV
)
,
nearly
a
decade
ago
with
worldwide
distribution
,
was
believed
to
be
of
zoonotic
origin
from
bats
with
dromedary
camels
as
intermediate
hosts
.

There
is
a
likelihood
of
other
domestic
livestock
serving
as
intermediate
hosts
for
this
virus
.

The
presence
of
coronaviruses
,
closely
related
to
MERS-CoV
in
Ghanaian
bats
,
presented
the
opportunity
to
test
the
hypothesis
of
transmissibility
of
this
virus
through
domestic
livestock
species
.

The
possible
interactions
between
livestock
and
bats
in
31
household
farms
were
accessed
by
observation
and
interviews
with
farmers
.

Rectal
swabs
and
serum
from
cattle
,
sheep
,
goats
,
donkeys
,
and

and

antibodies
against
the
target
viruses
were
used

Likely
contact
between
livestock
and
bats
was
determined
for
13
farms
(
41.9
%
)
that
reported
confining
their
livestock
and
also
observing
bats
in
their
homes
.

Livestock
were
left
unconfined
on
eight
farms
(
25.8
%
)
that
also
observed
bats
roosting
in
trees
close
to
their
homes
.

No
viral
RNA
or
antibodies
against
the
two
coronaviruses
were
detected
in
any
of
the
livestock
species
tested
.

Cattle
,
sheep
,
goats
,
donkeys
,
and
swine
are
not

of

89K
is
a
newly
identified
PAI
in
epidemic
Streptococcus
suis
isolates
that
are
related
to
the
two
recent
largescale
outbreaks
of
human
infection
in
China
.

However
,
its
mechanism
of
evolution
and
contribution
to
the
epidemic
spread
of
S.
suis
2
remain
unknown
.

In
this
study
,
the
potential
for
mobilization
of
89K
was
evaluated
,
and
its
putative
transfer
mechanism
was
investigated
.

We
report
that
89K
can
spontaneously
excise
to
form
an
extrachromosomal
circular
product
.

The
precise
excision
is
mediated
by
an
89K-borne
integrase
through
site-specific
recombination
,
with
help
from
an
excisionase
.

The
89K
excision
intermediate
acts
as
a
substrate
for
lateral
transfer
to
non-89K
S.
suis
2
recipients
,
where
it
reintegrates
sitespecifically
into
the
target
site
.

The
conjugal
transfer
of
89K
occurred
via
a
GI
type
IV
secretion
system
(
T4SS
)
encoded
in
89K
,
at
a
frequency
of
10
-6
transconjugants
per
donor
.

This
is
the
first
demonstration
of
horizontal
transfer
of
a
Gram-positive
PAI
mediated
by
a
GI-type
T4SS
.

We
propose
that
these
genetic
events
are
important
in
the
emergence
,
pathogenesis
and
persistence
of
epidemic
S.
suis
2
strains

proved
limited
to

Hence
,
here
we
evaluated
the
efficacy
of
administration
of
a
probiotic
compound
containing
Bacillus
mesentericus
,
Clostridium

)
to
improve
the
health
and
reproductive
performance
of
PED-infected
sows
.

Twenty
pregnant
sows
in
a
PED-positive
farm
were
equally
divided
into
probiotics-administered
(
VP
)
and
control
(
VC
)
sow
groups
.

A
commercial
live-attenuated
vaccine
was
injected
as
per
the
manufacturer
's
instruction
.

The
probiotic
compound
(
15
g/day
)
was
orally
administered
to
VP
from
6
weeks
pre-parturition
to
7
days
post-parturition
(
ppd7
)
.

VP
had
a
significantly
higher
body
weight
at
ppd7
than
VC
(
191
vs
186
kg
;
P
<

)
.

At
day
3
post-parturition
(
ppd3
)
(
4.18
vs
3.63
kg/day
)
and
ppd7
(
5.14
vs
4.34
kg/day
)
,
milk
produced
by
VP
was
significantly
(
P
<
0.05
)
greater
than
that
by
VC
.

Total
immunoglobulin
(
Ig
)
A
and
IgG
concentrations
at
day
0
were
significantly
(
P
<
0.05
)
higher
in
whey
of
VP
(
1.9
and
6.6
g/dL
,
respectively
)
than
in
that
of
VC
(
1.7
and
6.1
g/dL
,
respectively
)
.

However
,
total
IgG
concentration
in
whey
of
VP
and
VC
at
ppd3
and
ppd7
did
not
differ
.

Antibody
titer
was
significantly
higher
at
day
0
in
serum
of
VP
than
it
was
that
of
VC
(
60
vs
37
in
geometric
mean
;
P
<
0.05
)
.

Likewise
,
the
antibody
titer
in
whey
of
VP
and
VC
was
found
to
be
similar
at
day
0
(
416
vs
208
in
geometric
mean
;
P
=
0.13
)
.

Consequently
,
VP
had
fewer
days
between
weaning
and
return
to
estrus
than
did
VC
(
7
vs
10
days
;
P
<
0.05
)
.

Moreover
,
piglets
of
VP
had
a
significantly
(
P
<
0.05
)
higher
litter
weight
at
birth
(
9,252
g/litter
)
and
a
lower
mortality
(
12
%
)
during
suckling
than
those
of
VC
(
8,686
g/litter
and
28
%
,
respectively
)
.

In
summary
,
probiotic-supplemented
,
PEDvaccinated
sows
were
healthier
,
transferred
PED-specific
antibodies
via
colostrum
to
piglets

to
generate
figures
with

correction
.

Results
.

Ten
genes
were
found
to
be
significantly
associated
with
adenocarcinoma
.

Seven
of
these
associations
remained
statistically
significant
after
correction
for
multiple
comparisons
.

Notably
,
AGTR2
,
which
encodes
the
AT
2
angiotensin
II
receptor
subtype
,
was
significantly
underexpressed
in
adenocarcinoma
tissue
(
<
0.01
)
.

AGTR1
,
ACE
,
ENPEP
,
MME
,
and
PRCP
,
which
encode
the
AT
1
angiotensin
II
receptor
,
angiotensin-converting
enzyme
,
aminopeptidase
N
,
neprilysin
,
and
prolylcarboxypeptidase
,
respectively
,
were
also
underexpressed
.

AGT
,
which
encodes
angiotensinogen
,
the
angiotensin
peptide
precursor
,
was
overexpressed
in
adenocarcinoma
tissue
.

Conclusion
.

The
results
suggest
an
association
between
the
expression
of
the
genes
for
renin-angiotensin
system-related
proteins
and
adenocarcinoma
.

While
further
research
is
necessary
to
conclusively
demonstrate
a
link
between
the
renin-angiotensin
system
and
lung
cancers
,
the
results
suggest
that
the
renin-angiotensin
system
plays
a
role
in
the
pathology
of
adenocarcinoma
.

Background
:
Given
that
there
is
a
possibility
of
a
human
H5N1
pandemic
and
the
fact
that
the
recent
H5N1
viruses
are
resistant
to
the
anti-viral
drugs
,
newer
strategies
for
effective
therapy
are
warranted
.

Previous
studies
show
that
single
mAbs
in
immune
prophylaxis
can
be
protective
against
H5N1
infection
.

But
a
single
mAb
may
not
be
effective
in
neutralization
of
a
broad
range
of
different
strains
of
H5N1
and
control
of
potential
neutralization
escape
mutants
.

Methods/Principal
Findings
:
We
selected
two
mAbs
which
recognized
different
epitopes
on
the
hemagglutinin
molecule
.

These
two
mAbs
could
each
neutralize
in
vitro
escape
mutants
to
the
other
and
in
combination
could
effectively
neutralize
viruses
from
clades
0
,
1
,
2.1
,
2.2
,
2.3
,
4
,
7
and
8
of
influenza
A
H5N1
viruses
.

This
combination
of
chimeric
mAbs
when
administered
passively
,
pre
or
post
challenge
with
10
MLD50
(
50
%
mouse
lethal
dose
)
HPAI
H5N1
influenza
A
viruses
could
protect
100
%
of
the
mice
from
two
different
clades
of
viruses
(
clades
1
and
2.1
)
.

We
also
tested
the
efficacy
of
a
single
dose
of
the
combination
of
mAbs
versus
two
doses
.

Two
doses
of
the
combination
therapy
not
only
affected
early
clearance
of
the
virus
from
the
lung
but
could
completely
prevent
lung
pathology
of
the
H5N1
infected
mice
.

No
escape
variants
were
detected
after
therapy
.

Conclusions/Significance
:
Our
studies
provide
proof
of
concept
that
the
synergistic
action
of
two
or
more
mAbs
in
combination
is
required
for
preventing
the
generation
of
escape
mutants
and
also
to
enhance
the
therapeutic
efficacy
of
passive
therapy
against
H5N1
infection
.

Combination
therapy
may
allow
for
a
lower
dose
of
antibody
to
be
administered
for
passive
therapy
of
influenza
infection
and
hence
can
be
made
available
at
reduced
economic
costs
during
an
outbreak
.

Positive-sense
RNA
viruses
hijack
intracellular
membranes
that
provide
niches
for
viral
RNA
synthesis
and
a
platform
for
interactions
with
host
proteins
.

However
,
little
is
known
about
host
factors
at
the
interface
between
replicase
complexes
and
the
host
cytoplasm
.

We
engineered
a
biotin
ligase
into
a
coronaviral
replication/transcription
complex
(
RTC
)
and
identified
>
500
host
proteins
constituting
the
RTC
microenvironment
.

siRNA-silencing
of
each
RTC-proximal
host
factor
demonstrated
importance
of
vesicular
trafficking
pathways
,
ubiquitin-dependent
and
autophagyrelated
processes
,
and
translation
initiation
factors
.

Notably
,
detection
of
translation
initiation
factors
at
the
RTC
was
instrumental
to
visualize
and
demonstrate
active
translation
proximal
to
replication
complexes
of
several
coronaviruses
.

Collectively
,
we
establish
a
spatial
link
between
viral
RNA
synthesis
and
diverse
host
factors
of
unprecedented
breadth
.

Our
data
may
serve
as
a
paradigm
for
other
positive-strand
RNA
viruses
and
provide
a
starting
point
for
a
comprehensive
analysis
of
critical
virus-host
interactions
that
represent
targets
for
therapeutic
intervention
.

Background
:
Host
genetic
factors
may
play
a
role
in
the
occurrence
and
progress
of
SARS-Cov

.

This
study
was
to
investigate
the
relationship
between
tumor
necrosis

(
TNF
)
-α
gene
polymorphisms
with
the
occurrence
of

and
its
role
in
prognosis
of
patients
with
lung

and
femoral

osteonecrosis
.

The
association
between
genetic
polymorphisms
of
TNF-α
gene
and
susceptibility
to
severe
acute
respiratory
syndromes
(
SARS
)
was
conducted
in
a
hospital-based
case-control
study
including
75
SARS
patients
,
41
health
care
workers
and
92
healthy

.

Relationships
of
TNFα
gene
polymorphisms
with
interstitial
lung
fibrosis
and
femoral
head
osteonecrosis
were
carried
out
in
two
case-case
studies
in
discharged
SARS
patients
.

PCR
sequencing
based
typing
(
PCR-SBT
)
method
was
used
to
determine
the
polymorphisms
of
TNF-α
gene
in
locus
of
the
promoter
region
and
univariate
logistic
analysis
was
conducted
in
analyzing
the
collected
data
.

Results
:
Compared
to
TT
genotype
,
the
CT
genotype
at
the
-204
locus
was
found
associated
with
a
protective
effect
on
SARS
with
OR
(
95

CI
)
of
0.95
(
0.90-0.99
)
.

Also
,
TT
genotype
,
CT
and
CC
were
found
associated
with
a
risk
effect
on
femoral

with
ORs
(
95

and
5.67
(
2.74-11.71
)
,
respectively
and
the
glucocorticoid
adjusted
OR
of
CT
was
5.25
(
95

CI
1.18-23.46
)
and
the
combined
(

was
6.0
(
95

CI
1.60-22.55
)
at
-1031
site
of
TNF-α
gene
.

At
the
same
time
,
the
-863
AC
genotype
was
manifested
as
another
risk
effect
associated
with
femoral
head
necrosis
with
OR
(
95
%
CI
)
of
6.42
(

and
the

was
8.40
(
95
%
CI
1.76-40.02
)
in
cured
SARS
patients
compared
to
CC
genotype
.

Conclusion
:
SNPs
of
TNF-α
gene
of
promoter
region
may
not
associate
with
SARS-CoV
infection
.

And
these
SNPs
may
not
affect
interstitial
lung
fibrosis
in
cured
SARS
patients
.

However
,
the
-1031CT/CC
and
-863
AC
genotypes
may
be
risk
factors
of
femoral
head
necrosis
in
discharged
SARS
patients
.

Background
:
Viruses
are
important
triggers
of
asthma
exacerbations
.

They
are
also
detected
outside
of
exacerbation
.

Alteration
of
anti-viral
response
in
asthmatic
patients
has
been
shown
although
the
mechanisms
responsible
for
this
defect
remain
unclear
.

The
objective
of
this
study
was
to
compare
in
virus-infected
and
not-infected
allergic
asthmatic
children
,
aged
6
to
16
years
,
admitted
to
hospital
for
a
severe
exacerbation
,
the
innate
immune
response
and
especially
the
expression
of
pattern
recognition
receptor
(
PRR
)
and
their
function
.

Methods
:
Virus
identification
was
performed
both
during
the
exacerbation
and
at
steady
state
(
eight
weeks
later
)
.

Data
assessed
at
both
periods
included
clinical
features
,
anti-viral
response
and
inflammation
(
in
sputum
and
plasma
)
,
and
PRR
expression/function
in
blood
mononuclear
cells
.

Results
:
Viruses
were
identified
in
46
out
of
72
children
(
median
age
8.9
years
)
during
exacerbation
,
and
among
them
,
in
17
at
steady
state
.

IFN-β
,
IFN-γ
and
IL-29
levels
in
sputum
and
plasma
were
similar
between
infected
and
not
infected
patients
at
both
times
,
as
well
as
the
expression
of
TLR3
,
RIG-I
and
MDA5
in
blood
monocytes
and
dendritic
cells
.

Airway
inflammation
in
infected
patients
was
characterized
by
significantly
higher
IL-5
concentration
and
eosinophil
count
.

Compared
to
patients
only
infected
at
exacerbation
,
the
re-infected
children
significantly
exhibited
lower
levels
of
IFN-γ
in
plasma
and
sputum
at
exacerbation
associated
with
modifications
in
PRR
expression
and
function
in
blood
mononuclear
cells
.

These
re-infected
patients
also
presented
an
airway
neutrophilic
inflammation
at
steady
state
.

Conclusion
:
Our
results
reports
in
asthmatic
children
that
impaired
anti-viral
response
during
virus-induced
exacerbation
is
more
pronounced
in
a
subgroup
of
patients
prone
to
re-infection
by
virus
.

This
subgroup
is
characterized
by
altered
PRR
function
and
a
different
pattern
of
airway
inflammation
.

Trial

:
This
multicenter
prospective
study
was
approved
by
the
regional
investigational
review
board
(
ref
:
08/07
)
.

infections
have
reignited
interest
in
antibody-based
therapeutics
.

Since
the
production
process
for
monoclonal
antibodies
can
be
prolonged
and
costly
,
alternative
treatments
should
be
investigated
.

We
produced
purified
equine
antisera
from
horses
hyperimmunized
with
EBOV
virus-like
particles
,
and
tested
the
post-exposure
efficacy
of
the
antisera
in
a
mouse
model
of
infection
.

BALB/c
mice
were
given
up
to
2
mg
of
purified
equine
antisera
per
animal
,
at
30
minutes
,
1
or
2
days
post-infection
(
dpi
)
,
in
which
all
animals
survived
.

To
decrease
the
possibility
of
serum
sickness
,
the
equine
antisera
was
digested
with
pepsin
to
generate
F
(
ab′
)
2
fragments
,
with
in
vitro
neutralizing
activity
comparable
to
whole
immunoglobulin
.

Full
protection
was
achieved
with
when
treatment
was
initiated
at
1
dpi
,
but
the
suboptimal
protection
observed
with
the
30
minute
and
2
dpi
groups
demonstrate
that
in
addition
to
virus
neutralization
,
other
Fc-dependent
antibody
mechanisms
may
also
contribute
to
survival
.

Guinea
pigs
given
20
mg
of
antisera
or
F
(
ab′
)
2
at
or
starting
at
1
or
2
dpi
were
also
fully
protected
from
EBOV
infection
.

These
results
justify
future
efficacy
studies
for
purified
equine
products
in
NHPs
.

Ebola
virus
(
EBOV
)
is
a
pathogen
from
the
Filoviridae
family
,
and
is
capable
of
causing
severe
hemorrhagic
fever
in
humans
and
non-human
primates
.

Past
outbreaks
of
EBOV
disease
(
EVD
)
were
sporadic
,
unpredictable
and
localized
to
remote
regions
of
central
Africa
,
with
the
death
toll
reaching
up
to
90
%
1
.

EBOV
is
one
of
the
most
lethal
viruses
known
to
humans
and
a
licensed
prophylactic
or
therapeutic
still
remains
unavailable
.

In
a
clinical
setting
,
there
is
currently
little
that
can
be
done
for
infected
patients
outside
of
supportive
care
,
which
includes
fluid
replenishment
,
administration
of
antivirals
,
and
management
of
secondary
symptoms

.

The
combination

The
genus
Torovirus
(
subfamily
Torovirinae
,
family
Coronaviridae
,
order
Nidovirales
)
encompasses
a
range
of
species
that
infect
domestic
ungulates
,
including
cattle
,
sheep
,
goats
,
pigs
,
and
horses
,
causing
an
acute
self-limiting
gastroenteritis
.

Using
the
prototype
species
equine
torovirus
(
EToV
)
,
we
performed
parallel
RNA
sequencing
(
RNA-seq
)
and
ribosome
profiling
(
Ribo-seq
)
to
analyze
the
relative
expression
levels
of
the
known
torovirus
proteins
and
transcripts
,
chimeric
sequences
produced
via
discontinuous
RNA
synthesis
(
a
characteristic
of
the
nidovirus
replication
cycle
)
,
and
changes
in
host
transcription
and
translation
as
a
result
of
EToV
infection
.

RNA
sequencing
confirmed
that
EToV
utilizes
a
unique
combination
of
discontinuous
and
nondiscontinuous
RNA
synthesis
to
produce
its
subgenomic
RNAs
(
sgRNAs
)
;
indeed
,
we
identified
transcripts
arising
from
both
mechanisms
that
would
result
in
sgRNAs
encoding
the
nucleocapsid
.

Our
ribosome
profiling
analysis
revealed
that
ribosomes
efficiently
translate
two
novel
CUG-initiated
open
reading
frames
(
ORFs
)
,
located
within
the
so-called
5=
untranslated
region
.

We
have
termed
the
resulting
proteins
U1
and
U2
.

Comparative
genomic
analysis
confirmed
that
these
ORFs
are
conserved
across
all
available
torovirus
sequences
,
and
the
inferred
amino
acid
sequences
are
subject
to
purifying
selection
,
indicating
that
U1
and
U2
are
functionally
relevant
.

This
study
provides
the
first
high-resolution
analysis
of
transcription
and
translation
in
this
neglected
group
of
livestock
pathogens
.

,
goats
,
pigs
,
and
horses
worldwide
and
can
cause
gastrointestinal
disease
.

There
is
no
treatment
or
vaccine
,
and
their
ability
to
spill
over
into
humans
has
not
been
assessed
.

These
viruses
are
related
to
important
human
pathogens
,
including
severe
acute
respiratory
syndrome
(
SARS
)
coronavirus
,
and
they
share
some
common
features
;
however
,
the
mechanism
that
they
use
to
produce
sgRNA
molecules
differs
.

Here
,
we
performed
deep
sequencing
to
determine
how
equine
torovirus
produces
sgRNAs
.

In
doing
so
,
we
also
identified
two
previously
unknown
open
reading
frames
``
hidden
''
within
the
genome
.

Together
these
results
highlight
the
similarities
and
differences
between
this
domestic
animal
virus
and
related
pathogens
of
humans
and
livestock
.

T
he
order
Nidovirales
currently
contains
four
families
of
positive-sense
,
singlestranded
RNA
viruses
:
the
Coronaviridae
,
Arteriviridae
,
Roniviridae
,
and
Mesoniviridae
(

)
.

Their
grouping
into
the
one
taxonomic
order
is
based
upon
replicase
protein
conservation
,
genome
organization
,
and
replication
strategy
.

However
,
these
viral
families
are
nonetheless
very
diverse
with
respect
to
their
virion
structure
,
host
range
,
pathogenic
potential
,
and
genome
size
.

We
conducted
tandem
RNA-seq
and
Ribo-seq
of
EToV-infected

cells
.

Two

The
aim
of
this
review
was
to
record
systematically
and
assess
the
published
literature
relating
to
the
occupational
risk
of
influenza
A
(
H1N1
)
infection
among
healthcare
personnel
during
the
2009
pandemic
.

The
literature
search
was
performed
in
June
2015
.

An
update
was
carried
out
in
May
2016
.

It
was
applied
to
the
electronic
databases
EMBASE
,
MEDLINE
,
PsycINFO
,
PubMed
,
CINAHL
and
Google

.

The
quality
assessment
was
conducted
with
a
tool
using
eight
criteria
.

A
meta-analysis
was
carried
out
to
compute
pooled
effect
estimates
for
influenza
A
(
H1N1
)
infection
.

A
total
of
26
studies
were
included
in
the
review
,
15
studies
met
the
criteria
for
the
metaanalysis
.

After
a
sensitivity
analysis
the
pooled
analysis
showed
a
significantly
increased
odds
for
influenza
A
(
H1N1
)
infection
for
healthcare
personnel
compared
to
controls/comparisons
(
OR
=
2.08
,
95
%
CI
=
1.73
to
2.51
)
.

The
pooled
prevalence
rate
for
healthcare
personnel
alone
was
6.3
%
.

This
review
corroborates
the
assumption
that
healthcare
personnel
were
particularly
at
risk
of
influenza
A
(
H1N1
)
infection
during
the
2009
pandemic
.

Healthcare
facilities
should
intensify
their
focus
on
strategies
to
prevent
infections
among
healthcare
personnel
,
especially
during
the
first
period
of
pandemics
.

Kaposi
's
sarcoma-associated
herpesvirus
(
KSHV
)
is
an
oncogenic
herpesvirus
associated
with
various
AIDS-related
malignancies
.

Like
other
herpesviruses
,
multiple
processes
required
for
KSHV
lytic
replication
,
including
viral
transcription
,
viral
DNA
synthesis
and
capsid
assembly
occur
in
virus-induced
intranuclear
structures
,
termed
replication
and
transcription
compartments
(
RTCs
)
.

Here
we
utilised
a
novel
methodology
,
combining
subcellular
fractionation
and
quantitative
proteomics
,
to
identify
cellular
proteins
which
are
recruited
to
KSHV-induced
RTCs
and
thus
play
a
key
role
in
KSHV
lytic
replication
.

We
show
that
several
isoforms
of
the
HSP70
chaperone
family
,
Hsc70
and
iHsp70
,
are
redistributed
from
the
cytoplasm
into
the
nucleus
coinciding
with
the
initial
formation
of
KSHV-induced
RTCs
.

We
demonstrate
that
nuclear
chaperone
foci
are
dynamic
,
initially
forming
adjacent
to
newly
formed
KSHV
RTCs
,
however
during
later
time
points
the
chaperones
move
within
KSHV
RTCs
and
completely
co-localise
with
actively
replicating
viral
DNA
.

The
functional
significance
of
Hsp70
isoforms
recruitment
into
KSHV
RTCs
was
also
examined
using
the
specific
Hsp70
isoform
small
molecule
inhibitor
,
VER-155008
.

Intriguingly
,
results
highlight
an
essential
role
of
Hsp70
isoforms
in
the
KSHV
replication
cycle
independent
of
protein
stability
and
maturation
.

Notably
,
inhibition
of
Hsp70
isoforms
precluded
KSHV
RTC
formation
and
RNA
polymerase
II
(
RNAPII
)
relocalisation
to
the
viral
genome
leading
to
the
abolishment
of
global
KSHV
transcription
and
subsequent
viral
protein
synthesis
and
DNA
replication
.

These
new
findings
have
revealed
novel
mechanisms
that
regulate
KSHV
lytic
replication
and
highlight
the
potential
of
HSP70
inhibitors
as
novel
antiviral
agents
.

Molecular
chaperones
from
the
HSP70
and
HSP90
families
have
important
roles
in
cell
survival
.

Recent
evidence
has
also
implicated
their
functioning
in
a
variety
of
diseases
,
including
cancer
.

As
such
they
have
been
identified
as
emerging
drug
targets

While

,
there
is
a
requirement
for
novel
vaccine
strategies
due
to
high

One
key
area

in
the
positive

RNA
virus
field
,
due
to
its

to
gain
insight
into
the
role
of
the

sequences
(

)
in
the
regulation
of
gene
expression

of
porcine

virus
(

)
gene
,
under
the
control
of
the

,
was
inserted
between
the
N
gene
and
3′-UTR
of
the

EGFP
expression
was
analyzed
for

of
all
the

positively
modulated

analyzed
,
those

highly
enhanced

These

indicated
that

Background
:
The
relationships
between
human
population
movement
(
HPM
)
and
health
are
a
concern
at
global
level
.

In
the
case
of
malaria
,
those
links
are
crucial
in
relation
to
the
spread
of
drug
resistant
parasites
and
to
the
elimination
of
malaria
in
the
Greater
Mekong
sub-Region
(
GMS
)
and
beyond
.

The
mobile
and
migrant
populations
(
MMP
)
who
are
involved
in
forest
related
activities
are
both
at
high
risk
of
being
infected
with
malaria
and
at
risk
of
receiving
late
and
sub-standard
treatment
due
to
poor
access
to
health
services
.

In
Cambodia
,
in
2012
,
the
National
Malaria
Control
Programme
(
NMCP
)
identified
,
as
a
key
objective
,
the
development
of
a
specific
strategy
for
MMPs
in
order
to
address
these
challenges
.

A
population
movement
framework
(
PMF
)
for
malaria
was
developed
and
operationalized
in
order
to
contribute
to
this
strategy
.

A
review
of
the
published
and
unpublished
literature
was
conducted
.

Based
on
a
synthesis
of
the
results
,
information
was
presented
and
discussed
with
experienced
researchers
and
programme
managers
in
the
Cambodian
NMCP
and
led
to
the
development
and
refinement
of
a
PMF
for
malaria
.

The
framework
was
``
tested
''
for
face
and
content
validity
with
national
experts
through
a
workshop
approach
.

Results
:
In
the
literature
,
HPM
has
been
described
using
various
spatial
and
temporal
dimensions
both
in
the
context
of
the
spread
of
anti-malarial
drug
resistance
,
and
in
the
context
of
malaria
elimination
and
previous
classifications
have
categorized
MMPs
in
Cambodia
and
the
GMS
through
using
a
number
of
different
criteria
.

Building
on
these
previous
models
,
the
PMF
was
developed
and
then
refined
and
populated
with
in-depth
information
relevant
to
Cambodia
collected
from
social
science
research
and
field
experiences
in
Cambodia
.

The
framework
comprises
of
the
PMF
itself
,
MMP
activity
profiles
and
a
Malaria
Risk
Index
which
is
a
summation
of
three
related
indices
:
a
vulnerability
index
,
an
exposure
index
and
an
access
index
which
allow
a
qualitative
ranking
of
malaria
risk
in
the
MMP
population
.

Application
of
currently
available
data
to
the
framework
illustrates
that
the
highest
risk
population
are
those
highly
mobile
populations
engaged
in
forest
work
.

Conclusion
:
This
paper
describes
the
process
of
defining
MMPs
in
Cambodia
,
identifying
the
different
activities
and
related
risks
to
appropriately
target
and
tailor
interventions
to
the
highest
risk
groups
.

The
framework
has
been
used
to
develop
more
targeted
behaviour
change
and
outreach
interventions
for
MMPs
in
Cambodia
and
its
utility
and
effectiveness
will
be
evaluated
as
part
of
those
interventions
.

.

Despite
the
nuisances
they
induce
and
their
potential
role
as
a
zoonotic
reservoir
,
knowledge
on
urban
rat
populations
remains
scarce
.

The
main
purpose
of
this
study
was
to
characterize
an
urban
brown
rat
population
from
Chanteraines
park
(
Hauts-de-Seine
,
France
)
,
with
regards
to
haematology
,
population
genetics
,
immunogenic
diversity
,
resistance
to
anticoagulant
rodenticides
,
and
community
of
parasites
.

Haematological
parameters
were
measured
.

Population
genetics
was
investigated
using
13
unlinked
microsatellite
loci
.

Immunogenic
diversity
was
assessed
for
Mhc-Drb
.

Frequency
of
the
Y139F
mutation
(
conferring
resistance
to
rodenticides
)
and
two
linked
microsatellites
were
studied
,
concurrently
with
the
presence
of
anticoagulant
residues
in
the
liver
.

Combination
of
microscopy
and
molecular
methods
were
used

.

to
investigate
the
occurrence
of
25
parasites
.

Statistical
approaches
were
used
to
explore
multiple
parasite
relationships
and
model
parasite
occurrence
.

Eighty-six
rats
were
caught
.

The
first
haematological
data
for
a
wild
urban
R.
norvegicus
population
was
reported
.

Genetic
results
suggested
high
genetic
diversity
and
connectivity
between
Chanteraines
rats
and
surrounding
population
(
s
)
.

We
found
a
high
prevalence
(
55.8
%
)
of
the
mutation
Y139F
and
presence
of
rodenticide
residues
in
47.7
%
of
the
sampled
individuals
.

The
parasite
species
richness
was
high
(
16
)
.

Seven
potential
zoonotic
pathogens
were
identified
,
together
with
a
surprisingly
high
diversity
of
Leptospira
species
(
4
)
.

Chanteraines
rat
population
is
not
closed
,
allowing
gene
flow
and
making
eradication
programs
challenging
,
particularly
because
rodenticide
resistance
is
highly
prevalent
.

Parasitological
results
showed
that
co-infection
is
more
a
rule
than
an
exception
.

Furthermore
,
the
presence
of
several
potential
zoonotic
pathogens
,
of
which
four
Leptospira
species
,
in
this
urban
rat
population
raised
its
role
in
the
maintenance
and
spread
of
these
pathogens
.

Our
findings
should
stimulate
future
discussions
about
the
development
of
a
long-term
rat-control
management
program
in
Chanteraines
urban
park

Background
:
Hypoxia
affects
myocardial
oxygen
supply
resulting
in
subclinical
cardiac
dysfunction
in
obstructive
sleep
apnea
(
OSA
)
patients
,
with
cardiovascular
complications
being
associated
with
increased
oxidative
burst
(
OB
)
.

The
aims
of
our
study
were
to
assess
left
ventricular
(
LV
)
dynamic
myocardial
deformation
and
diastolic
reserve
at
rest
and
upon
exercise
,
along
with
OB
determination
in
this
patients
subset
.

Methods
:
Conventional
echocardiography
,
Doppler
myocardial
imaging
and
LV
2D
speckle
tracking
echocardiography
were
performed
in
55
OSA
patients
with
preserved
LV
ejection
fraction
(
EF
)
and
35
age
and
sex-comparable
healthy
controls
.

Peripheral
OB
levels
were
evaluated
by
flow
cytometry
.

Results
:
Despite
comparable
LVEF
,
LV
global
longitudinal
strain
(
GLS
)
was
significantly
reduced
in
OSA
at
rest
(
−
13.4
±
3.8
vs
−
18.4
±

and
at
peak

.

Systolic
pulmonary
artery
pressure
(

and
E/E′
ratios

during
effort
were
higher
in

,
respectively
)
.

The
best
correlate
of
E/E′
at
peak
stress
was
peak
exertion
capacity
(
r
=
−
0.50
,
P
<
0.001
)
.

OB
was
also
increased
in
OSA
patients
(
P
=
0.001
)
but
,
unlike
OSA
severity
,
was
not
associated
with
LV
diastolic
dysfunction
.

Conclusions
:
Evaluation
of
diastolic
function
and
myocardial
deformation
during
exercise
is
feasible
through
stress
echocardiography
.

OSA
patients
with
preserved
LVEF
show
subclinical
LV
systolic
dysfunction
,
impaired
LV
systolic
and
diastolic
reserve
,
reduced
exercise
tolerance
,
and
increased
peripheral
levels
of
OB
.

Therapy
aimed
at
increasing
LV
diastolic
function
reserve
might
improve
the
quality
of
life
and
exercise
tolerability
in
OSA
patients

replication
,
intrinsic
and
extrinsic
factors
that
contribute
to
disease
outbreaks
,
and
the
role
of
the
host
immune
system
in
protection
from
disease
.

Chronic
infections
represent
a
continuous
battle
between
the
host
's
immune
system
and
pathogen
replication
.

Many
protozoan
parasites
have
evolved
a
cyst
lifecycle
stage
that
provides
it
with
increased
protection
from
environmental
degradation
as
well
as
endogenous
host
mechanisms
of
attack
.

In
the
case
of
Toxoplasma
gondii
,
these
cysts
are
predominantly
found
in
the
immune
protected
brain
making
clearance
of
the
parasite
more
difficult
and
resulting
in
a
lifelong
infection
.

Currently
,
little
is
known
about
the
nature
of
the
immune
response
stimulated
by
the
presence
of
these
cysts
or
how
they
are
able
to
propagate
.

Here
we
establish
a
novel
chitinase-dependent
mechanism
of
cyst
control
in
the
infected
brain
.

Despite
a
dominant
Th1
immune
response
during
Toxoplasma
infection
there
exists
a
population
of
alternatively
activated
macrophages
(
AAMØ
)
in
the
infected
CNS
.

These
cells
are
capable
of
cyst
lysis
via
the
production
of
AMCase
as
revealed
by
live
imaging
,
and
this
chitinase
is
necessary
for
protective
immunity
within
the
CNS
.

These
data
demonstrate
chitinase
activity
in
the
brain
in
response
to
a
protozoan
pathogen
and
provide
a
novel
mechanism
to
facilitate
cyst
clearance
during
chronic
infections
.

Neonatal
sepsis
is
a
disease
process
,
which
represents
the
systemic
response
of
bacteria
entering
the
bloodstream
during
the
first
28
days
of
life
.

The
prevalence
of
sepsis
is
higher
in
male
infants
than
in
females
,
but
the
exact
cause
is
unknown
.

Glucose-6-phosphate
dehydrogenase
(
G6PD
)
is
an
enzyme
in
the
pentose
phosphate
pathway
,
which
leads
to
the
production
of
NADPH
.

NADPH
is
required
for
the
respiratory
burst
reaction
in
white
blood
cells
(
WBCs
)
to
destroy
microorganisms
.

The
purpose
of
this
study
was
to
evaluate
the
prevalence
of
G6PD
deficiency
in
neonates
with
sepsis
.

Materials
and
methods
.

This
study
was
performed
on
76
neonates
with
sepsis
and
1214
normal
neonates
from
February
2012
to
November
2014
in
the
west
of
Iran
.

The
G6PD
deficiency
status
was
determined
by
fluorescent
spot
test
.

WBCs
number
and
neutrophils
percentages
were
measured
and
compared
in
patients
with
and
without
G6PD
deficiency
.

Results
.

The
prevalence
of
the
G6PD
deficiency
in
neonates
with
sepsis
was
significantly
higher
compared
to
the
control
group
(
p=0.03
)
.

WBCs
number
and
neutrophils
percentages
in
G6PD
deficient
patients
compared
with
patients
without
G6PD
deficiency
were
decreased
,
but
were
not
statistically
significant
(
p=0.77
and
p=0.86
respectively
)
.

Conclusions
.

G6PD
deficiency
is
a
risk
factor
of
neonatal
sepsis
and
also
a
justification
for
more
male
involvement
in
this
disease
.

Therefore
,
newborn
screening
for
this
disorder
is
recommended
.

Bats
are
known
to
harbor
multiple
paramyxoviruses
.

Despite
the
creation
of
two
new
genera
,
Aquaparamyxovirus
and
Ferlavirus
,
to
accommodate
this
increasing
diversity
,
several
recently
isolated
or
characterized
viruses
remain
unclassified
beyond
the
subfamily
level
.

In
the
present
study
,
among
985
bats
belonging
to
6
species
sampled
in
the
Belinga
caves
of
Gabon
,
RNA
of
an
unclassified
paramyxovirus
(
Belinga
bat
virus
,
BelPV
)
was
discovered
in
14
African
sheathtailed
bats
(
Coleura
afra
)
,
one
of
which
exhibited
several
hemorrhagic
lesions
at
necropsy
,
and
viral
sequence
was
obtained
in
two
animals
.

Phylogenetically
,
BelPV
is
related
to
J
virus
and
Beilong
virus
(
BeiPV
)
,
two
other
unclassified
paramyxoviruses
isolated
from
rodents
.

In
the
diseased
BelPV-infected
C.
afra
individual
,
high
viral
load
was
detected
in
the
heart
,
and
the

Human
respiratory

(
RSV
)
is
one
of
the
most
common
viruses
infecting
the
respiratory

of
infants
.

The
rapid
and
sensitive
detection
of
RSV
is
important
to
minimize
the
incidence
of
infection
.

In
this

,
novel
monoclonal
antibodies
(
mAbs
;
B11A5

were
developed
and
applied
to
develop
a

(
FICT
)
,
employing
europium

as
the

.

For
the
FICT
,
the

ChaC
glutathione-specific
γglutamylcyclotransferase
1
(
CHAC1
)
mRNA
is
differentially
expressed
in
primary
human
airway
epithelial
cells
from
bronchi
(
hAECBs
)
from
patients
with
CF
and
healthy
patients
at
baseline
and
upon
infection
with
Pa.
CHAC1
degrades
glutathione
and
is
associated
with
ER
stress
and
apoptosis
pathways
.

In
this
study
,
we
examined
the
roles
of
CHAC1
in
the
inflammatory
response
and
apoptosis
in
lung
epithelial
cells
.

First
,
we
confirmed
by
reverse
transcription
quantitative
polymerase
chain
reaction
that
CHAC1
mRNA
was
overexpressed
in
hAECBs
from
patients
without
CF
compared
with
the
expression
in
hAECBs
from
patients
with
CF
upon
Pa
(
PAK
strain
)
infection
.

Moreover
,
the
Pa
virulence
factors
LPS
and
flagellin
were
shown
to
induce
CHAC1
expression
in
cells
from
patients
without
CF
.

Using
NCI-H292
lung
epithelial
cells
,
we
found
that
LPS-induced
CHAC1
mRNA
expression
was
PERK-independent
and
involved
ATF4
.

Additionally
,
using
CHAC1
small
interfering
RNA
,
we
showed
that
reduced
CHAC1
expression
in
the
context
of
LPS
and
flagellin
stimulation
was
associated
with
modulation
of
inflammatory
markers
and
alteration
of
NF-κB
signaling
.

Finally
,
we
showed
that
Pa
was
not
able
to
induce
apoptosis
in
NCI-H292
cells
.

Our
results
suggest
that
CHAC1
is
involved
in
the
regulation
of
inflammation
in
bronchial
cells
during
Pa
infection
and
may
explain
the
excessive
inflammation
present
in
the
respiratory
tracts
of
patients
with
CF
.

Porcine
reproductive
and
respiratory
syndrome
(
PRRS
)
has
devastated
pig
industries
worldwide
for
many
years
.

It
is
caused
by
a
small
RNA
virus
(
PRRSV
)
,
which
targets
almost
exclusively
pig
monocytes
or
macrophages
.

In
the
present
study
,
five
SAGE

libraries
derived
from
0

,
12
,
16
and
24

)
produced
a
total
643,255
sequenced

with
91,807
unique
tags
.

Differentially

were
then
detected
using
the
Bayesian
framework
followed
by
gene/mRNA
assignment
,
arbitrary
selection
and
manual
annotation
,
which
determined
699
DE
genes
for
reactome
analysis
.

The
DAVID
,
KEGG
and
REACTOME
databases
assigned
573
of
the
DE
genes
into
six
biological
systems
,
60
functional
categories
and
504
pathways
.

The
six
systems
are
:
cellular
processes
,
genetic
information
processing
,
environmental
information
processing
,
metabolism
,
organismal
systems
and

DE
genes
into
ten

,
reflecting
their

along
these
five
time
points
.

Based
on
the
number
one

in

,
cell
growth

formed
the

responding

.

Our
investigation
also
focused
on
dominant
pathways
that
had
at
least
20
DE
genes
identified
,
multi-pathway
genes
that
were
involved
in
10
or
more
pathways
and
exclusively-expressed
genes
that
were
included
in
one
system
.

Overall
,
our
present
study
reported
a
large
set
of
DE
genes
,
compiled
a
comprehensive
coverage
of
pathways
,
and
revealed
systembased
reactomes
of
PAMs
infected
with
PRRSV
.

We
believe
that
our
reactome
data
provides
new
insight
into
molecular
mechanisms
involved
in
host
genetic
complexity
of
antiviral
activities
against
PRRSV
and
lays
a
strong
foundation
for
vaccine
development
to
control

Cell
membrane
proteins
are
believed
to
play
a
critical
role
in
the
pathogenesis
of
autoimmune
diseases
.

However
,
few
membrane
autoantigens
have
been
linked
with
Behçet
's
disease
.

Here
,
a
cell-chip
was
performed
to
identify
autoantibody
target
cells
,
and
the
suspected
autoantigens
were
detected
using
immunoblotting
.

The
amino
acid
sequences
of
the
detected
proteins
were
determined
using
LC-MALDI-TOF/TOF
.

Putative
proteins
were
recombinantly
expressed
and
purified
,
and
a
corresponding
ELISA
was
developed
and
clinically
validated
using
real
clinical
samples
.

It
was
found
that
a
36-kDa
membrane
protein
-annexin
A2
-was
detected
in
approximately
one-third
of
the
patients
'
blood
circulation
.

The
immunohistochemistry
results
showed
that
annexin
A2
was
highly
expressed
in
vascular
endothelial
cells
.

Moreover
,
vascular
involvement
was
significantly
higher
in
the
anti-annexin
A2
antibody-positive
group
versus
the
anti-annexin
A2
antibody-negative
group
among
all
the
clinical
samples
analyzed
,
indicating
that
annexin
A2
is
a
novel
endothelial
cell

antigen
involved
in

Background
:
While
the
risk
of
severe
complications
of
Middle
East
respiratory
syndrome
(
MERS
)
and
its
determinants
have
been
explored
in
previous
studies
,
a
systematic
analysis
of
published
articles
with
different
designs
and
populations
has
yet
to
be
conducted
.

The
present
study
aimed
to
systematically
review
the
risk
of
death
associated
with
MERS
as
well
as
risk
factors
for
associated
complications
.

Methods
:
PubMed
and
Web
of
Science
databases
were
searched
for
clinical
and
epidemiological
studies
on
confirmed
cases
of
MERS
.

Eligible
articles
reported
clinical
outcomes
,
especially
severe
complications
or
death
associated
with
MERS
.

Risks
of
admission
to
intensive
care
unit
(
ICU
)
,
mechanical
ventilation
and
death
were
estimated
.

Subsequently
,
potential
associations
between
MERS-associated
death
and
age
,
sex
,
underlying
medical
conditions
and
study
design
were
explored
.

Results
:
A
total
of
25
eligible
articles
were
identified
.

The
case
fatality
risk
ranged
from
14.5
to
100
%
,
with
the
pooled
estimate
at
39.1
%
.

The
risks
of
ICU
admission
and
mechanical
ventilation
ranged
from
44.4
to
100
%
and
from
25.0
to
100
%
,
with
pooled
estimates
at
78.2
and
73.0
%
,
respectively
.

These
risks
showed
a
substantial
heterogeneity
among
the
identified
studies
,
and
appeared
to
be
the
highest
in
case
studies
focusing
on
ICU
cases
.

We
identified
older
age
,
male
sex
and
underlying
medical
conditions
,
including
diabetes
mellitus
,
renal

,

,
as

In

.

Conclusions
:
The
heterogeneity
for
the
risk
of
death
and
severe
manifestations
was
substantially
high
among
the
studies
,
and
varying
study
designs
was
one
of
the
underlying
reasons
for
this
heterogeneity
.

A
statistical
estimation
of
the
risk
of
MERS
death
and
identification
of
risk
factors
must
be
conducted
,
particularly
considering
the
study
design
and
potential
biases
associated
with
case
detection
and
diagnosis
.

Circulative
transmission
of
viruses
in
the
Luteoviridae
,
such
as
cereal
yellow
dwarf
virus
(
CYDV
)
,
requires
a
series
of
precisely
orchestrated
interactions
between
virus
,
plant
,
and
aphid
proteins
.

Natural
selection
has
favored
these
viruses
to
be
retained
in
the
phloem
to
facilitate
acquisition
and
transmission
by
aphids
.

We
show
that
treatment
of
infected
oat
tissue
homogenate
with
sodium
sulfite
reduces
transmission
of
the
purified
virus
by
aphids
.

Transmission
electron
microscopy
data
indicated
no
gross
change
in
virion
morphology
due
to
treatments
.

However
,
treated
virions
were
not

Analysis
of
virus
preparations
using
nanoflow
liquid
chromatography
coupled
to
tandem
mass
spectrometry
revealed
a
number
of
host
plant
proteins
co-purifying
with
viruses
,
some
of
which
were
lost
following
sodium
sulfite
treatment
.

Using
targeted
mass
spectrometry
,
we
show
data
suggesting
that
several
of
the
virus-associated
host
plant
proteins
accumulated
to
higher
levels
in
aphids
that
were
fed
on
CYDV-infected
plants
compared
to
healthy
plants
.

We
propose
two
hypotheses
to
explain
these
observations
,
and
these
are
not
mutually
exclusive
:
(
a
)
that
sodium
sulfite
treatment
disrupts
critical
virion-host
protein
interactions
required
for
aphid
transmission
,
or
(
b
)
that
host
infection
with
CYDV
modulates
phloem
protein
expression
in
a
way
that
is
favorable
for
virus
uptake
by
aphids
.

Importantly
,
the
genes
coding
for
the
plant
proteins
associated
with
virus
may
be
examined
as
targets
in
breeding
cereal
crops
for
new
modes
of
virus
resistance
that
disrupt
phloem-virus
or
aphidvirus
interactions
.

Background
:
Bovine
respiratory
syncytial
virus
(
BRSV
)
is
one
of
the
major
pathogens
involved
in
the
bovine
respiratory
disease
(
BRD
)
complex
.

The
seroprevalence
to
BRSV
in
Norwegian
cattle
herds
is
high
,
but
its
role
in
epidemics
of
respiratory
disease
is
unclear
.

The
aims
of
the
study
were
to
investigate
the
etiological
role
of
BRSV
and
other
respiratory
viruses
in
epidemics
of
BRD
and
to
perform
phylogenetic
analysis
of
Norwegian
BRSV
strains
.

Results
:
BRSV
infection
was
detected
either
serologically
and/or
virologically
in
18
(
86
%
)
of
21
outbreaks
and
in
most
cases
as
a
single
viral
agent
.

When
serology
indicated
that
bovine
coronavirus
and/or
bovine
parainfluenza
virus
3
were
present
,
the
number
of
BRSV
positive
animals
in
the
herd
was
always
higher
,
supporting
the
view
of
BRSV
as
the
main
pathogen
.

Sequencing
of
the
G
gene
of
BRSV
positive
samples
showed
that
the
current
circulating
Norwegian
BRSVs
belong
to
genetic
subgroup
II
,
along
with
other
North
European
isolates
.

One
isolate
from
an
outbreak
in
Norway
in
1976
was
also
investigated
.

This
strain
formed
a
separate
branch
in
subgroup
II
,
clearly
different
from
the
current
Scandinavian
sequences
.

The
currently
circulating
BRSV
could
be
divided
into
two
different
strains
that
were
present
in
the
same
geographical
area
at
the
same
time
.

The
sequence
variations
between
the
two
strains
were
in
an
antigenic
important
part
of
the
G
protein
.

The
results
demonstrated
that
BRSV
is
the
most
important
etiological
agent
of
epidemics
of
BRD
in
Norway
and
that
it
often
acts
as
the
only
viral
agent
.

The
phylogenetic
analysis
of
the
Norwegian
strains
of
BRSV
and
several
previously
published
isolates
supported
the
theory
of
geographical
and
temporal
clustering
of
BRSV
.

Antimicrobial
stewardship
program
(
ASP
)
is
one
of
the
most
important
strategies
for
managing
infectious
disease
treatment
and
preventing
antimicrobial
resistance
.

The
successful
implementation
of
ASP
in
the
community
health
system
(
CHS
)
has
been
challenging
.

We
evaluated
perceptions
of
current
ASP
,
potential
setbacks
of
ASP
implementation
,
and
future
demands
on
ASP
services
among
physicians
and
pharmacists
in
the
CHS
.

The
qualitative
research
was
conducted
through
in-depth
individual
interviews
and
focus
group
discussions
with
11
physicians
and
11
pharmacists
.

In
addition
,
a
quantitative
gap
analysis
was
conducted
to
assess
the
different
awareness
and
demands
on
services
of
ASP
and
preferred
antimicrobial-related
problems
(
ARP
)
.

In
overall
,
perceptions
of
ASP
varied
by
profession
.

The
identified
setbacks
were
unorganized
institutional
leadership
,
the
undefined
roles
of
healthcare
professionals
,
a
lack
of
reimbursement
,
the
hierarchical
structure
of
the
health
system
,
and
the
labor-intensive
working
environment
of
pharmacy
services
.

Although
demands
for
ASP
improvement
were
similar
among
professionals
,
they
had
different
preferences
in
prioritizing
each
service
item
of
ASP/ARP
development
and
the
profession
responsible
for
each
service
.

Continuous
administrative
and
financial
investments
,
understanding
ASP
contents
,
ASP-specific
information
technology
,
and
interdisciplinary
collaboration
with
good
communication
among
healthcare
professions
are
needed
to
continue
the
progression
of
ASP
.

Antibiotic
resistance
is
on

to
an
increase

,
osteomyelitis
,
and
a
wide
variety
of
infections
.

The
ubiquity
of
this
microorganism
confounds
with
the
great
increase
in
antibiotic
resistance
and
have
bred
great
concern
worldwide

although
sporadic

have
also
been
reported
.

The
aim
of
our
study
is
to
describe
the
first
case
of
Klebsiella

harboring
the
blaOXA-48-like

in
Ecuador
.

We
characterized
a
new
plasmid
that
carry
OXA-48
and
could
be
the
source
of
future
outbreaks
.

The
strain
was
recovered
from
a
patient
with
cancer
previously
admitted
in
a
Ukrainian
hospital
,
suggesting
that
this
mechanism
of
resistance
could
be
imported
.

These
findings
highlight
the
importance
of
programs
based
on
active
molecular
surveillance
for
the
intercontinental

has
been
developed

However
,
the
immunogenicity
of
DNA
vaccines
,
specifically
of
those
applied
to
humans
,
needs
a
considerable
improvement
.

There
are
several
approaches
to
increase
DNA
vaccine
immunogenicity
.

One
approach
implies
the
modifications
of
the

thus
the

of

outbreaks
among

in
an
area
of
continuous
dispute
.

Initially
focused
on
enhancing

MECIDS
has
expanded
the
scope
of
its

Sepsis
is
a
life-threatening
organ
dysfunction
caused
by
a
dysregulated
host
response
to
infection
.

Sepsis
can
be
caused
by
a
broad
range
of
pathogens
;
however
,
bacterial
infections
represent
the
majority
of
sepsis
cases
.

Up
to
42
%
of
sepsis
presentations
are
culture
negative
,
suggesting
a
non-bacterial
cause
.

Despite
this
,
diagnosis
of
viral
sepsis
remains
very
rare
.

Almost
any
virus
can
cause
sepsis
in
vulnerable
patients
(
e.g.
,
neonates
,
infants
,
and
other
immunosuppressed
groups
)
.

The
prevalence
of
viral
sepsis
is
not
known
,
nor
is
there
enough
information
to
make
an
accurate
estimate
.

The
initial
standard
of
care
for
all
cases
of
sepsis
,
even
those
that
are
subsequently
proven
to
be
culture
negative
,
is
the
immediate
use
of
broad-spectrum
antibiotics
.

In
the
absence
of
definite
diagnostic
criteria
for
viral
sepsis
,
or
at
least
to
exclude
bacterial
sepsis
,
this
inevitably
leads
to
unnecessary
antimicrobial
use
,
with
associated
consequences
for
antimicrobial
resistance
,
effects
on
the
host
microbiome
and
excess
healthcare
costs
.

It
is
important
to
understand
non-bacterial
causes
of
sepsis
so
that
inappropriate
treatment
can
be
minimised
,
and
appropriate
treatments
can
be
developed
to
improve
outcomes
.

In
this
review
,
we
summarise
what
is
known
about
viral
sepsis
,
its
most
common
causes
,
and
how
the
immune
responses
to
severe
viral
infections
can
contribute
to
sepsis
.

We
also
discuss
strategies
to
improve
our
understanding
of
viral
sepsis
,
and
ways
we
can
integrate
this
new
information
into
effective
treatment
.

Interferons
(
IFNs
)
contribute
to
cell-intrinsic
antiviral
immunity
by
inducing
hundreds
of
interferon-stimulated
genes
(
ISGs
)
.

In
a
screen
to
identify
antiviral
ISGs
,
we
unexpectedly
found
that
LY6E
,
a
member
of
the
LY6/uPAR
family
,
enhanced
viral
infection
.

Here
,
we
show
that
viral
enhancement
by
ectopically
expressed
LY6E
extends
to
several
cellular
backgrounds
and
affects
multiple
RNA
viruses
.

LY6E
does
not
impair
IFN
antiviral
activity
or
signaling
,
but
rather
promotes
viral
entry
.

Using
influenza
A
virus
as
a
model
,
we
narrow
the
enhancing
effect
of
LY6E
to
uncoating
after
endosomal
escape
.

Diverse
mammalian
orthologs
of
LY6E
also
enhance
viral
infectivity
,
indicating
evolutionary
conservation
of
function
.

By
structure-function
analyses
,
we
identify
a
single
amino
acid
in
a
predicted
loop
region
that
is
essential
for
viral
enhancement
.

Our
study
suggests
that
LY6E
belongs
to
a
class
of
IFNinducible
host
factors
that
enhance
viral
infectivity
without
suppressing
IFN
antiviral
activity
.

Porcine
reproductive
and
respiratory
syndrome
virus
(

)
induces
a
weak
immune
response
enabling
it
to
persist
in
different
organs
of
infected
pigs
.

This
has
been
attributed
to
the
ability
of
PRRSV
to
influence
the
induction
of
cytokine
responses
.

In
this
study
,
we
investigated
the
cytokine
transcriptional
profiles
in
different
compartments
of
the
mediastinal

Compared
to

in
follicular

interfollicular
areas

Since
infertility
is
a
major
concern
following
chemotherapy
,
it
is
important
to
characterize
the
drug-specific
damage
to
the
reproductive
system
to
help
find
appropriate
protective
strategies
.

This
study
investigates
the
damage
on

ovary
maintained
in

for
6
days
,
and
exposed
for

.

At
the
end
of
culture
,
morphological
analyses
and
follicle
counts
showed
that
DOC
negatively
impacts
on
early

,
decreasing
primary
follicle
number
and
severely
affecting

.

Poor

was
mainly
due
to
effects
on
granulosa
cells
,
indicating
that
the
effects
of
DOC
on
oocytes
were
likely
to
be
secondary
to
granulosa
cell
damage
.

DOC
damages
growing
follicles
specifically
,
with
no
direct
effect
on
the
primordial
follicle
reserve
.

Immunostaining
and
western
blotting
showed
that
DOC
induces
activation
of
intrinsic
,
type
II
apoptosis
in
ovarian
somatic
cells
;
increasing
the
levels
of
cleaved
caspase
3
,
cleaved
caspase
8
,
Bax
and
cleaved
poly
(
ADP-ribose
)
polymerase
,
while
also
inducing
movement
of
cytochrome
C
from
mitochondria
into
the
cytosol
.

T3
did
not
prevent
the
damage
induced
by
the
low
dose
of
DOC
.

These
results
demonstrated
that
DOC
induces
a
gonadotoxic
effect
on
the
mouse
ovary
through
induction
of
somatic
cell
apoptosis
,
with
no
evidence
of
direct
effects
on
the
oocyte
,
and
that
the
damaging
effect
is
not
mitigated
by
T3
.

Viral
vaccine
vectors
have
shown
to
be
effective
in
inducing
a
robust
immune
response
against
the
vaccine
antigen
.

Newcastle
disease
virus
(
NDV
)
,
an
avian
paramyxovirus
,
is
a
promising
vaccine
vector
against
human
and
veterinary
pathogens
.

Avirulent
NDV
strains
LaSota
and
B1
have
long
track
records
of
safety
and
efficacy
.

Therefore
,
use
of
these
strains
as
vaccine
vectors
is
highly
safe
in
avian
and
non-avian
species
.

NDV
replicates
efficiently
in
the
respiratory
track
of
the
host
and
induces
strong
local
and
systemic
immune
responses
against
the
foreign
antigen
.

As
a
vaccine
vector
,
NDV
can
accommodate
foreign
sequences
with
a
good
degree
of
stability
and
as
a
RNA
virus
,
there
is
limited
possibility
for
recombination
with
host
cell
DNA
.

Using
NDV
as
a
vaccine
vector
in
humans
offers
several
advantages
over
other
viral
vaccine
vectors
.

NDV
is
safe
in
humans
due
to
host
range
restriction
and
there
is
no
pre-existing
antibody
to
NDV
in
the
human
population
.

NDV
is
antigenically
distinct
from
common
human
pathogens
.

NDV
replicates
to
high
titer
in
a
cell
line
acceptable
for
human
vaccine
development
.

Therefore
,
NDV
is
an
attractive
vaccine
vector
for
human
pathogens
for
which
vaccines
are
currently
not
available
.

NDV
is
also
an
attractive
vaccine
vector
for
animal
pathogens
.

This
study
investigated
the
diarrhoea
seasonality
and
its
potential
drivers
as
well
as
potential
opportunities
for
future
diarrhoea
control
and
prevention
in
China
.

Data
on
weekly
infectious
diarrhoea
cases
in
31
provinces
of
China
from
2005
to
2012
,
and
data
on
demographic
and
geographic
characteristics
,
as
well
as
climatic
factors
,
were
complied
.

A
cosinor
function
combined
with
a
Poisson
regression
was
used
to
calculate
the
three
seasonal
parameters
of
diarrhoea
in
different
provinces
.

Regression
tree
analysis
was
used
to
identify
the
predictors
of
diarrhoea
seasonality
.

Diarrhoea
cases
in
China
showed
a
bimodal
distribution
.

Diarrhoea
in
children
,5
years
was
more
likely
to
peak
in
fall-winter
seasons
,
while
diarrhoea
in
persons
.55
years
peaked
in
summer
.

Latitude
was
significantly
associated
with
spatial
pattern
of
diarrhoea
seasonality
,
with
peak
and
trough
times
occurring
earlier
at
high
latitudes
(
northern
areas
)
,
and
later
at
low
latitudes
(
southern
areas
)
.

The
annual
amplitudes
of
diarrhoea
in
persons
.5
5
years
increased
with
latitude
(
r5
0.62
,
P,0.001
)
.

Latitude
27.86
N
and
38.656
N
were
the
latitudinal
thresholds
for
diarrhoea
seasonality
in
China
.

Regional-specific
diarrhoea
control
and
prevention
strategies
may
be
optimal
for
China
.

More
attention
should
be
paid
to
diarrhoea
in
children
,5
years
during
fall-winter
seasons
.

Background/Objective
:
Describing
transmissibility
parameters
of
past
pandemics
from
diverse
geographic
sites
remains
critical
to
planning
responses
to
future
outbreaks
.

We
characterize
the
transmissibility
of
influenza
A
(
H1N1
)
pdm09
(
hereafter
pH1N1
)
in
South
Africa
during
2009
by
estimating
the
serial
interval
(
SI
)
,
the
initial
effective
reproductive
number
(
initial
R
t
)
and
the
temporal
variation
of
R
t
.

Methods
:
We
make
use
of
data
from
a
central
registry
of
all
pH1N1
laboratory-confirmed
cases
detected
throughout
South
Africa
.

Whenever
date
of
symptom
onset
is
missing
,
we
estimate
it
from
the
date
of
specimen
collection
using
a
multiple
imputation
approach
repeated
100
times
for
each
missing
value
.

We
apply
a
likelihood-based
method
(
method
1
)
for
simultaneous
estimation
of
initial
R
t
and
the
SI
;
estimate
initial
R
t
from
SI
distributions
established
from
prior
field
studies
(
method
2
)
;
and
the
Wallinga
and
Teunis
method
(
method
3
)
to
model
the
temporal
variation
of
R
t
.

Results
:
12,360
confirmed
pH1N1
cases
were
reported
in
the
central
registry
.

During
the
period
of
exponential
growth
of
the
epidemic
(
June
21
to
August
3
,
2009
)
,
we
simultaneously
estimate
a
mean
R
t
of
1.47
(
95
%
CI
:
1.30-1.72
)
and
mean
SI
of
2.78
days
(
95
%
CI
:
1.80-3.75
)
(
method
1
)
.

Field
studies
found
a
mean
SI
of
2.3
days
between
primary
cases
and
laboratoryconfirmed
secondary
cases
,
and
2.7
days
when
considering
both
suspected
and
confirmed
secondary
cases
.

Incorporating
the
SI
estimate
from
field
studies
using
laboratory-confirmed
cases
,
we
found
an
initial
R
t
of
1.43
(
95
%
CI
:
1.38-1.49
)
(
method
2
)
.

The
mean
R
t
peaked
at
2.91
(
95
%
CI
:
0.85-2.91
)
on
June
21
,
as
the
epidemic
commenced
,
and
R
t
.1
was
sustained
until
August
22
(
method
3
)
.

Conclusions
:
Transmissibility
characteristics
of
pH1N1
in
South
Africa
are
similar
to
estimates
reported
by
countries
outside
of
Africa
.

Estimations
using
the
likelihood-based
method
are
in
agreement
with
field
findings
.

To
support
their
replication
,
viruses
take
advantage
of
numerous
cellular
factors
and
processes
.

Recent
large-scale
screens
have
identified
hundreds
of
such
factors
,
yet
little
is
known
about
how
viruses
exploit
any
of
these
.

Influenza
virus
infection
post-translationally
activates
P58
IPK
,
a
cellular
inhibitor
of
the
interferon-induced
,
dsRNA-activated
eIF2a
kinase
,
PKR
.

Here
,
we
report
that
infection
of
P58
IPK
knockout
mice
with
influenza
virus
resulted
in
increased
lung
pathology
,
immune
cell
apoptosis
,
PKR
activation
,
and
mortality
.

Analysis
of
lung
transcriptional
profiles
,
including
those
induced
by
the
reconstructed
1918
pandemic
virus
,
revealed
increased
expression
of
genes
associated
with
the
cell
death
,
immune
,
and
inflammatory
responses
.

These
experiments
represent
the
first
use
of
a
mammalian
infection
model
to
demonstrate
the
role
of
P58
IPK
in
the
antiviral
response
.

Our
results
suggest
that
P58
IPK
represents
a
new
class
of
molecule
,
a
cellular
inhibitor
of
the
host
defense
(
CIHD
)
,
as
P58
IPK
is
activated
during
virus
infection
to
inhibit
virus-induced
apoptosis
and
inflammation
to
prolong
host
survival
,
even
while
prolonging
viral
replication
.

Upon
binding
to
double-stranded
RNA
or
double-stranded
DNA
,
OAS
proteins
and
cGAS
produce
nucleotide

and

(

,

)
,
respectively
;
this
leads
to
the
initiation
of
antiviral
responses
.

We
analyzed
the
evolutionary
history
of
the
MB21D1-TMEM173
and
OAS-RNASEL
axes
in
primates
and
bats
and
found
evidence
of
widespread
positive
selection
in
both
orders
.

In
TMEM173
,
residue
230
,
a
major
determinant
of
response
to
natural
ligands
and
to
mimetic
drugs
(
e.g.
,
DMXAA
)
,
was
positively
selected
in
Primates
and
Chiroptera
.

In
both
orders
,
selection
also
targeted
an
a-helix/loop
element
in
RNase
L
that
modulates
the
enzyme
preference
for
single-stranded
RNA
versus
stem
loops
.

Analysis
of
positively
selected
sites
in
OAS1
,
OAS2
,
and
MB21D1
revealed
parallel
evolution
,
with
the
corresponding
residues
being
selected
in
different
genes
.

As
this
can
not
result
from
gene
conversion
,
these
data
suggest
that
selective
pressure
acting
on
OAS
and
MB21D1
genes
is
related
to
nucleic
acid
recognition
and
to
the
specific
mechanism
of
enzyme
activation
,
which
requires
a
conformational
change
.

Finally
,
a
population
genetics-phylogenetics
analysis
in
humans
,
chimpanzees
,
and
gorillas
detected
several
positively
selected
sites
in
most
genes
.

Data
herein
shed
light
into
species-specific
differences
in
infection
susceptibility
and
in
response
to
synthetic
compounds
,
with
relevance
for
the
design
of
synthetic
compounds
as
vaccine
adjuvants
.

The
packaging
of
genomic
RNA
in
positive-sense
single-stranded
RNA
viruses
is
a
key
part
of
the
viral
infectious
cycle
,
yet
this
step
is
not
fully
understood
.

Unlike
double-stranded
DNA
and
RNA
viruses
,
this
process
is
coupled
with
nucleocapsid
assembly
.

The
specificity
of
RNA
packaging
depends
on
multiple
factors
:
(
i
)
one
or
more
packaging
signals
,
(
ii
)
RNA
replication
,
(
iii
)
translation
,
(
iv
)
viral
factories
,
and
(
v
)
the
physical
properties
of
the
RNA
.

The
relative
contribution
of
each
of
these
factors
to
packaging
specificity
is
different
for
every
virus
.

In
vitro
and
in
vivo
data
show
that
there
are
different
packaging
mechanisms
that
control
selective
packaging
of
the
genomic
RNA
during
nucleocapsid
assembly
.

The
goals
of
this
article
are
to
explain
some
of
the
key
experiments
that
support
the
contribution
of
these
factors
to
packaging
selectivity
and
to
draw
a
general
scenario
that
could
help
us
move
towards
a
better
understanding
of
this
step
of
the
viral
infectious
cycle
.

The
Collaborative
Cross
(
CC
)
is
a
multiparent
panel
of
recombinant
inbred
(
RI
)
mouse
strains
derived
from
eight
founder
laboratory
strains
.

RI
panels
are
popular
because
of
their
long-term
genetic
stability
,
which
enhances
reproducibility
and
integration
of
data
collected
across
time
and
conditions
.

Characterization
of
their
genomes
can
be
a
community
effort
,
reducing
the
burden
on
individual
users
.

Here
we
present
the
genomes
of
the
CC
strains
using
two
complementary
approaches
as
a
resource
to
improve
power
and
interpretation
of
genetic
experiments
.

Our
study
also
provides
a
cautionary
tale
regarding
the
limitations
imposed
by
such
basic
biological
processes
as
mutation
and
selection
.

A
distinct
advantage
of
inbred
panels
is
that
genotyping
only
needs
to
be
performed
on
the
panel
,
not
on
each
individual
mouse
.

The
initial
CC
genome
data
were
haplotype
reconstructions
based
on
dense
genotyping
of
the
most
recent
common
ancestors
(
MRCAs
)
of
each
strain
followed
by
imputation
from
the
genome
sequence
of
the
corresponding
founder
inbred
strain
.

The
MRCA
resource
captured
segregating
regions
in
strains
that
were
not
fully
inbred
,
but
it
had
limited
resolution
in
the
transition
regions
between
founder
haplotypes
,
and
there
was
uncertainty
about
founder
assignment
in
regions
of
limited
diversity
.

Here
we
report
the
whole
genome
sequence
of
69
CC
strains
generated
by
paired-end
short
reads
at
303
coverage
of
a
single
male
per
strain
.

Sequencing
leads
to
a
substantial
improvement
in
the
fine
structure
and
completeness
of
the
genomes
of
the
CC
.

Both
MRCAs
and
sequenced
samples
show
a
significant
reduction
in
the
genome-wide
haplotype
frequencies
from
two
wild-derived
strains
,
CAST/EiJ
and
PWK/PhJ
.

In
addition
,
analysis
of
the
evolution
of
the
patterns
of
heterozygosity
indicates
that
selection
against
three
wild-derived
founder
strains
played
a
significant
role
in
shaping
the
genomes
of
the
CC
.

The
sequencing
resource
provides
the
first
description
of
tens
of
thousands
of
new
genetic
variants
introduced
by
mutation
and
drift
in
the
CC
genomes
.

We
estimate
that
new
SNP
mutations
are
accumulating
in
each
CC
strain
at
a
rate
of
2.4
6
0.4
per
gigabase
per
generation
.

The
fixation
of
new
mutations
by
genetic
drift
has
introduced
thousands
of
new
variants
into
the
CC
strains
.

The
majority
of
these
mutations
are
novel
compared
to
currently
sequenced
laboratory
stocks
and
wild
mice
,
and
some
are
predicted
to
alter
gene
function
.

Approximately
one-third
of
the
CC
inbred
strains
have
acquired
large
deletions
(
.10
kb
)
many
of
which
overlap
known
coding
genes
and
functional
elements
.

The
sequence
of
these
mice
is
a
critical
resource
to
CC
users
,
increases
threefold
the
number
of
mouse
inbred
strain
genomes
available
publicly
,
and
provides
insight
into
the
effect
of
mutation
and
drift
on
common
resources
.

Background
:
Seasonal
respiratory
syncytial
virus
(
RSV
)
epidemics
occur
annually
in
temperate
climates
and
result
in
significant
pediatric
morbidity
and
increased
health
care
costs
.

Although
RSV
epidemics
generally
occur
between
October
and
April
,
the
size
and
timing
vary
across
epidemic
seasons
and
are
difficult
to
predict
accurately
.

Prediction
of
epidemic
characteristics
would
support
management
of
resources
and
treatment
.

Methods
:
The
goals
of
this
research
were
to
examine
the
empirical
relationships
among
early
exponential
growth
rate
,
total
epidemic
size
,
and
timing
,
and
the
utility
of
specific
parameters
in
compartmental
models
of
transmission
in
accounting
for
variation
among
seasonal
RSV
epidemic
curves
.

RSV
testing
data
from
Primary
Children
's
Medical
Center
were
collected
on
children
under
two
years
of
age
(
July
2001-June
2008
)
.

Simple
linear
regression
was
used
explore
the
relationship
between
three
epidemic
characteristics
(
final
epidemic
size
,
days
to
peak
,
and
epidemic
length
)
and
exponential
growth
calculated
from
four
weeks
of
daily
case
data
.

A
compartmental
model
of
transmission
was
fit
to
the
data
and
parameter
estimated
used
to
help
describe
the
variation
among
seasonal
RSV
epidemic
curves
.

Results
:
The
regression
results
indicated
that
exponential
growth
was
correlated
to
epidemic
characteristics
.

The
transmission
modeling
results
indicated
that
start
time
for
the
epidemic
and
the
transmission
parameter
co-varied
with
the
epidemic
season
.

The
conclusions
were
that
exponential
growth
was
somewhat
empirically
related
to
seasonal
epidemic
characteristics
and
that
variation
in
epidemic
start
date
as
well
as
the
transmission
parameter
over
epidemic
years
could
explain
variation
in
seasonal
epidemic
size
.

These
relationships
are
useful
for
public
health
,
health
care
providers
,
and
infectious
disease
researchers
.

Recent
studies
have
shown
that
gamma
interferon
(
IFN-γ
)
synergizes
with
IFN-α/β
to
inhibit
herpes
simplex
virus
type
1
(
HSV-1
)
replication
in
vitro
.

Since
IFN
response
represents
an
early
host
defense
event
against
viral
infection
and
the
fact
that
treatment
with
meliacine
,
a
plant
antiviral
,
ameliorate
the
severity
of
the
herpetic
infection
in
female
mice
infected
intravaginally
with
HSV-2
,
we
wanted
to
investigate
whether
the
administration
of
meliacine
to
HSV-2
infected
mice
could
altered
the
homoestasis
of
IFNs
host
response
.

For
this
purpose
we
studied
the
effect
of
the
compound
1-cinnamoyl-3,11-dihydroxymeliacarpin
(
CDM
)
,
which
is
the
responsible
for
meliacine
antiviral
action
,
on
the
HSV-2
inhibition
exerted
by
IFN
α
,
IFN-γ
or
their
combination
.

We
have
found
that
like
HSV-1
,
IFN-γ
synergizes
with
IFN-α
to
inhibit
HSV-2
replication
in
Vero
cells
.

While
treatment
with
IFN-α
or
IFN-γ
alone
has
weak
antiviral
action
,
HSV-2
plaque
formation
,
viral
replication
and
the
onset
of
viral
CPE
in
Vero
cells
are
synergistically
inhibited
by
interferon
combination
.

In
addition
,
CDM
treatment
contributes
to
protect
cells
from
virus
cytopathic
effect
and
causes
a
strong
inhibition
of
HSV-2
titer
.

Moreover
,
the
presence
of
CDM
for
2
h
before
IFN
induction
,
during
the
16
h
induction
period
,
only
for
24
h
after
infection
or
during
the
complete
IFN
treatment
period
,
reduces
virus
yields
in
an
additive
way
without
affecting
IFN
antiviral
action
.

The
results
reported
here
indicated
that
the
presence
of
CDM
did
not
alter
the
antiviral
activity
of
IFN-α
,
IFN-γ
or
the
synergism
exerted
by
their
combination
.

As
a
result
we
can
envision
that
the
administration
of
CDM
in
vivo
could
not
affect
the
biological
activity
of
IFNs
,
which
are
so
important
mediators
of
the
innate
resistance
to
HSV-2
infection
.

Base
on
the
sequence
of
S
genes
,
which
encode
spike
proteins
,
we
previously
identified
three
different
types
(
North
American
,
S
INDEL
,
and
S
large-DEL
types
)
of
porcine
epidemic
diarrhea
virus
(
PEDV
)
that
have
re-emerged
in
Japan
since
2013
.

Based
on
experimental
infections
with
the
North
American
and
S
large-DEL
types
,
we
also
hypothesized
that
PEDV
virulence
may
be
linked
to
the
S1
subunit
of
the
S
protein
.

To
test
this
hypothesis
,
we
have
now
assayed
in
gnotobiotic
piglets
various
recombinant
PEDVs
generated
by
reverse
genetics
.

Piglets
inoculated
with
CV777
maintained
in
National
Institute
of
Animal
Health
,
along
with
piglets
infected
with
a
recombinant
form
of
the
same
virus
,
developed
subclinical
to
mild
diarrhea
.

In
contrast
,
severe
watery
diarrhea
,
dehydration
,
weight
loss
,
astasia
,
and
high
mortality
were
observed
in
piglets
inoculated
with
recombinant
strains
in
which
the
S
gene
was
partially
or
fully
replaced
with
corresponding
sequences
from
the
highly
virulent
Japanese
PEDV
isolate
OKN-1/JPN/2013
.

Indeed
,
symptoms
resembled
those
in
piglets
inoculated
with
the
OKN-1/JPN/2013
,
and
were
especially
pronounced
in
younger
piglets
.

Collectively
,
the
data
demonstrate
that
the
S1
subunit
of
the
S
protein
is
an
important
determinant
of
PEDV
virulence
,
and
advance
development
of
new
vaccine
candidate
.

Background
:
Middle
East
respiratory
syndrome
coronavirus
(
MERS-CoV
)
is
considered
to
be
responsible
for
a
new
viral
epidemic
and
an
emergent
threat
to
global
health
security
.

This
study
describes
the
current
epidemiological
status
of
MERS-CoV
in
the
world
.

Methods
:
Epidemiological
analysis
was
performed
on
data
derived
from
all
MERS-CoV
cases
recorded
in
the
disease
outbreak
news
on
WHO
website
between
1.1.2017
and
17.1.2018
.

Demographic
and
clinical
information
as
well
as
potential
contacts
and
probable
risk
factors
for
mortality
were
extracted
based
on
laboratory-confirmed
MERS-CoV
cases
.

Results
:
A
total
of
229
MERS-CoV
cases
,
including
70
deaths
(
30.5
%
)
,
were
recorded
in
the
disease
outbreak
news
on
world
health
organization
website
over
the
study
period
.

Based
on
available
details
in
this
study
,
the
case
fatality
rate
in
both
genders
was
30.5
%
(
70/229
)
[
32.1
%
(
55/171
)
for
males
and
25.8
%
(
15/58
)
for
females
]
.

The
disease
occurrence
was
higher
among
men
[
171
cases
(
74.7
%
)
]
than
women
[
58
cases
(
25.3
%
)
]
.

Variables
such
as
comorbidities
and
exposure
to
MERS-CoV
cases
were
significantly
associated
with
mortality
in
people
affected
with
MERS-CoV
infections
,
and
adjusted
odds
ratio
estimates
were
2.2
(
95
%
CI
:
1.16
,
7.03
)
and
2.3
(
95
%
CI
:
1.35
,
8.20
)
,
respectively
.

All
age
groups
had
an
equal
chance
of
mortality
.

Conclusions
:
In
today
's
``
global
village
''
,
there
is
probability
of
MERS-CoV
epidemic
at
any
time
and
in
any
place
without
prior
notice
.

Thus
,
health
systems
in
all
countries
should
implement
better
triage
systems
for
potentially
imported
cases
of
MERS-CoV
to
prevent
large
epidemics
.

The
2009
pandemic
influenza
virus
caused
the
majority
of
the
influenza
A
virus
infections
in
China
in
2009
.

It
arrived
in
several
Chinese
cities
from
imported
cases
and
then
spread
as
people
travelled
domestically
by
all
means
of
transportation
,
among
which
road
traffic
was
the
most
commonly
used
for
daily
commuting
.

Spatial
variation
in
socioeconomic
status
not
only
accelerates
migration
across
regions
but
also
partly
induces
the
differences
in
epidemic
processes
and
in
responses
to
epidemics
across
regions
.

However
,
the
roles
of
both
road
travel
and
socioeconomic
factors
have
not
received
the
attention
they
deserve
.

Here
,
we
constructed
a
national
highway
network
for
and
between
333
cities
in
mainland
China
and
extracted
epidemiological
variables
and
socioeconomic
factors
for
each
city
.

We
calculated
classic
centrality
measures
for
each
city
in
the
network
and
proposed
two
new
measures
(
SumRatio
and
Multicenter
Distance
)
.

We
evaluated
the
correlation
between
the
centrality
measures
and
epidemiological
features
and
conducted
a
spatial
autoregression
to
quantify
the
impacts
of
road
network
and
socioeconomic
factors
during
the
outbreak
.

The
results
showed
that
epidemics
had
more
significant
relationships
with
both
our
new
measures
than
the
classic
ones
.

Higher
population
density
,
higher
per
person
income
,
larger
SumRatio
and
Multicenter
Distance
,
more
hospitals
and
college
students
,
and
lower
per
person
GDP
were
associated
with
higher
cumulative
incidence
.

Higher
population
density
and
number
of
slaughtered
pigs
were
found
to
advance
epidemic
arrival
time
.

Higher
population
density
,
more
colleges
and
slaughtered
pigs
,
and
lower
Multicenter
Distance
were
associated
with
longer
epidemic
duration
.

In
conclusion
,
road
transport
and
socioeconomic
status
had
significant
impacts
and
should
be
considered
for
the
prevention
and
control
of
future
pandemics
.

A
respiratory
disease
caused
by
a
novel
coronavirus
,
termed
the
severe
acute
respiratory
syndrome
coronavirus
(
SARS-CoV
)
,
was
first
reported
in
China
in
late
2002
.

The
subsequent
efficient
human-to-human
transmission
of
this
virus
eventually
affected
more
than
30
countries
worldwide
,
resulting
in
a
mortality
rate
of
~10
%
of
infected
individuals
.

The
spread
of
the
virus
was
ultimately
controlled
by
isolation
of
infected
individuals
and
there
has
been
no
infections
reported
since
April
2004
.

However
,
the
natural
reservoir
of
the
virus
was
never
identified
and
it
is
not
known
if
this
virus
will
re-emerge
and
,
therefore
,
research
on
this
virus
continues
.

The
SARS-CoV
genome
is
about
30
kb
in
length
and
is
predicted
to
contain
14
functional
open
reading
frames
(
ORFs
)
.

The
genome
encodes
for
proteins
that
are
homologous
to
known
coronavirus
proteins
,
such
as
the
replicase
proteins
(
ORFs
1a
and
1b
)
and
the
four
major
structural
proteins
:
nucleocapsid
(
N
)
,
spike
(
S
)
,
membrane
(
M
)
and
envelope
(
E
)
.

SARS-CoV
also
encodes
for
eight
unique
proteins
,
called
accessory
proteins
,
with
no
known
homologues
.

This
review
will
summarize
the
current
knowledge
on
SARS-CoV
accessory
proteins
and
will
include
:
(
i
)
expression
and
processing
;
(
ii
)
the
effects
on
cellular
processes
;
and

Infectious
bronchitis
virus
(
IBV
)
causes
highly
contagious
respiratory
or
urogenital
tract
diseases
in
chickens
.

The
Maryland
27
(
Md27
)
strain
was
first
isolated
in
1976
from
diseased
chicken
flocks
in
the
Delmarva
Peninsula
region
.

To
understand
the
genetic
diversity
and
phylogenetic
relationship
of
existing
strains
with
Md27
,
the
complete
nucleotide
sequence
of
the
3'end
coding
region
(
~7.2
kb
)
of
Md27
was
determined
and
compared
with
other
IBV
strains
and
coronaviruses
.

It
has
the
same
S-3-M-5-N-3
'
gene
order
,
as
is
the
case
of
other
IBV
strains
.

The
spike
gene
of
Md27
exhibits
97
%
identity
with
the
SE17
strain
.

There
are
deletions
at
the

and
at
the

(
UTR

,
which
is
different
from
Ark-like
strains
.

Phylogenetic
analysis
and
sequence

demonstrate
that
Md27
is
a
chimera
containing
different
gene
segments
that
are
most
closely
related
to
the
SE17
,
Conn
and
JMK
strains
.

This
current
study
provides
evidence
for
genomic
mutations
and
intergenic
recombination
that
have
taken
place
in
the
evolution
of
IBV

Background
:
In
September
2007
,
an
outbreak
of
acute
hemorrhagic
conjunctivitis
(
AHC
)
occurred
in
Keelung
City
and
spread
to
Taipei
City
.

In
response
to
the
epidemic
,
a
new
crisis
management
program
was
implemented
and
tested
in
Taipei
.

Having
noticed
that
transmission
surged
on
weekends
during
the
Keelung
epidemic
,
Taipei
City
launched
a
multi-channel
mass
risk
communications
program
that
included
short
message
service
(
SMS
)
messages
sent
directly
to
approximately
2.2
million
Taipei
residents
on
Friday
,
October
12th
,
2007
.

The
public
was
told
to
keep
symptomatic
students
from
schools
and
was
provided
guidelines
for
preventing
the
spread
of
the
disease
at
home
.

Epidemiological
characteristics
of
Taipei
's
outbreak
were
analyzed
from
461
sampled
AHC
cases
.

Median
time
from
exposure
to
onset
of
the
disease
was
1
day
.

This
was
significantly
shorter
for
cases
occurring
in
family
clusters
than
in
class
clusters
(
mean6SD
:
2.663.2
vs.
4.3964.82
days
,
p
=
0.03
)
,
as
well
as
for
cases
occurring
in
larger
family
clusters
as
opposed
to
smaller
ones
(
1.261.7
days
vs.
3.964.0
days
,
p,0.01
)
.

Taipei
's
program
had
a
significant
impact
on
patient
compliance
.

Home
confinement
of
symptomatic
children
increased
from
10
%
to
60
%
(
p,0.05
)
and
helped
curb
the
spread
of
AHC
.

Taipei
experienced
a
rapid
decrease
in
AHC
cases
between
the
Friday
of
the
SMS
announcement
and
the
following
Monday
,
October
15
,
(
0.70
%
vs.
0.36
%
)
.

By
October
26
,
AHC
cases
reduced
to
0.01
%
.

The
success
of
this
risk
communication
program
in
Taipei
(
as
compared
to
Keelung
)
is
further
reflected
through
rapid
improvements
in
three
epidemic
indicators
:
(
1
)
significantly
lower
crude
attack
rates
(
1.95
%
vs.
14.92
%
,
p,0.001
)
,
(
2
)
a
short
epidemic
period
of
AHC
(
13
vs.
34
days
)
,
and
(
3
)
a
quick
drop
in
risk
level
(
1,2
weeks
)
in
Taipei
districts
that
border
Keelung
(
the
original
domestic
epicenter
)
.

The
timely
launch
of
this
systematic
,
communication-based
intervention
proved
effective
at
preventing
a
dangerous
spike
in
AHC
and
was
able
to
bring
this
high-risk
disease
under
control
.

We
recommend
that
public
health
officials
incorporate
similar
methods
into
existing
guidelines
for
preventing
pandemic
influenza
and
other
emerging
infectious
diseases
.

Background
:
Development
of
a
fast
and
accurate
scoring
function
in
virtual
screening
remains
a
hot
issue
in
current
computer-aided
drug
research
.

Different
scoring
functions
focus
on
diverse
aspects
of
ligand
binding
,
and
no
single
scoring
can
satisfy
the
peculiarities
of
each
target
system
.

Therefore
,
the
idea
of
a
consensus
score
strategy
was
put
forward
.

Integrating
several
scoring
functions
,
consensus
score
re-assesses
the
docked
conformations
using
a
primary
scoring
function
.

However
,
it
is
not
really
robust
and
efficient
from
the
perspective
of
optimization
.

Furthermore
,
to
date
,
the
majority
of
available
methods
are
still
based
on
single
objective
optimization
design
.

Results
:
In
this
paper
,
two
multi-objective
optimization
methods
,
called
MOSFOM
,
were
developed
for
virtual
screening
,
which
simultaneously
consider
both
the
energy
score
and
the
contact
score
.

Results
suggest
that
MOSFOM
can
effectively
enhance
enrichment
and
performance
compared
with
a
single
score
.

For
three
different
kinds
of
binding
sites
,
MOSFOM
displays
an
excellent
ability
to
differentiate
active
compounds
through
energy
and
shape
complementarity
.

EFMOGA
performed
particularly
well
in
the
top
2
%
of
database
for
all
three
cases
,
whereas
MOEA_Nrg
and
MOEA_Cnt
performed
better
than
the
corresponding
individual
scoring
functions
if
the
appropriate
type
of
binding
site
was
selected
.

The
multi-objective
optimization
method
was
successfully
applied
in
virtual
screening
with
two
different
scoring
functions
that
can
yield
reasonable
binding
poses
and
can
furthermore
,
be
ranked
with
the
potentially
compromised
conformations
of
each
compound
,
abandoning
those
conformations
that
can
not
satisfy
overall
objective
functions
.

Influenza
is
a
major
acute
respiratory
infection
that
causes
mortality
and
morbidity
worldwide
.

Two
classes
of
conventional
antivirals
,
M2
ion
channel
blockers
and
neuraminidase
inhibitors
,
are
mainstays
in
managing
influenza
disease
to
lessen
symptoms
while
minimizing
hospitalization
and
death
in
patients
with
severe
influenza
.

However
,
the
development
of
viral
resistance
to
both
drug
classes
has
become
a
major
public
health
concern
.

Vaccines
are
prophylaxis
mainstays
but
are
limited
in
efficacy
due
to
the
difficulty
in
matching
predicted
dominant
viral
strains
to
circulating
strains
.

As
such
,
other
potential
interventions
are
being
explored
.

Since
viruses
rely
on
host
cellular
functions
to
replicate
,
recent
therapeutic
developments
focus
on
targeting
host
factors
involved
in
virus
replication
.

Besides
controlling
virus
replication
,
potential
targets
for
drug
development
include
controlling
virus-induced
host
immune
responses
such
as
the
recently
suggested
involvement
of
innate
lymphoid
cells
and
NADPH
oxidases
in
influenza
virus
pathogenesis
and
immune
cell
metabolism
.

In
this
review
,
we
will
discuss
the
advancements
in
novel
host-based
interventions
for
treating
influenza
disease
.

Next-generation
sequencing
(
NGS
)
approaches
rapidly
produce
millions
to
billions
of
short
reads
,
which
allow
pathogen
detection
and
discovery
in
human
clinical
,
animal
and
environmental
samples
.

A
major
limitation
of
sequence
homology-based
identification
for
highly
divergent
microorganisms
is
the
short
length
of
reads
generated
by
most
highly
parallel
sequencing
technologies
.

Short
reads
require
a
high
level
of
sequence
similarities
to
annotated
genes
to
confidently
predict
gene
function
or
homology
.

Such
recognition
of
highly
divergent
homologues
can
be
improved
by
reference-free
(
de
novo
)
assembly
of
short
overlapping
sequence
reads
into
larger
contigs
.

We
describe
an
ensemble
strategy
that
integrates
the
sequential
use
of
various
de
Bruijn
graph
and
overlap-layout-consensus
assemblers
with
a
novel
partitioned
sub-assembly
approach
.

We
also
proposed
new
quality
metrics
that
are
suitable
for
evaluating
metagenome
de
novo
assembly
.

We
demonstrate
that
this
new
ensemble
strategy
tested
using
in
silico
spike-in
,
clinical
and
environmental
NGS
datasets
achieved
significantly
better
contigs
than
current
approaches
.

A.K
.

and
M.M.S
.

contributed
equally
to
this
work
.

We
generated
the
near-full
genome
sequence
of
Middle
East
respiratory
syndrome
coronavirus
(
MERS-CoV
)
from
a
collected
nasal
sample
of
dromedary
camel
in
Egypt
.

The
newly
characterized
Egyptian
strain
has
high
similarity
to
the
previously
characterized
Egyptian
virus
and
both
of
viruses
fell
into
a
cluster
distinct
from
other
MERS-CoVs
.

Hantaviruses
are
hosted
by
rodents
,
insectivores
and
bats
.

Several
rodent-borne
hantaviruses
cause
two
diseases
that
share
many
features
in
humans
,
hemorrhagic
fever
with
renal
syndrome
in
Eurasia
or
hantavirus
cardiopulmonary
syndrome
in
the
Americas
.

It
is
thought
that
the
immune
response
plays
a
significant
contributory
role
in
these
diseases
.

However
,
in
reservoir
hosts
that
have
been
closely
examined
,
little
or
no
pathology
occurs
and
infection
is
persistent
despite
evidence
of
adaptive
immune
responses
.

Because
most
hantavirus
reservoirs
are
not
model
organisms
,
it
is
difficult
to
conduct
meaningful
experiments
that
might
shed
light
on
how
the
viruses
evade
sterilizing
immune
responses
and
why
immunopathology
does
not
occur
.

Despite
these
limitations
,
recent
advances
in
instrumentation
and
bioinformatics
will
have
a
dramatic
impact
on
understanding
reservoir
host
responses
to
hantaviruses
by
employing
a
systems
biology
approach
to
identify
important
pathways
that
mediate
virus/reservoir
relationships
.

Enterovirus
D68
(
EV-D68
)
is
an
emerging
pathogen
that
recently
caused
a
large
outbreak
of
severe
respiratory
disease
in
the
United
States
and
other
countries
.

Little
is
known
about
the
relationship
between
EV-D68
virus
and
host
cells
.

In
this
study
,
we
assessed
the
effect
of
the
host
cell
cycle
on
EV-D68
viral
production
,
as
well
as
the
ability
of
EV-D68
to
manipulate
host
cell
cycle
progression
.

The
results
suggest
that
synchronization
in
G0/G1
phase
,
but
not
S
phase
,
promotes
viral
production
,
while
synchronization
in
G2/M
inhibits
viral
production
.

Both
an
early
EV-D68
isolate
and
currently
circulating
strains
of
EV-D68
can
manipulate
the
host
cell
cycle
to
arrest
cells
in
the
G0/G1
phase
,
thus
providing
favorable
conditions
for
virus
production
.

Cell
cycle
regulation
by
EV-D68
was
associated
with
corresponding
effects
on
the
expression
of
cyclins
and
CDKs
,
which
were
observed
at
the
level
of
the
protein
and/or
mRNA
.

Furthermore
,
the
viral
non-structural
protein
3D
of
EV-D68
prevents
progression
from
G0/G1
to
S.
Interestingly
,
another
member
of
the
Picornaviridae
family
,
EV-A71
,
differs
from
EV-D68
in
that
G0/G1
synchronization
inhibits
,
rather
than
promotes
,
EV-A71
viral
replication
.

However
,
these
viruses
are
similar
in
that
G2/M
synchronization
inhibits
the
production
and
activity
of
both
viruses
,
which
is
suggestive
of
a
common
therapeutic
target
for
both
types
of
enterovirus
.

These
results
further
clarify
the
pathogenic
mechanisms
of
enteroviruses
and
provide
a
potential
strategy
for
the
treatment
and
prevention
of
EV-D68-related
disease
.

in
Jinan
,
northern
China
.

Nasal
and
throat
swabs
(
=
596
)
were
collected
from
adult
patients
with
URTIs
.

Nine
respiratory-related
viruses
,
including
IFV
,
PIV
,
HRV
,
HMPV
,
HBoV
,
HCoV
,
ADV
,
RSV
,
and
EV
,
were
detected
in
all
samples
by
conventional
and
reverse
transcription
polymerase
chain
reactions
.

Positive
detection
rate
for
respiratory
virus
was
38.76
%
and
codetection
rate
was
4.70
%
in
adults
with
acute
respiratory
tract
infections
.

IFV
(
20.81
%
)
was
the
dominant
agent
detected
and
IFVB
had
a
higher
incidence
(
12.58
%
)
than
IFVA
(
7.72
%
)
.

Detection
rates
of
8.22
%
,
5.03
%
,
3.69
%
,
and
2.52
%
were
observed
for
HBoV
,
HRV
,
EV
,
and
RSV
,
respectively
.

HCoV
had
the
lowest
detection
rate
of
0.50
%
.

HBoV
,
HRV
,
EV
,
and
ADV
infection
rates
were
higher
in
the
14-25-year-old
group
than
in
the
26-65-year-old
group
.

Codetection
rates
were
higher
(
7.52
%
)
in
the
14-25-year-old
group
than
in
the
older
age
group
(
2.64
%
)
.

The
spectrum
of
respiratory
virus
infection
in
adult
patients
with
URTIs
was
different
in
Jinan
compared
with
other
cities
in
China
.

Networks
are
often
used
to
model
the
contact
processes
that
allow
pathogens
to
spread
between
hosts
but
it
remains
unclear
which
models
best
describe
these
networks
.

One
question
is
whether
clustering
in
networks
,
roughly
defined
as
the
propensity
for
triangles
to
form
,
affects
the
dynamics
of
disease
spread
.

We
perform
a
simulation
study
to
see
if
there
is
a
signal
in
epidemic
transmission
trees
of
clustering
.

We
simulate
susceptible-exposed-infectious-removed
(
SEIR
)
epidemics
(
with
no
re-infection
)
over
networks
with
fixed
degree
sequences
but
different
levels
of
clustering
and
compare
trees
from
networks
with
the
same
degree
sequence
and
different
clustering
levels
.

We
find
that
the
variation
of
such
trees
simulated
on
networks
with
different
levels
of
clustering
is
barely
greater
than
those
simulated
on
networks
with
the
same
level
of
clustering
,
suggesting
that
clustering
can
not
be
detected
in
transmission
data
when
re-infection
does
not
occur

:
During
the
acute
phase
of
severe
acute
respiratory
syndrome
(
SARS
)
,
mononuclear
cells
infiltration
,
alveolar
cell
desquamation
and
hyaline
membrane
formation
have
been
described
,
together
with
dysregulation
of
plasma
cytokine
levels
.

Persistent
high-resolution
computed
tomography
(
HRCT
)
abnormalities
occur
in
SARS
patients
up
to
40
days
after
recovery
.

To
determine
further
the
time
course
of
recovery
of
lung
inflammation
,
we
investigated
the
HRCT
and
inflammatory
profiles
,
and
coronavirus
persistence
in
bronchoalveolar
lavage
fluid
(
BALF
)
of
12
patients
at
recovery
at
60
and
90
days
.

Results
:
At
60
days
,
compared
to
normal
controls
,
SARS
patients
had
increased
cellularity
of
BALF
with
increased
alveolar
macrophages
(
AM
)
and
CD8
cells
.

HRCT
scores
were
increased
and
correlated
with
T-cell
numbers
and
their
subpopulations
,
and
inversely
with
CD4/CD8
ratio
.

TNFα
,
IL-6
,
IL-8
,
RANTES
and
MCP-1
levels
were
increased
.

Viral
particles
in
AM
were
detected
by
electron
microscopy
in
7
of
12
SARS
patients
with
high
HRCT
score
.

On
day
90
,
HRCT
scores
improved
significantly
in
10
of
12
patients
,
with
normalization
of
BALF
cell
counts
in
6
of
12
patients
with
repeat
bronchoscopy
.

Pulse
steroid
therapy
and
prolonged
fever
were
two
independent
factors
associated
with
delayed
resolution
of
pneumonitis
,
in
this
non-randomized
,
retrospective
analysis
.

Resolution
of
pneumonitis
is
delayed
in
some
patients
during
SARS
recovery
and
may
be
associated
with
delayed
clearance
of
coronavirus
,
Complete
resolution
may
occur
by
90
days
or
later
.

The
ability
of
emerging
pathogens
to
infect
new
species
is
likely
related
to
the
diversity
of
pathogen
variants
present
in
existing
reservoirs
and
their
degree
of
genomic
plasticity
,
which
determines
their
ability
to
adapt
to
new
environments
.

Certain
simian
immunodeficiency
viruses
(
SIVcpz
,
SIVsm
)
have
demonstrated
tremendous
success
in
infecting
new
species
,
including
humans
,
resulting
in
the
HIV-1
and
HIV-2
epidemics
.

Although
SIV
diversification
has
been
studied
on
a
population
level
,
the
essential
substrates
for
cross-species
transmission
,
namely
SIV
sequence
diversity
and
the
types
and
extent
of
viral
diversification
present
in
individual
reservoir
animals
have
not
been
elucidated
.

To
characterize
this
intra-host
SIV
diversity
,
we
performed
sequence
analyses
of
clonal
viral
envelope
(
env
)
V1V2
and
gag
p27
variants
present
in
individual
SIVsm-infected
sooty
mangabeys
over
time
.

Results
:
SIVsm
demonstrated
extensive
intra-animal
V1V2
length
variation
and
amino
acid
diversity
(
le38
%
)
,
and
continual
variation
in
V1V2
N-linked
glycosylation
consensus
sequence
frequency
and
location
.

Positive
selection
was
the
predominant
evolutionary
force
.

Temporal
sequence
shifts
suggested
continual
selection
,
likely
due
to
evolving
antibody
responses
.

In
contrast
,
gag
p27
was
predominantly
under
purifying
selection
.

SIVsm
V1V2
sequence
diversification
is
at
least
as
great
as
that
in
HIV-1
infected
humans
,
indicating
that
extensive
viral
diversification
in
and
of
itself
does
not
inevitably
lead
to
AIDS
.

Positive
diversifying
selection
in
this
natural
reservoir
host
is
the
engine
that
has
driven
the
evolution
of
the
uniquely
adaptable
SIV/HIV
envelope
protein
.

These
studies
emphasize
the
importance
of
retroviral
diversification
within
individual
host
reservoir
animals
as
a
critical
substrate
in
facilitating
cross-species
transmission
.

Background
:
More
knowledge
about
viral
populations
in
wild
animals
is
needed
in
order
to
better
understand
and
assess
the
risk
of
zoonotic
diseases
.

In
this
study
we
performed
viral
metagenomic
analysis
of
fecal
samples
from
three
healthy
carnivores
:
a
badger
(
Meles
meles
)
,
a
mongoose
(
Herpestes
ichneumon
)
and
an
otter
(
Lutra
lutra
)
from
Portugal
.

Results
:
We
detected
the
presence
of
novel
highly
divergent
viruses
in
the
fecal
material
of
the
carnivores
analyzed
,
such
as
five
gemycircularviruses
.

Four
of
these
gemycircularviruses
were
found
in
the
mongoose
and
one
in
the
badger
.

In
addition
we
also
identified
an
RNA-dependent
RNA
polymerase
gene
from
a
putative
novel
member
of
the
Nodaviridae
family
in
the
fecal
material
of
the
otter
.

Conclusions
:
Together
these
results
underline
that
many
novel
viruses
are
yet
to
be
discovered
and
that
fecal
associated
viruses
are
not
always
related
to
disease
.

Our
study
expands
the
knowledge
of
viral
species
present
in
the
gut
,
although
the
interpretation
of
the
true
host
species
of
such
novel
viruses
needs
to
be
reviewed
with
great
caution
.

Viruses
must
parasitize
host
cell
translational
machinery
in
order
to
make
proteins
for
viral
progeny
.

In
this
study
,
we
sought
to
use
this
signal
transduction
conduit
against
them
by
inhibiting
multiple
kinases
that
influence
translation
.

Previous
work
indicated
that
several
kinases
involved
in
translation
,
including
p70
S6K
,
p90RSK
,
ERK
,
and
p38
MAPK
,
are
phosphorylated
following
Rift
Valley
fever
virus
(
RVFV
)
infection
.

Furthermore
,
inhibiting
p70
S6K
through
treatment
with
the
FDA
approved
drug
rapamycin
prevents
RVFV
pathogenesis
in
a
mouse
model
of
infection
.

We
hypothesized
that
inhibiting
either
p70
S6K
,
p90RSK
,
or
p90RSK
's
upstream
kinases
,
ERK
and
p38
MAPK
,
would
decrease
translation
and
subsequent
viral
replication
.

Treatment
with
the
p70
S6K
inhibitor
PF-4708671
resulted
in
decreased
phosphorylation
of
translational
proteins
and
reduced
RVFV
titers
.

In
contrast
,
treatment
with
the
p90RSK
inhibitor
BI-D1870
,
p38MAPK
inhibitor
SB203580
,
or
the
ERK
inhibitor
PD0325901
alone
had
minimal
influence
on
RVFV
titers
.

The
combination
of
PF-4708671
and
BI-D1870
treatment
resulted
in
robust
inhibition
of
RVFV
replication
.

Likewise
,
a
synergistic
inhibition
of
RVFV
replication
was
observed
with
p38MAPK
inhibitor
SB203580
or
the
ERK
inhibitor
PD0325901
combined
with
rapamycin
treatment
.

These
findings
serve
as
a
proof
of
concept
regarding
combination
kinase
inhibitor
treatment
for
RVFV
infection
.

Protein
toxins
confer
a
defense
against
predation/grazing
or
a
superior
pathogenic
competence
upon
the
producing
organism
.

Such
toxins
have
been
perfected
through
evolution
in
poisonous
animals/plants
and
pathogenic
bacteria
.

Over
the
past
five
decades
,
a
lot
of
effort
has
been
invested
in
studying
their
mechanism
of
action
,
the
way
they
contribute
to
pathogenicity
and
in
the
development
of
antidotes
that
neutralize
their
action
.

In
parallel
,
many
research
groups
turned
to
explore
the
pharmaceutical
potential
of
such
toxins
when
they
are
used
to
efficiently
impair
essential
cellular
processes
and/or
damage
the
integrity
of
their
target
cells
.

The
following
review
summarizes
major
advances
in
the
field
of
toxin
based
therapeutics
and
offers
a
comprehensive
description
of
the
mode
of
action
of
each
applied
toxin
.

The
current
standard
care
therapy
for
hepatitis
C
virus
(
HCV
)
infection
consists
of
two
regimes
,
namely
interferon-based
and
interferon-free
treatments
.

The
treatment
through
the
combination
of
ribavirin
and
pegylated
interferon
is
expensive
,
only
mildly
effective
,
and
is
associated
with
severe
side
effects
.

In
2011
,
two
direct-acting
antiviral
(
DAA
)
drugs
,
boceprevir
and
telaprevir
,
were
licensed
that
have
shown
enhanced
sustained
virologic
response
(
SVR
)
in
phase
III
clinical
trial
,
however
,
these
interferon-free
treatments
are
more
sensitive
to
HCV
genotype
1
infection
.

The
variable
nature
of
HCV
,
and
the
limited
number
of
inhibitors
developed
thus
aim
in
expanding
the
repertoire
of
available
drug
targets
,
resulting
in
targeting
the
virus
assembly
therapeutically
.

(
isolatek3a
)
and
HCV
genotype
4a
(
GT4
)
(
isolateED43
)
.

Furthermore
,
we
conducted
a
quantitative
structure-activity
relationship
and
docking
interaction
study
.

The
drug
NB-DNJ
formed
the
highest
number
of
hydrogen
bond
interactions
with
both
modeled
p7
proteins
with
high
interaction
energy
,
followed
by
BIT225
.

A
flavonoid
screen
demonstrated
that
Epigallocatechin
gallate
(
EGCG
)
,
nobiletin
,
and
quercetin
,
have
more
binding
modes
in
GT3
than
in
GT4
.

Thus
,
the
predicted
p7
protein
molecule
of
HCV
from
GT3
and
GT4
provides
a
general
avenue
to
target
structure-based
antiviral
compounds
.

We
hypothesize
that
the
inhibitors
of
viral
p7
identified
in
this
screen
may
be
a
new
class
of
potent
agents
,
but
further
confirmation
in
vitro
and
in
vivo
is
essential
.

This
structure-guided
drug
design
for
both
GT3
and
GT4
can
lead
to
the
identification
of
drug-like
natural
compounds
,
confirming
p7
as
a
new
target
in
the
rapidly
increasing
era
of
HCV

Objective
:
To
describe
a
pilot
surveillance
program
established
in
health
facilities
in
Yaoundé
,
Cameroon
in
2017
which
aimed
to
enable
detection

reporting
of
public

.

Health
Laboratory
,
implemented
event-based
surveillance
(
EBS
)
in
nine
Yaoundé
health
facilities
.

Four
signals
were
defined
that
could
indicate
possible
public
health
events
,
and
a
reporting
,
triage
,
and
verification
system
was
established
among
partner
organizations
.

A
pre-defined
laboratory
algorithm
was
defined
,
and
a
series
of
workshops
trained
health
facilities
,
laboratory
,
and
public
health
staff
for
surveillance
implementation
.

:
From
May
2017
to
January
2018
,
30
signals
were
detected
,
corresponding
to
15
unusual
respiratory
events
.

All
health
facilities
reported
a
signal
at
least
once
,
and
more
than
three-quarters
of
health
facilities
reported
≥2
times
.

Among
specimens
tested
,
the
pathogens
detected
included
Klebsiella

,
Moraxella
catarrhalis
,
Streptococcus

,
Haemophilus

,
Staphylococcus

,
Pneumocystis

,
influenza
A
(

virus
,
rhinovirus
,
and
adenovirus
.

The
events
detected
in
this
pilot
were
caused
by
routine
respiratory
bacteria
and
viruses
,
and
no
novel
influenza

or
other
emerging

were
identified
.

The

,
however
,
strengthened

The
NMR
represents
an
attractive
animal
model
in
longevity
and
cancer
research
,
but
there
are
no

implicated
for
the

used
them
for
an
immunophenotyping
of
leukocyte
subsets
of
peripheral
blood
,
spleen
and
bone
marrow
samples
.

Overall
,
we
found
that
the
leukocyte
composition
of
NMR
peripheral

is
comparable
to
that
of

Notably
,
the

including
activity
of
the
INK4
locus
and
mutation
of
the
ERAS
oncogene
[

,
but
they
were
not
related
to
the

Classical
swine
fever
(
CSF
)
causes
major
losses
in
pig
farming
,
with
various
degrees
of
disease
severity
.

Efficient
live
attenuated
vaccines
against
classical
swine
fever
virus
(
CSFV
)
are
used
routinely
in
endemic
countries
.

However
,
despite
intensive
vaccination
programs
in
these
areas
for
more
than
20
years
,
CSF
has
not
been
eradicated
.

Molecular
epidemiology
studies
in
these
regions
suggests
that
the
virus
circulating
in
the
field
has
evolved
under
the
positive
selection
pressure
exerted
by
the
immune
response
to
the
vaccine
,
leading
to
new
attenuated
viral
variants
.

Recent
work
by
our
group
demonstrated
that
a
high
proportion
of
persistently
infected
piglets
can
be
generated
by
early
postnatal
infection
with
low
and
moderately
virulent
CSFV
strains
.

Here
,
we
studied
the
immune
response
to
a
hog
cholera
lapinised
virus
vaccine
(
HCLV
)
,
C-strain
,
in
six-week-old
persistently
infected
pigs
following
post-natal
infection
.

CSFV-negative
pigs
were
vaccinated
as
controls
.

The
humoral
and
interferon
gamma
responses
as
well
as
the
CSFV
RNA
loads
were
monitored
for
21
days
post-vaccination
.

No
vaccine
viral
RNA
was
detected
in
the
serum
samples
and
tonsils
from
CSFV
postnatally
persistently
infected
pigs
for
21
days
post-vaccination
.

Furthermore
,
no
E2-specific
antibody
response
or
neutralising
antibody
titres
were
shown
in
CSFV
persistently
infected
vaccinated
animals
.

Likewise
,
no
of
IFN-gamma
producing
cell
response
against
CSFV
or
PHA
was
observed
.

To
our
knowledge
,
this
is
the
first
report
demonstrating
the
absence
of
a
response
to
vaccination
in
CSFV
persistently
infected
pigs
.

Bacterial
and
viral
co-infections
of
the
respiratory
tract
are
life-threatening
and
present
a
global
burden
to
the
global
community
.

Staphylococcus
aureus
,
Streptococcus
pneumoniae
,
and
Streptococcus
pyogenes
are
frequent
colonizers
of
the
upper
respiratory
tract
.

Imbalances
through
acquisition
of
seasonal
viruses
,
e.g.
,
Influenza
A
virus
,
can
lead
to
bacterial
dissemination
to
the
lower
respiratory
tract
,
which
in
turn
can
result
in
severe
pneumonia
.

In
this
review
,
we
summarize
the
current
knowledge
about
bacterial
and
viral
co-infections
of
the
respiratory
tract
and
focus
on
potential
experimental
models
suitable
for
mimicking
this
disease
.

Transmission
of
IAV
and
pneumonia
is
mainly
modeled
by
mouse
infection
.

Few
studies
utilizing
ferrets
,
rats
,
guinea
pigs
,
rabbits
,
and
non-human
primates
are
also
available
.

The
knowledge
gained
from
these
studies
led
to
important
discoveries
and
advances
in
understanding
these
infectious
diseases
.

Nevertheless
,
mouse
and
other
infection
models
have
limitations
,
especially
in
translation
of
the
discoveries
to
humans
.

Here
,
we
suggest
the
use
of
human
engineered
lung
tissue
,
human
ex
vivo
lung
tissue
,
and
porcine
models
to
study
respiratory
co-infections
,
which
might
contribute
to
a
greater
translation
of
the
results
to
humans
and
improve
both
,
animal
and
human
health
.

Predicting
the
hosts
of
newly
discovered
viruses
is
important
for
pandemic
surveillance
of
infectious
diseases
.

We
investigated
the
use
of
alignment-based
and
alignment-free
methods
and
support
vector
machine
using
mononucleotide
frequency
and
dinucleotide
bias
to
predict
the
hosts
of
viruses
,
and
applied
these
approaches
to
three
datasets
:
rabies
virus
,
coronavirus
,
and
influenza
A
virus
.

For
coronavirus
,
we
used
the
spike
gene
sequences
,
while
for
rabies
and
influenza
A
viruses
,
we
used
the
more
conserved
nucleoprotein
gene
sequences
.

We
compared
the
three
methods
under
different
scenarios
and
showed
that
their
performances
are
highly
correlated
with
the
variability
of
sequences
and
sample
size
.

For
conserved
genes
like
the
nucleoprotein
gene
,
longer
k-mers
than
mono-and
dinucleotides
are
needed
to
better
distinguish
the
sequences
.

We
also
showed
that
both
alignmentbased
and
alignment-free
methods
can
accurately
predict
the
hosts
of
viruses
.

When
alignment
is
difficult
to
achieve
or
highly
time-consuming
,
alignment-free
methods
can
be
a
promising
substitute
to
predict
the
hosts
of
new
viruses
.

Viruses
are
ubiquitous
and
can
reproduce
and
evolve
very
fast
.

Virus
infections
in
human
can
cause
various
diseases
and
are
a
big
threat
to
human
health
.

Many
infectious
disease
studies
showed
that
virus
cross-species
transmissions
are
highly
prevalent
resulting
in
emerging
infectious
diseases
(
EIDs
)
1
.

EIDs
continue
to
pose
significant
public
health
problems
as
shown
by
the
recent
outbreaks
of
West
Nile
virus
,
SARS
,
MARS
,
and
H1N1
2
.

Rapidly
identifying
the
reservoir
of
the
new
pathogenic
bacterial
or
viral
origins
responsible
for
these
diseases
will
help
the
containment
,
control
,
and
prevention
of
the
outbreaks
1,3,4
.

Further
,
investigating
the
potential
host
of
a
virus
can
throw
light
on
the
evolutionary
history
of
the
virus
,
thus
provide
guidance
on
how
to
cut
off
the
transmission
path
.

The
biological
presumption
for
most
of
the
host
identification
methods
is
that
the
more
similar
two
viruses
'
DNA/RNA
sequences
are
,
they
are
more
likely
to
share
the
same
host
5
.

With
the
availability
of
various
databases
containing
different
types
of
pathogenic
microbial
species
,
one
of
the
most
commonly
used
approaches
for
identifying
the
origin
of
the
new
pathogen
responsible
for
an
EID
is
to
find
similar
sequences
in
the
pathogen
databases
using
alignment
by
the
Smith-Waterman
algorithm
6
,
BLAST
7
,
or
other
alignment
tools
.

Recently
,
several
alignment-free
methods
have
been
developed
for
the
identification
of
the
hosts
of
pathogenic
species
.

Kapoor
et
al
.

8
used
relative
dinucleotide
frequencies
and
discriminant
analysis
to
infer
the
hosts
of
novel
picorna-like
viruses
.

Aguas
and
Ferguson
9
developed
a
feature
selection
method
and
used
random
forests
(
RF
)
based
on
the
diverged
nucleotide
or
amino
acid
bases
among
a
set
of
aligned
molecular
sequences
to
predict
the
host
species
of
pathogens
.

Tang
et
al
.

10
developed
a
support
vector
machine
(
SVM
)
based
method
using
monoand
dinucleotide
frequencies
as
features
to
detect
the
original
hosts
of
coronaviruses
with
high
accuracy
.

Kargarfard
et
al
.

11
predicted
the
host
range
of
the
influenza
virus
using
various
machine
learning
approaches
.

Several
new
alignment-free
statistics
including
⁎
d
2
and
d
S
2
for
molecular
sequence
comparison
using
k-mers
(
k-grams
,
words
,
etc
.
)

were
developed
recently
12,13
.

It
was
shown
that
such
measures
are
highly
associated
with
the
evolutionary
distances
estimated
from
alignment-based
methods
,
thus
validating
the
usefulness
of
alignment-free

Background
:
Patients
with
suspected
Middle
East
respiratory
syndrome
coronavirus
(
MERS-CoV
)
infection
should
be
hospitalized
in
isolation
wards
to
avoid
transmission
.

This
suspicion
can
also
lead
to
medical
confusion
and
inappropriate
management
of
acute
respiratory
syndrome
due
to
causes
other
than
MERS-CoV
.

Methods
:
We
studied
the
characteristics
and
outcome
of
patients
hospitalized
for
suspected
MERS-CoV
infection
in
the
isolation
wards
of
two
referral
infectious
disease
departments
in
the
Paris
area
between
January
2013
and
December
2016
.

Results
:
Of
93
adult
patients
(
49
male
(
52.6
%
)
,
median
age
63.4
years
)
hospitalized
,
82
out
of
93
adult
patients
had
returned
from
Saudi
Arabia
,
and
74
of
them
were
pilgrims
(
Hajj
)
.

Chest
X-ray
findings
were
abnormal
in
72
(
77
%
)
patients
.

The
93
patients
were
negative
for
MERS-CoV
RT-PCR
,
and
70
(
75.2
%
)
patients
had
documented

.

The
median
duration
of

was
3
days
(
1-33
)
and
24
h
(
8-92
)
,
respectively
.

Time
of

Conclusion
:
The
management
of
patients
with
possible
MERS-CoV
infection
requires
medical
facilities
with
trained
personnel
,
and
rapid
access
to
virological
results
.

Empirical
treatment
with
neuraminidase
inhibitors
and
an
association
of
antibiotics
effective
against
S.
pneumoniae
and
L.
pneumophila
are
the
cornerstones
of
the
management
of
patients
hospitalized
for
suspected
MERS-CoV
infection
.

Canine
parvovirus
(
CPV
)
is
a
common
etiological
agent
of
acute
enteritis
,
which
occurs
globally
in
domestic
and
wild
carnivores
.

Despite
the
widespread
use
of
inactivated
or
live
attenuated
vaccines
,
the
emergence
of
antigenic
variants
and
the
influence
of
maternal
antibodies
have
raised
some
concerns
regarding
the
efficacy
of
commercial
vaccines
.

While
no
specific
antiviral
therapy
for
CPV
infection
exists
,
the
only
treatment
option
for
the
infection
is
supportive
therapy
based
on
symptoms
.

Thus
,
there
is
an
urgent
medical
need
to
develop
antiviral
therapeutic
options
to
reduce
the
burden
of
CPV-related
disease
.

In
this
study
,
a
cytopathic
effect
(
CPE
)
-based
high-throughput
screening
assay
was
used
to
screen
CPV
inhibitors
from
a
Food
and
Drug
Administration
(
FDA
)
-approved
drug
library
.

After
two
rounds
of
screening
,
seven
out
of
1430
screened
drugs
were
found
to
have
>
50
%
CPE
inhibition
.

Three
drugs-Nitazoxanide
,
Closantel
Sodium
,
and
Closantel-with
higher
anti-CPV
effects
were
further
evaluated
in
F81
cells
by
absolute
PCR
quantification
and
indirect
immunofluorescence
assay
(
IFA
)
.

The
inhibitory
effects
of
all
three
drugs
were
dose-dependent
.

Time
of
addition
assay
indicated
that
the
drugs
inhibited
the
early
processes
of
the
CPV
replication
cycle
,
and
the
inhibition
effects
were
relatively
high
within
2
h
postinfection
.

Western
blot
assay
also
showed
that
the
three
drugs
had
broad-spectrum
antiviral
activity
against
different
subspecies
of
three
CPV
variants
.

In
addition
,
antiapoptotic
effects
were
observed
within
12
h
in
Nitazoxanide-treated
F81
cells
regardless
of
CPV
infection
,
while
Closantel
Sodium-or
Closantel-treated
cells
had
no
proor
antiapoptotic
effects
.

In
conclusion
,
Nitazoxanide
,
Closantel
Sodium
,
and
Closantel
can
effectively
inhibit
different
subspecies
of
CPV
.

Since
the
safety
profiles
of
FDA-approved
drugs
have
already
been
extensively
studied
,
these
three
drugs
can
potentially
become
specific
and
effective
anti-CPV
drugs
.

Coronaviruses
,
such
as
severe
acute
respiratory
syndrome
coronavirus
and
Middle
East
respiratory
syndrome
coronavirus
,
pose
significant
public
health
threats
.

Bats
have
been
suggested
to
act
as
natural
reservoirs
for
both
these
viruses
,
and
periodic
monitoring
of
coronaviruses
in
bats
may
thus
provide
important
clues
about
emergent
infectious
viruses
.

The
Eastern
bent-wing
bat
Miniopterus
fuliginosus
is
distributed
extensively
throughout
China
.

We
therefore
analyzed
the
genetic
diversity
of
coronaviruses
in
samples
of
M.
fuliginosus
collected
from
nine
Chinese
provinces
during
2011-2013
.

The
only
coronavirus
genus
found
was
Alphacoronavirus
.

We
established
six
complete
and
five
partial
genomic
sequences
of
alphacoronaviruses
,
which
revealed
that
they
could
be
divided
into
two
distinct
lineages
,
with
close
relationships
to
coronaviruses
in
Miniopterus
magnater
and
Miniopterus
pusillus
.

Recombination
was
confirmed
by
detecting
putative
breakpoints
of
Lineage
1
coronaviruses
in
M.
fuliginosus
and
M.
pusillus
(
Wu
et
al.
,
2015
)
,
which
supported
the
results
of
topological
and
phylogenetic
analyses
.

The
established
alphacoronavirus
genome
sequences
showed
high
similarity
to
other
alphacoronaviruses
found
in
other
Miniopterus
species
,
suggesting
that
their
transmission
in
different
Miniopterus
species
may
provide
opportunities
for
recombination
with
different
alphacoronaviruses
.

The
genetic
information

improve
our
understanding

Human
respiratory
syncytial
virus

causes
acute
and
severe
lower
respiratory
tract
illness

RSV
strongly
upregulates
proinflammatory
cytokines

,
significantly
suppressed

expression
and
adhesion
of
fluorescein-labeled
S.

cells
to

The
RSV-induced
S.

adhesion
was
thought
to
be
mediated
by
the

CAM
,
which
exhibits
antimicrobial

immunomodulatory
activities
,
was
found
in
this

to
suppress
the
RSV-induced
adhesion
of
respiratory
disease-causing
bacteria
,
S.

,
to
host
cells

Thus
,
CAM
might
suppress

prevent
secondary
bacterial

Background
:
During
the
SARS
pandemic
in
Hong
Kong
,
panic
and
worry
were
prevalent
in
the
community
and
the
general
public
avoided
staying
in
public
areas
.

Such
avoidance
behaviors
could
greatly
impact
daily
routines
of
the
community
and
the
local
economy
.

This
study
examined
the
prevalence
of
the
avoidance
behaviors
(
i.e
.

avoiding
going
out
,
visiting
crowded
places
and
visiting
hospitals
)
and
negative
psychological
responses
of
the
general
population
in
Hong
Kong
at
the
initial
stage
of
the
H1N1
epidemic
.

Methods
:
A
sample
of
999
respondents
was
recruited
in
a
population-based
survey
.

Using
random
telephone
numbers
,
respondents
completed
a
structured
questionnaire
by
telephone
interviews
at
the
'pre-community
spread
phase
'
of
the
H1N1
epidemic
in
Hong
Kong
.

Results
:
This
study
found
that
76.5
%
of
the
respondents
currently
avoided
going
out
or
visiting
crowded
places
or
hospitals
,
whilst
15
%
felt
much
worried
about
contracting
H1N1
and
6
%
showed
signs
of
emotional
distress
.

Females
,
older
respondents
,
those
having
unconfirmed
beliefs
about
modes
of
transmissions
,
and
those
feeling
worried
and
emotionally
distressed
due
to
H1N1
outbreak
were
more
likely
than
others
to
adopt
some
avoidance
behaviors
.

Those
who
perceived
high
severity
and
susceptibility
of
getting
H1N1
and
doubted
the
adequacy
of
governmental
preparedness
were
more
likely
than
others
to
feel
emotionally
distressed
.

The
prevalence
of
avoidance
behaviors
was
very
high
.

Cognitions
,
including
unconfirmed
beliefs
about
modes
of
transmission
,
perceived
severity
and
susceptibility
were
associated
with
some
of
the
avoidance
behaviors
and
emotional
distress
variables
.

Public
health
education
should
therefore
provide
clear
messages
to
rectify
relevant
perceptions
.

Background
:
Dengue
is
endemic
throughout
Cambodia
,
a
country
faced
with
significant
health
and
economic
challenges
.

We
undertook
a
clinical
study
at
the
National
Paediatric
Hospital
in
Phnom
Penh
to
evaluate
clinical
diagnostic
parameters
for
dengue
and
predictors
of
disease
outcome
.

Methods
:
Between
September
2011
and
January
2013
,
all
consecutive
inpatients
aged
between
1
and
15
years
and
presenting
with
suspected
dengue
were
enrolled
.

They
were
clinically
assessed
using
both
the
1997
and
2009
WHO
dengue
classifications
.

Specimens
were
collected
upon
admission
and
discharge
and
tested
for
dengue
at
Institut
Pasteur
in
Cambodia
.

Results
:
A
total
of
701
patients
were
screened
.

Of
these
,
79
%
were
dengue-confirmed
by
laboratory
testing
,
and
21
%
tested
dengue-negative
.

A
positive
tourniquet
test
,
absence
of
upper
respiratory
symptoms
,
leukopenia
,
thrombocytopenia
,
and
elevated
liver
transaminases
were
independent
predictors
for
laboratory-confirmed
dengue
among
the
children
.

The
presence
of
several
warning
signs
on
hospital
admission
was
associated
with
a
concurrent
laboratory-confirmed
diagnosis
of
severe
disease
outcome
.

Conclusions
:
The
presence
of
two
or
more
warning
signs
was
associated
with
a
concurrent
laboratory-confirmed
diagnosis
of
severe
dengue
at
hospital
admission
.

Thus
,
a
cumulative
score
combining
simple
clinical
parameters
and
first-line
laboratory
findings
could
be
used
to
accurately
predict
dengue
virus
infection
in
pediatric
populations
,
optimizing
triage
in
settings
with
limited
laboratory
resources
.

Dihydropyrimidinase
is
a
member
of
the
cyclic
amidohydrolase
family
,
which
also
includes
allantoinase
,
dihydroorotase
,
hydantoinase
,
and
imidase
.

These
metalloenzymes
possess
very
similar
active
sites
and
may
use
a
similar
mechanism
for
catalysis
.

However
,
whether
the
substrates
and
inhibitors
of
other
cyclic
amidohydrolases
can
inhibit
dihydropyrimidinase
remains
unclear
.

This
study
investigated
the
inhibition
of
dihydropyrimidinase
by
flavonoids
and
substrates
of
other
cyclic
amidohydrolases
.

Allantoin
,
dihydroorotate
,
5hydantoin
acetic
acid
,
acetohydroxamate
,
orotic
acid
,
and
3-amino-1,2,4-triazole
could
slightly
inhibit
dihydropyrimidinase
,
and
the
IC
50
values
of
these
compounds
were
within
the
millimolar
range
.

The
inhibition
of
dihydropyrimidinase
by
flavonoids
,
such
as
myricetin
,
quercetin
,
kaempferol
,
galangin
,
dihydromyricetin
,
and
myricitrin
,
was
also
investigated
.

Some
of
these
compounds
are
known
as
inhibitors
of
allantoinase
and
dihydroorotase
.

Although
the
inhibitory
effects
of
these
flavonoids
on
dihydropyrimidinase
were
substrate-dependent
,
dihydromyricetin
significantly
inhibited
dihydropyrimidinase
with
IC
50
values
of
48
and
40
μM
for
the
substrates
dihydrouracil
and
5-propyl-hydantoin
,
respectively
.

The
results
from
the
Lineweaver−Burk
plot
indicated
that
dihydromyricetin
was
a
competitive
inhibitor
.

Results
from
fluorescence
quenching
analysis
indicated
that
dihydromyricetin
could
form
a
stable
complex
with
dihydropyrimidinase
with
the
K
d
value
of
22.6
μM
.

A
structural
study
using
PatchDock
showed
that
dihydromyricetin
was
docked
in
the
active
site
pocket
of
dihydropyrimidinase
,
which
was
consistent
with
the
findings
from
kinetic
and
fluorescence
studies
.

This
study
was
the
first
to
demonstrate
that
naturally
occurring
product
dihydromyricetin
inhibited
dihydropyrimidinase
,
even
more
than
the
substrate
analogs
(
>
3
orders
of
magnitude
)
.

These
flavonols
,
particularly
myricetin
,
may
serve
as
drug
leads
and
dirty
drugs
(
for
multiple
targets
)
for
designing
compounds
that
target
several
cyclic
amidohydrolases
.

in
the
second
step
of
the
pyrimidine
degradation
pathway
,
respectively
[
1
,
2
]
.

Dihydropyrimidinase
,
a
component
in
the
chain
of
pyrimidine
catabolism
,
is
also
capable
of
detoxifying
xenobiotics
with
an
imide
functional
group
that
ranges
from
linear
imides
to
heterocyclic
imides
[
3
,
4
,
5
]
and
organic
cyclic
carbonates
[
6
]
.

These
different
imide-hydrolyzing
enzymes
from
microorganisms
are
normally
known
as
hydantoinase
because
of
their
role
as
biocatalysts
in
the
synthesis
of
D-and
L-amino
acids
for
the
industrial
production
of
the
precursors
of
antibiotics
[
7
,
8
]
.

Although
dihydropyrimidinase
and
hydantoinase
generally
have
a
similar
active
site
,
their
overall
sequence
identity
and
substrate
specificity
differ
[
9
]
.

Thus
,
some
bacterial
hydantoinases
are
still
named
and
identified
as
dihydropyrimidinase
because
of
the
catalytic
activity
toward
the
natural
substrates
dihydrouracil
and
dihydrothymine
.

Based
on
their
functional
and
structural
similarities
,
dihydropyrimidinase
,
hydantoinase
,
imidase
,
allantoinase
,
and
dihydroorotase
belong
to
the
cyclic
amidohydrolase
family
[
10
]
.

Even
if
these
enzymes
have
similar
functions
,
they
have
relatively
low
amino
acid
sequence
identity
.

These
metal-dependent
enzymes
catalyze
the
ring-opening
hydrolysis
of
the
cyclic
amide
bond
of
each
substrate
in
either
five-or
six-membered
rings
in
the
metabolism
of
purines
,
pyrimidines
,
and
many
xenobiotics

[

,

,

,

]
.

Almost
all
the
active
sites
of
dihydropyrimidinase
,
hydantoinase
,
allantoinase
,
and
dihydroorotase
contain
four
histidines
,
one
aspartate
,
and
one
post-carboxylated
lysine
residue
,
which
are
required
for
metal
binding
and
catalytic
activity
.

The
presence
of
a
post-carboxylated
lysine
in
hydantoinase
is
also
required
in
binuclear
metal
center
self-assembly
[

]
,
and
it
increases
the
nucleophilicity
of
the
hydroxide
for
catalysis
[
14
]
.

Previous
studies
indicated
that
cyclic
amidohydrolases
should
use
a
nearly
identical
mechanism
for
catalysis
.

However
,
the
substrate
selectivity
and
specificity
of
dihydropyrimidinase
,
hydantoinase
,
allantoinase
,
and
dihydroorotase
highly
differ
.

For
example
,
dihydroorotase
does
not
hydrolyze
dihydropyrimidine
,
hydantoin
,
and
allantoin

Brazil
holds
approximately
1/3
of
population
living
infected
with
AIDS
(
acquired
immunodeficiency
syndrome
)
in
Central
and
South
Americas
,
and
it
was
also
the
first
developing
country
to
implement
a
large-scale
control
and
intervention
program
against
AIDS
epidemic
.

In
this
scenario
,
we
investigate
the
temporal
evolution
and
current
status
of
the
AIDS
epidemic
in
Brazil
.

Specifically
,
we
analyze
records
of
annual
absolute
frequency
of
cases
for
more
than
5000
cities
for
the
first
33
years
of
the
infection
in
Brazil
.

We
found
that
(
i
)
the
annual
absolute
frequencies
exhibit
a
logistic-type
growth
with
an
exponential
regime
in
the
first
few
years
of
the
AIDS
spreading
;

)
the
actual
reproduction
number
decaying
as
a

;
(

)
the
distribution
of
the
annual
absolute
frequencies
among

decays
with
a
power

behavior
;
(

)
the
annual
absolute
frequencies
and
the
number
of
inhabitants
have
an
allometric
relationship
;
(
v
)
the
temporal
evolution
of
the
annual
absolute
frequencies
have
different
profile
depending
on
the
average
annual
absolute
frequencies
in
the
cities
.

These
findings
yield
a
general
quantitative
description
of
the
AIDS
infection
dynamics
in
Brazil
since
the
beginning
.

They
also
provide
clues
about
the
effectiveness
of
treatment
and
control
programs
against
the
infection
,
that
has
had
a
different
impact
depending
on
the
number
of
inhabitants
of
cities
.

In
this
framework
,
our
results
give
insights
into
the
overall
dynamics
of
AIDS
epidemic
,
which
may
contribute
to
select
empirically
accurate
models
.

Without
viral
envelope
proteins
,
viruses
can
not
enter
cells
to
start
infection
.

As
the
major
viral
proteins
present
on
the
surface
of
virions
,
viral
envelope
proteins
are
a
prominent
target
of
the
host
immune
system
in
preventing
and
ultimately
eliminating
viral
infection
.

In
addition
to
the
well-appreciated
adaptive
immunity
that
produces
envelope
protein-specific
antibodies
and
T
cell
responses
,
recent
studies
have
begun
to
unveil
a
rich
layer
of
host
innate
immune
mechanisms
restricting
viral
entry
.

This
review
focuses
on
the
exciting
progress
that
has
been
made
in
this
new
direction
of
research
,
by
discussing
various
known
examples
of
host
restriction
of
viral
entry
,
and
diverse
viral
countering
strategies
,
in
particular
,
the
emerging
role
of
viral
envelope
proteins
in
evading
host
innate
immune
suppression
.

We
will
also
highlight
the
effective
cooperation
between
innate
and
adaptive
immunity
to
achieve
the
synergistic
control
of
viral
infection
by
targeting
viral
envelope
protein
and
checking
viral
escape
.

Given
that
many
of
the
related
findings
were
made
with
HIV-1
,
we
will
use
HIV-1
as
the
model
virus
to
illustrate
the
basic
principles
and
molecular
mechanisms
on
host
restriction
targeting
HIV-1

The
continued
spread
of
highly
pathogenic
avian
influenza
(
HPAI
)
H5N1
virus
underscores
the
importance
of
effective
antiviral
approaches
.

AVFluIgG01
is
a
potent
and
broad-reactive
H5N1-neutralizing
human
monoclonal
antibody
(
mAb
)
showing
great
potential
for
use
either
for
therapeutic
purposes
or
as
a
basis
of
vaccine
development
,
but
its
antigenic
epitope
and
neutralization
mechanism
have
not
been
finely
characterized
.

In
this
study
,
we
first
demonstrated
that
AVFluIgG01
targets
a
novel
conformation-dependent
epitope
in
the
globular
head
region
of
H5N1
hemagglutinin
(
HA
)
.

By
selecting
mimotopes
from
a
random
peptide
library
in
combination
with
computational
algorithms
and
site-directed
mutagenesis
,
the
epitope
was
mapped
to
three
conserved
discontinuous
sites
(
I-III
)
that
are
located
closely
at
the
threedimensional
structure
of
HA
.

Further
,
we
found
that
this
HA1-specific
human
mAb
can
efficiently
block
both
virus-receptor
binding
and
post-attachment
steps
,
while
its
Fab
fragment
exerts
the
post-attachment
inhibition
only
.

Consistently
,
AVFluIgG01
could
inhibit
HA-mediated
cell-cell
membrane
fusion
at
a
dose-dependent
manner
and
block
the
acquisition
of
pH-induced
protease
sensitivity
.

These
results
suggest
a
neutralization
mechanism
of
AVFluIgG01
by
simultaneously
blocking
viral
attachment
to
the
receptors
on
host
cells
and
interfering
with
HA
conformational
rearrangements
associated
with
membrane
fusion
.

The
presented
data
provide
critical
information
for
developing
novel
antiviral
therapeutics
and
vaccines
against

H5N1
virus
.

Background
:
Human
bocavirus
(
HBoV
)
is
a
recently
discovered
parvovirus
associated
with
mild
to
severe
lower
respiratory
tract
infections
in
children
,
the
aim
of
the
work
was
determination
of
human
bocavirus
in
nasopharyngeal
aspirate
(
NPA
)
of
infants
by
qualitative
PCR
and
determination
of
acute
human
bocavirus
infection
by
estimation
of
immunoglobulin
M
(
IgM
)
antibodies
in
serum
by
enzyme
linked
immunosorbent
assay
.

Results
:
Twenty
two
(
22
%
)
out
of
the
100
NPA
specimens
of
the
patients
with
respiratory
manifestations
were
positive
for
HBoV
by
qualitative
PCR
,
while
ELISA
revealed
positive
HBoV
IgM
antibodies
in
18
(
18
%
)
patients
who
were
also
positive
by
PCR
.

Non
of
the
controls
were
positive
by
both
techniques
.

The
correlation
study
between
ELISA
and

revealed
high
significant
association
,

.

Also
PCR
detected
4
(
18.1

)
NPA
samples
as
HBoV
positive
cases
among
the
patients
that
were
not
identified
by
ELISA
.

This
could
be
due
to
high
sensitivity
and
efficacy
of
PCR
.

ELISA
being
less
sensitive
than
RT-PCR
,
sensitivity
was
(
81.8
%
vs
100
%
)
,
the
efficacy
was
97.7
%
in
ELISA
versus
99.7
%
for
RT-PCR
.

Conclusion
:
HBoV
infections
could
be
diagnosed
in
NPA
of
children
by
conventional
PCR
as
a
rapid
and
sensitive
technique
.

While
ELISA
was
a
reliable
serologic
analysis
for
diagnosis
of
acute
HBoV
infection
by
estimation

Methods
:
Using

prodrug
of
2'fluoro-2'-C-methylguanosine-5'-monophosphate
that
has
potent
in

activity
against

The

of
AT-511
,
determined
using
HCV
laboratory
strains
and
clinical
isolates
with
genotypes
1-5
,
ranged
from
5-28
nM
.

The
active
5'-triphosphate
metabolite
,
AT-9010
,
specifically
inhibited
the
HCV
RNA-dependent
RNA
polymerase
.

AT-511
did
not
inhibit
the
replication
of
other
selected
RNA
or
DNA
viruses
in

.

AT-511
was
approximately
10-fold
more
active
than
sofosbuvir
(
SOF
)
against
a
panel
of
laboratory
strains
and
clinical
isolates
of
HCV
genotypes
1-5
and
remained
fully
active
against
S282T
resistance-associated
variants
,
with
up
to
58-fold
more
potency
than
SOF
.

In

,
AT-511
did
not
inhibit
human
DNA
polymerases
or
elicit
cytotoxicity
or
mitochondrial
toxicity
at
concentrations
up
to

bases
were
formed
when
incubated
with
cytochrome
P450

CYP
)
3A4
,
and
AT-511
had
IC
50
values

μM
against
a
panel
of
CYP
enzymes
.

In
hepatocytes
from
multiple
species
,
the
active
triphosphate
was
the
predominant
metabolite
produced
from
the
prodrug
,
with
a
half-life
of
10
h
in
human
hepatocytes
.

When
given
orally
to
rats

,
AT-527
preferentially
delivered
high
levels
of
AT-9010
in
the
liver
in

.

These
favorable
preclinical
attributes
support
the
ongoing
clinical
development
of
AT-527
and
suggest
that
,
when
used
in
combination
with
an
HCV
DAA
from
a
different
class
,
AT-527
may
increase
SVR
rates
,
especially
for
difficult-to-treat

The
potential
involvement
of
viruses
in
inflammatory

)
was
previously
investigated
through
either
serology
or
PCR
from

.

The
aims
of
this

were
to
determine
the
prevalence
and

quantification
of
EHV-2
and
ERBV
by
qPCR
in

There
was
a
significant
positive
correlation
between
the
knowledge
score
of
warning
signs
and
level
of
confidence
in
detecting
a
warning
sign
.

Socio-demographic
characteristics
and
having
cancer

play
important
role
in

of
awareness
.

Conclusions
:
Level
of
awareness
on
colorectal
cancer
warning
signs
and
risk
factors
in
the
rural
population
of
Malaysia
is
very
low
.

Therefore
,
it
warrants
an
extensive
health
education
campaign
on
colorectal
cancer
awareness
as
it
is
one
of
the
commonest
cancer
in
Malaysia
.

Health
education
campaign
is
urgently
needed
because
respondents
would
seek
medical
attention
sooner
if
they
are
aware
of
this
problem
.

The
discovery
of
the
interferon-lambda
(
IFN-λ
)
family
has
considerably
contributed
to
our
understanding
of
the
role
of
interferon
not
only
in
viral
infections
but
also
in
cancer
.

IFN-λ
proteins
belong
to
the
new
type
III
IFN
group
.

Type
III
IFN
is
structurally
similar
to
type
II
IFN
(
IFN-γ
)
but
functionally
identical
to
type
I
IFN
(
IFN-α/β
)
.

However
,
in
contrast
to
type
I
or
type
II
IFNs
,
the
response
to
type
III
IFN
is
highly
cell-type
specific
.

Only
epithelial-like
cells
and
to
a
lesser
extent
some
immune
cells
respond
to
IFN-λ
.

This
particular
pattern
of
response
is
controlled
by
the
differential
expression
of
the
IFN-λ
receptor
,
which
,
in
contrast
to
IFN-α
,
should
result
in
limited
side
effects
in
patients
.

Recently
,
we
and
other
groups
have
shown
in
several
animal
models
a
potent
antitumor
role
of
IFN-λ
that
will
open
a
new
challenging
era
for
the
current
IFN
therapy
.

Biological
Properties
of
IFN-λ
Although
type
I
and
type
III
induced
similar
cell
signaling
,

As
recently
pointed
out
by
the
Institute
of
Medicine
,
the
existing
pandemic
mitigation
models
lack
the
dynamic
decision
support
capability
.

We
develop
a
large-scale
simulation-driven
optimization
model
for
generating
dynamic
predictive
distribution
of
vaccines
and
antivirals
over
a
network
of
regional
pandemic
outbreaks
.

The
model
incorporates
measures
of
morbidity
,
mortality
,
and
social
distancing
,
translated
into
the
cost
of
lost
productivity
and
medical
expenses
.

The
performance
of
the
strategy
is
compared
to
that
of
the
reactive
myopic
policy
,
using
a
sample
outbreak
in
Fla
,
USA
,
with
an
affected
population
of
over
four
millions
.

The
comparison
is
implemented
at
different
levels
of
vaccine
and
antiviral
availability
and
administration
capacity
.

Sensitivity
analysis
is
performed
to
assess
the
impact
of
variability
of
some
critical
factors
on
policy
performance
.

The
model
is
intended
to
support
public
health
policy
making
for
effective
distribution
of
limited
mitigation
resources

,
nairoviruses
and

.

It
has
not
been
determined
which
Bunyavirus
protein
mediates
virion

beta

with
an
internal
fusion
peptide
located
at
the
end
of

Proteomics

encoded
by

Similar

Gc
encoded
by
members
of
each
Bunyavirus
genus
share
several
sequence
and
structural
motifs
.

These
results
suggest
that
Gc
of
Bunyaviridae
,
and
similar
proteins
of
Tenuiviruses
and
a

,
are
class

Comparisons

Like
all
coronaviruses
,
avian
infectious
bronchitis
virus
(
IBV
)
possesses
a
long
,
single-stranded
,
positive-sense
RNA
genome
(
ϳ27
kb
)
and
has
a
complex
replication
strategy
that
includes
the
production
of
a
nested
set
of
subgenomic
mRNAs
(
sgmRNAs
)
.

Here
,
we
used
whole-transcriptome
sequencing
(
RNASeq
)
and
ribosome
profiling
(
RiboSeq
)
to
delineate
gene
expression
in
the
IBV
M41-CK
and
Beau-R
strains
at
subcodon
resolution
.

RNASeq
facilitated
a
comparative
analysis
of
viral
RNA
synthesis
and
revealed
two
novel
transcription
junction
sites
in
the
attenuated
Beau-R
strain
,
one
of
which
would
generate
a
sgmRNA
encoding
a
ribosomally
occupied
open
reading
frame
(
dORF
)
located
downstream
of
the
nucleocapsid
coding
region
.

RiboSeq
permitted
quantification
of
the
translational
efficiency
of
virus
gene
expression
and
identified
,
for
the
first
time
,
sites
of
ribosomal
pausing
on
the
genome
.

Quantification
of
reads
flanking
the
programmed
ribosomal
frameshifting
(
PRF
)
signal
at
the
genomic
RNA
ORF1a/ORF1b
junction
revealed
that
PRF
in
IBV
is
highly
efficient
(
33
to
40
%
)
.

Triplet
phasing
of
RiboSeq
data
allowed
precise
determination
of
reading
frames
and
revealed
the
translation
of
two
ORFs
(
ORF4b
and
ORF4c
on
sgmRNA
IR
)
,
which
are
widely
conserved
across
IBV
isolates
.

Analysis
of
differential
gene
expression
in
infected
primary
chick
kidney
cells
indicated
that
the
host
cell
response
to
IBV
occurs
primarily
at
the
level
of
transcription
,
with
global
upregulation
of
immune-related
mRNA
transcripts
following
infection
and
comparatively
modest
changes
in
the
translation
efficiencies
of
host
genes
.

Cellular
genes
and
gene
networks
differentially
expressed
during
virus
infection
were
also
identified
,
giving
insights
into
the
host
cell
response
to
IBV
infection
.

IMPORTANCE
IBV
is
a
major
avian
pathogen
and
presents
a
substantial
economic
burden
to
the
poultry
industry
.

Improved
vaccination
strategies
are
urgently
needed
to
curb
the
global
spread
of
this
virus
,
and
the
development
of
suitable
vaccine
candidates
will
be
aided
by
an
improved
understanding
of
IBV
molecular
biology
.

Our
high-resolution
data
have
enabled
a
precise
study
of
transcription
and
translation
in
cells
infected
with
both
pathogenic
and
attenuated
forms
of
IBV
and
expand
our
understanding
of
gammacoronaviral
gene
expression
.

We
demonstrate
that
gene
expression
shows
considerable
intraspecies
variation
,
with
single
nucleotide
polymorphisms
being
associated
with
altered
production
of
sgmRNA
transcripts
,
and
our
Ri-boSeq
data
sets
enabled
us
to
uncover
novel
ribosomally
occupied
ORFs
in
both
strains
.

The
numerous
cellular
genes
and
gene
networks
found
to
be
differentially
expressed
during
virus
infection
provide
insights
into
the
host
cell
response
to
IBV
infection
.

(
family
Coronaviridae
,
order
Nidovirales
)
and
a
pathogen
of
domestic
fowl
(

)
.

IBV
infects
primarily
the
epithelial
cells
of
upper
and
lower
respiratory
tract
tissues
,
though
infections
can
also
spread
to
the
alimentary
canal
,
as
well
as
to
the
kidneys
,
testes
,
and
oviduct
(
2
)
.

The
monopartite
,
polycistronic
genomic
RNA
(
gRNA
)
of
IBV
is
approximately
27
kb
in
length
,
and
like
the
gRNAs
of
other
coronaviruses
,
it
is
5=
methyl
capped
and
3=
polyadenylated
(
3
)
.

Two
large
open
reading
frames
(
ORFs
)
-ORF1a
and
ORF1b-are
situated
within
the
5=
proximal
two-thirds
of
the
genome
.

Translation
of
the
former
yields
a
ca
.

3,950-amino-acid
(
aa
)
polyprotein
(
pp1a
)
,
whereas
translation
of
the
latter
requires
Ϫ1
programmed
ribosomal
frameshifting
(
PRF
)
(
4
,
5
)
,
giving
rise
to
a
ca
.

6,630-aa
polyprotein
(
pp1ab
)
.

These
polyproteins
are
cleaved
to
yield
the
components
of
the
membrane-bound
replication-transcription
complex
(
RTC
)
(
6-8
)
.

A
feature
of
coronavirus
replication
is
the
synthesis
of
a
nested
,
3=-coterminal
set
of
subgenomic
mRNAs
(
sgmRNAs
)
encoding
the
viral
structural
and
accessory
proteins
.

The
5=
end
of
each
sgmRNA
comprises
a
56-nucleotide
(
nt
)
sequence
derived
from
the
5=
end
of
the
genome
,
the
so-called
leader
sequence
(
9
,
10
)
.

Incorporation
of
the
leader
occurs
as
a
result
of
polymerase
hopping-or
discontinuous
transcription-during
negativestrand
synthesis
.

When
the
RTC
encounters
specific
body
transcription
regulatory
sequences
(
TRS-Bs
)
,
the
nascent
negative
strand
can
re-pair
with
a
closely
homologous
leader
TRS
(
TRS-L
)
at
the
3=
end
of
the
leader
,
after
which
the
viral
polymerase
completes
negative-strand
synthesis
using
the
leader
as
the
template
(
Fig
.

1A
,
diamond
symbols
)
(
8-14
)
.

Subsequently
,
the
RTC
synthesizes
positive-strand
copies
of
the
negative-strand
genomic
and
sgmRNAs
.

Among
the
best-characterized
strains
of
IBV
are
those
belonging
to
the
Massachusetts
serotype
,
which
includes
the
virulent
Massachusetts
41
(
M41-CK
)
(
15
)
isolate
and
the
laboratory-attenuated
Beau-R
variant
(
16
)
.

While
M41-CK
is
restricted
to
growth
in
primary
chicken
cells
,
Beau-R
is
capable
of
replicating
in
both
avian
and
nonavian
cell
lines
,
including
Vero
(
African
green
monkey
kidney-derived
)
and
baby
hamster
kidney
cells

Polymorphisms
in
the
spike
(
S
)
glycoprotein
subunit
2
(
S2
)
,
which
spans
the
viral
membrane
,
have
been
shown
to
be
responsible
for
this
variation
in
host
cell
tropism
(
21
)
.

Moreover
,
the
S
protein
of
M41-CK-but
not
that
of
Beau-R-elicits
an
immunoprotective
response
in
vivo
,
although
recombinant
transfer
of
the
protein
from
the
former
to
the
latter
does
not
restore
pathogenicity
(
22
)
.

The
extent
to
which
these
strains
diverge
in
terms
of
virus
gene
expression
or
in
terms
of
host
cell
gene
expression
in
response
to
infection
has
not
been
investigated
in
detail
.

The
advent
of
high-throughput
sequencing
techniques
offers
a
means
to
monitor
viral
gene
expression
at
unprecedented
resolution
(
23-27
)
.

Here
,
we
performed
deep

,

.

An
average
of
1,156,819

were
mapped

the
virus-infected

The

in
the

derived
from
the
second
biological
repeat
of
M41-CK-infected
cells
was
lower
than
that
in
the
other
libraries
due
to
technical
losses
.

However
,
106,741
reads
were
mapped
to
the
forward
strand
of
the
viral
gRNA
in
this
case
,
corresponding
to
a
coverage

approximately
3.8-fold
,
and
these
reads
were
generally
evenly
distributed
along
the
gRNA

hence
,
the

can
be
implemented
for
a

to
that
in

We
consider
a
hospital
ward
with
six
rooms
with
patients
allocated
across
these
rooms
in
an
asymmetrical
way
.

In
particular
,
rooms
1
,

and

contain
one
patient
each
,
while
rooms

,

contain
three
patients

.

We
consider
a
number
of
ventilation
settings
(

,
SB
,

and

)
,
and
carry

explore
how
airflow
dynamics
interplay
with
other
factors
related
to
infection
spread
,
such
as
outbreak

.

The
main
aim
is
:
(

)
to
show
how
our
methodology
can
easily
be
extended
to
any
hospital
ward
structure
by
appropriately
modifying
the

to
show
how
,
while
some
of
our
conclusions
in
[

]
seem
to
be
valid
also
for
the
hospital
ward
structure
considered
in
this
supplementary
material
,
others
might
highly
depend
on
the
particular

.

Mutation
and
adaptation
have
driven
the
co-evolution
of
coronaviruses
(
CoVs
)
and
their
hosts
,
including
human
beings
,
for
thousands
of
years
.

Before
2003
,
two
human
CoVs
(
HCoVs
)
were
known
to
cause
mild
illness
,
such
as
common
cold
.

The
outbreaks
of
severe
acute
respiratory
syndrome
(
SARS
)
and
the
Middle
East
respiratory
syndrome
(
MERS
)
have
flipped
the
coin
to
reveal
how
devastating
and
lifethreatening
an
HCoV
infection
could
be
.

The
emergence
of
SARS-CoV-2
in
central
China
at
the
end
of
2019
has
thrusted
CoVs
into
the
spotlight
again
and
surprised
us
with
its
high
transmissibility
but
reduced
pathogenicity
compared
to
its
sister
SARS-CoV
.

HCoV
infection
is
a
zoonosis
and
understanding
the
zoonotic
origins
of
HCoVs
would
serve
us
well
.

Most
HCoVs
originated
from
bats
where
they
are
non-pathogenic
.

The
intermediate
reservoir
hosts
of
some
HCoVs
are
also
known
.

Identifying
the
animal
hosts
has
direct
implications
in
the
prevention
of
human
diseases
.

Investigating
CoV-host
interactions
in
animals
might
also
derive
important
insight
on
CoV
pathogenesis
in
humans
.

In
this
review
,
we
present
an
overview
of
the
existing
knowledge
about
the
seven
HCoVs
,
with
a
focus
on
the
history
of
their
discovery
as
well
as
their
zoonotic
origins
and
interspecies
transmission
.

Importantly
,
we
compare
and
contrast
the
different
HCoVs
from
a
perspective
of
virus
evolution
and
genome
recombination
.

The
current
CoV
disease
2019
(
COVID-19
)
epidemic
is
discussed
in
this
context
.

In
addition
,
the
requirements
for
successful
host
switches
and
the
implications
of
virus
evolution
on
disease
severity
are
also
highlighted
.

Demyelination
in
the
central
nervous
system
induced
by
neurovirulent
strains
of
Mouse
Hepatitis
Virus
(
MHV
)
is
mediated
by
the
viral
spike
glycoprotein
,
but
it
is
not
clear
whether
the
mechanism
of
this
disease
pathology
involves
direct
viral
infection
of
oligodendrocytes
.

Detailed
studies
of
glial
cell
tropism
of
MHV
are
presented
,
demonstrating
that
direct
MHV
infection
of
oligodendrocytes
differs
between
demyelinating
(
RSA59
)
and
non-demyelinating
(
RSMHV2
)
viral
strains
both
in
vitro
and
in
vivo
.

Our
results
indicate
that
direct
injury
of
mature
oligodendrocytes
is
an
important
mechanism
of
virus-induced
demyelination
.

In
vivo
,
RSA59
infection
was
identified
in
spinal
cord
gray
and
white
matter
,
but
infected
oligodendrocytes
were
restricted
to
white
matter
.

In
contrast
,
RSMHV2
infection
was
restricted
to
gray
matter
neurons
and
was
not
localized
to
oligodendrocytes
.

In
vitro
,
RSA59
can
infect
both
oligodendrocyte
precursors
and
differentiated
oligodendrocytes
,
whereas
RSMHV2
can
infect
oligodendrocyte
precursors
but
not
differentiated
oligodendrocytes
.

Viral
spreading
through
axonal
means
to
white
matter
and
release
of
the
demyelinating
strain
MHV
at
the
nerve
end
is
critical
for
oligodendrocytes
infection
and
subsequent
demyelination
.

Understanding
the
mechanisms
by
which
known
viruses
effect
demyelination
in
this
animal
model
has
important
therapeutic
implications
in
the
treatment
of
human
demyelinating
disease
.

Although
this

constitutes
a
plausible

in

,
there
are

Introduction
:
Media
sensationalism
on
the
H1N1
outbreak
may
have
influenced
decisional
processes
and
clinical
diagnosis
.

Case
Presentation
:
We
report
two
cases
of
patients
who
presented
in
2009
with
coexisting
H1N1
virus
and
Legionella
infections
:
a
69-year-old
Caucasian
man
and
a
71-year-old
Caucasian
woman
.

In
our
cases
all
the
signs
and
symptoms
,
including
vomiting
,
progressive
respiratory
disease
leading
to
respiratory
failure
,
refractory
hypoxemia
,
leukopenia
,
lymphopenia
,
thrombocytopenia
,
and
elevated
levels
of
creatine
kinase
and
hepatic
aminotransferases
,
were
consistent
with
critical
illness
due
to
2009
H1N1
virus
infection
.

Other
infectious
disorders
may
mimic
H1N1
viral
infection
especially
Legionnaires
'
disease
.

Because
the
swine
flu
H1N1
pandemic
occurred
in
Autumn
in
Italy
,
Legionnaires
disease
was
to
be
highly
suspected
since
the
peak
incidence
usually
occurs
in
early
fall
.

We
do
think
that
our
immediate
suspicion
of
Legionella
infection
based
on
clinical
history
and
X-ray
abnormalities
was
fundamental
for
a
successful
resolution
.

Conclusion
:
Our
two
case
reports
suggest
that
patients
with
H1N1
should
be
screened
for
Legionella
,
which
is
not
currently
common
practice
.

This
is
particularly
important
since
the
signs
and
symptoms
of
both
infections
are
similar
.

Dengue
is
usually
diagnosed
by
isolation
of
the
virus
,
serology
or
molecular
diagnostic
methods
.

Several
commercial
kits
for
the
diagnosis
of
dengue
are
existing
,
but
concerns
have
arisen
regarding
to
the
affordability
and
performance
characteristics
of
these
kits
.

Hence
,
the
loop-mediated
isothermal
amplification
(
LAMP
)
is
potentially
ideal
to
be
used
especially
in
resource
limited
environments
.

Serum
was
collected
from
healthy
donors
and
patients
diagnosed
with
dengue
infection
.

RNA
extracted
from
the
serum
samples
were
tested
by
reverse-transcription-LAMP
assay
developed
based
on
3
0
-NCR
gene
sequences
for
DENV
1-4
.

Results
were
interpreted
by
a
turbidity
meter
in
real
time
or
visually
at
the
end
of
the
assay
.

Sensitivity
and
specificity
of
RT-LAMP
results
were
calculated
and
compared
to
qRT-PCR
and
ELISA
.

RT-LAMP
is
highly
sensitive
with
the
detection
limit
of
10
RNA
copies
for
all
serotypes
.

Dengue
virus
RNA
was
detected
in
all
positive
samples
using
RT-LAMP
and
none
of
the
negative
samples
within
30-45
minutes
.

With
continuing
efforts
in
the
optimization
of
this
assay
,
RT-LAMP
may
provide
a
simple
and
reliable
test
for
detecting
DENV
in
areas
where
dengue
is
prevalent
.

Background
:
Porcine
epidemic
diarrhea
virus
(
PEDV
)
,
which
is
characterized
by
severe
watery
diarrhea
,
vomiting
,
dehydration
and
a
high
mortality
rate
in
piglets
,
leads
to
enormous
economic
losses
to
the
pork
industry
and
remains
a
large
challenge
worldwide
.

Thus
,
a
rapid
and
reliable
method
is
required
for
epidemiological
investigations
and
to
evaluate
the
effect
of
immunization
.

However
,
the
current
diagnostic
methods
for
PEDV
are
time-consuming
and
very
expensive
and
rarely
meet
the
requirements
for
clinical
application
.

Nanobodies
have
been
used
in
the
clinic
to
overcome
these
problems
because
of
the
advantages
of
their
easy
expression
and
high
level
of
stability
.

In
the
present
work
,
a
novel
biotinylated
nanobody-based
blocking
ELISA
(
bELISA
)
was
developed
to
detect
anti-PEDV
antibodies
in
clinical
pig
serum
.

Results
:
Using
phage
display
technology
and
periplasmic
extraction
ELISA
(
PE-ELISA
)
,
anti-PEDV
N
protein
nanobodies
from
three
strains
of
PEDV
were
successfully
isolated
after
three
consecutive
rounds
of
bio-panning
from
a
high
quality
phage
display
VHH
library
.

Then
,
purified
Nb2-Avi-tag
fusion
protein
was
biotinylated
in
vitro
.

A
novel
bELISA
was
subsequently
developed
for
the
first
time
with
biotinylated
Nb2
.

The
cutoff
value
for
bELISA
was
29.27
%
.

One
hundred
and
fifty
clinical
serum
samples
were
tested
by
both
newly
developed
bELISA
and
commercial
kits
.

The
sensitivity
and
specificity
of
bELISA
were
100
%
and
93.18
%
,
respectively
,
and
the
coincidence
rate
between
the
two
methods
was
94
%
.

In
brief
,
bELISA
is
a
rapid
,
low-cost
,
reliable
and
useful
nanobody-based
tool
for
the
serological
evaluation
of
current
PEDV
vaccines
efficacy
and
indirect
diagnosis
of
PEDV
infection
.

Airborne-mediated
microbial
diseases
such
as
influenza
and
tuberculosis
represent
major
public
health
challenges
.

A
direct
approach
to
prevent
airborne
transmission
is
inactivation
of
airborne
pathogens
,
and
the
airborne
antimicrobial
potential
of
UVC
ultraviolet
light
has
long
been
established
;
however
,
its
widespread
use
in
public
settings
is
limited
because
conventional
UVC
light
sources
are
both
carcinogenic
and
cataractogenic
.

By
contrast
,
we
have
previously
shown
that
far-UVC
light
(
207-222
nm
)
efficiently
inactivates
bacteria
without
harm
to
exposed
mammalian
skin
.

This
is
because
,
due
to
its
strong
absorbance
in
biological
materials
,
far-UVC
light
can
not
penetrate
even
the
outer
(
non
living
)
layers
of
human
skin
or
eye
;
however
,
because
bacteria
and
viruses
are
of
micrometer
or
smaller
dimensions
,
far-UVC
can
penetrate
and
inactivate
them
.

We
show
for
the
first
time
that
far-UVC
efficiently
inactivates
airborne
aerosolized
viruses
,
with
a
very
low
dose
of
2
mJ/cm

of
222-nm
light
inactivating

Continuous
very
low
dose-rate
far-UVC
light
in
indoor
public
locations
is
a
promising
,
safe
and
inexpensive
tool
to
reduce
the
spread
of
airbornemediated
microbial
diseases
.

Airborne-mediated
microbial
diseases
represent
one
of
the
major
challenges
to
worldwide
public
health
1
.

Common
examples
are
influenza
2
,
appearing
in
seasonal
3
and
pandemic
4
forms
,
and
bacterially-based
airborne-mediated
diseases
such
as
tuberculosis
5
,
increasingly
emerging
in
multi-drug
resistant
form
.

A
direct
approach
to
prevent
the
transmission
of
airborne-mediated
disease
is
inactivation
of
the
corresponding
airborne
pathogens
,
and
in
fact
the
airborne
antimicrobial
efficacy
of
ultraviolet
(
UV
)
light
has
long
been
established
6-8
.

Germicidal
UV
light
can
also
efficiently
inactivate
both
drug-sensitive
and
multi-drug-resistant
bacteria
9
,
as
well
as
differing
strains
of
viruses
10
.

However
,
the
widespread
use
of
germicidal
ultraviolet
light
in
public
settings
has
been
very
limited
because
conventional
UVC
light
sources
are
a
human
health
hazard
,
being
both
carcinogenic
and
cataractogenic
11,12
.

By
contrast
,
we
have
earlier
shown
that
far-UVC
light
generated
by
filtered
excimer
lamps
emitting
in
the
207
to
222
nm
wavelength
range
,
efficiently
inactivates
drug-resistant
bacteria
,
without
apparent
harm
to
exposed
mammalian
skin
[
13
]
[
14
]
[
15
]
.

The
biophysical
reason
is
that
,
due
to
its
strong
absorbance
in
biological
materials
,
far-UVC
light
does
not
have
sufficient
range
to
penetrate
through
even
the
outer
layer
(
stratum
corneum
)
on
the
surface
of
human
skin
,
nor
the
outer
tear
layer
on
the
outer
surface
of
the
eye
,
neither
of
which
contain
living
cells
;
however
,
because
bacteria
and
viruses
are
typically
of
micron
or
smaller
dimensions
,
far-UVC
light
can
still
efficiently
traverse
and
inactivate
them
[
13
]
[
14
]
[
15
]
.

The
earlier
studies
on
the
germicidal
efficacy
of
far
UVC
light
13,15-18
were
performed
exposing
bacteria
irradiated
on
a
surface
or
in
suspension
.

In
that
a
major
pathway

we
investigate
for
the
first
time
the
efficacy
of
far-UVC
222-nm
light
for
inactivating
airborne
viruses
carried
by
aerosols
-with
the
goal
of
providing
a
potentially
safe
alternative
to
conventional

germicidal
lamps
to
inactivate
airborne
microbes

is
critical
for

We
hypothesized
that
oral
VA
supplementation
of
porcine
epidemic
diarrhea
virus
(
PEDV
)
infected
pregnant
gilts
would
enhance
the
gut-mammary
gland-secretory
IgA
axis
to
boost
lactogenic
immunity
and
passive
protection
of
nursing
piglets
against
PEDV
challenge
.

Gilts
received
daily
oral
retinyl
acetate
(
30
000
IU
)
starting
at
gestation
day
76
throughout
lactation
.

At
3-4
weeks
pre-partum
,
VA-supplemented
(
PEDV
+
VA
)
and
non-supplemented
(
PEDV
)
gilts
were
PEDV
or
mock
inoculated
(
mock
+
VA
and
mock
,
respectively
)
.

PEDV
+
VA
gilts
had
decreased
mean
PEDV
RNA
shedding
titers
and
diarrhea
scores
.

To
determine
if
lactogenic
immunity
correlated
with
protection
,
all
piglets
were
PEDV-challenged
at
3-5
days
post-partum
.

The
survival
rate
of
PEDV
+
VA
litters
was
74.2
%
compared
with
55.9
%
in
PEDV
litters
.

Mock
and
mock
+
VA
litter
survival
rates
were
5.7
%
and
8.3
%
,
respectively
.

PEDV
+
VA
gilts
had
increased
PEDV
IgA
antibody
secreting
cells
and
PEDV
IgA
antibodies
in
serum
pre-partum

)
cells
in
milk
post
piglet
challenge
compared

.

Our
findings
suggest
that
oral
VA
supplementation
may
act
as
an
adjuvant
during
pregnancy
,
enhancing
maternal
IgA
and
lactogenic
immune
protection
in
nursing
piglets
.

Background
:
The
electronic
medical
record
(
EMR
)
contains
a
rich
source
of
information
that
could
be
harnessed
for
epidemic
surveillance
.

We
asked
if
structured
EMR
data
could
be
coupled
with
computerized
processing
of
free-text
clinical
entries
to
enhance
detection
of
acute
respiratory
infections
(
ARI
)
.

Methodology
:
A
manual
review
of
EMR
records
related
to
15,377
outpatient
visits
uncovered
280
reference
cases
of
ARI
.

We
used
logistic
regression
with
backward
elimination
to
determine
which
among
candidate
structured
EMR
parameters
(
diagnostic
codes
,
vital
signs
and
orders
for
tests
,
imaging
and
medications
)
contributed
to
the
detection
of
those
reference
cases
.

We
also
developed
a
computerized
free-text
search
to
identify
clinical
notes
documenting
at
least
two
non-negated
ARI
symptoms
.

We
then
used
heuristics
to
build
case-detection
algorithms
that
best
combined
the
retained
structured
EMR
parameters
with
the
results
of
the
text
analysis
.

Principal
Findings
:
An
adjusted
grouping
of
diagnostic
codes
identified
reference
ARI
patients
with
a
sensitivity
of
79
%
,
a
specificity
of
96
%
and
a
positive
predictive
value
(
PPV
)
of
32
%
.

Of
the
21
additional
structured
clinical
parameters
considered
,
two
contributed
significantly
to
ARI
detection
:
new
prescriptions
for
cough
remedies
and
elevations
in
body
temperature
to
at
least
38uC
.

Together
with
the
diagnostic
codes
,
these
parameters
increased
detection
sensitivity
to
87
%
,
but
specificity
and
PPV
declined
to
95
%
and
25
%
,
respectively
.

Adding
text
analysis
increased
sensitivity
to
99
%
,
but
PPV
dropped
further
to
14
%
.

Algorithms
that
required
satisfying
both
a
query
of
structured
EMR
parameters
as
well
as
text
analysis
disclosed
PPVs
of
52-68
%
and
retained
sensitivities
of
69-73
%
.

Conclusion
:
Structured
EMR
parameters
and
free-text
analyses
can
be
combined
into
algorithms
that
can
detect
ARI
cases
with
new
levels
of
sensitivity
or
precision
.

These
results
highlight
potential
paths
by
which
repurposed
EMR
information
could
facilitate
the
discovery
of
epidemics
before
they
cause
mass
casualties
.

The
unique
ability
of
bats
to
act
as
reservoir
for
viruses
that
are
highly
pathogenic
to
humans
suggests
unique
properties
and
functional
characteristics
of
their
immune
system
.

However
,
the
lack
of
bat
specific
reagents
,
in
particular
antibodies
,
has
limited
our
knowledge
of
bat
's
immunity
.

Using
crossreactive
antibodies
,
we
report
the
phenotypic
and
functional
characterization
of
T
cell
subsets
,
B
and
NK
cells
in
the
fruit-eating
bat
Pteropus
alecto
.

Our
findings
indicate
the
predominance
of
CD8
+
T
cells
in
the
spleen
from
wild-caught
bats
that
may
reflect
either
the
presence
of
viruses
in
this
organ
or
predominance
of
this
cell
subset
at
steady
state
.

Instead
majority
of
T
cells
in
circulation
,
lymph
nodes
and
bone
marrow
(
BM
)
were
CD4
+
subsets
.

Interestingly
,
40
%
of
spleen
T
cells
expressed
constitutively
IL-17
,
IL-22
and
TGF-β
mRNA
,
which
may
indicate
a
strong
bias
towards
the
Th17
and
regulatory
T
cell
subsets
.

Furthermore
,
the
unexpected
high
number
of
T
cells
in
bats
BM
could
suggest
an
important
role
in
T
cell
development
.

Finally
,
mitogenic
stimulation
induced
proliferation
and
production
of
effector
molecules
by
bats
immune
cells
.

This
work
contributes
to
a
better
understanding
of
bat
's
immunity
,
opening
up
new
perspectives
of
therapeutic
interventions
for
humans
.

In
recent
years
bats
have
been
recognized
as
important
reservoirs
of
highly
pathogenic
viruses
for
human
and
other
animals
such
as
SARS
coronavirus
,
Hendra
,
and
Nipah
viruses
1,2
.

Bats
have
also
been
proposed
as
potential
reservoir
for
Ebola
3
and
MERS
4
,
although
direct
evidence
is
still
lacking
.

How
do
bats
cope
with
viruses
that
have
a
high
mortality
rate
in
humans
without
getting
sick
?

How
have
they
evolved
to
co-exist
with
such
viruses
?

Understanding
the
bats
immune
system
should
help
address
this
question
and
might
open
a
door
to
new
therapeutic
interventions
for
humans
.

Immunity
in
mammals
comprises
two
main
arms
,
namely
the
innate
and
the
adaptive
immunity
,
that
interact
with
each
other
to
generate
optimal
responses
against
pathogens
.

The
innate
immunity
provides
immediate
nonspecific
host
defenses
and
is
highly
conserved
among
species
;
whereas
the
adaptive
immunity
is
restricted
to
higher
organisms
and
involves
antigen-specific
T
and
B
cells
5
.

Pathogen-derived
antigens
are
presented
by
antigen
presenting
cells
(
APC
)
such
as
macrophages
and
dendritic
cells
(
DC
)
to
antigen-specific
T
and
B
cells
in
secondary
lymphoid
organs
such
as
lymph
nodes
,
spleen
and
various
mucosa-associated
lymphoid
tissues
(
MALT
)
6
.

The
antigen-specific
T
or
B
cells
get
then
activated
,
proliferate
and
migrate
to
the
site
of
infection
where
they
fight
the
invading
pathogen
through
antibody
production
and/or
direct
killing
of
the
infected
cells
.

The
effector
T
lymphocyte
population
can
be
broadly
divided
into
two
subsets
,
namely
T
helper
cells
(
Th
)
and
cytotoxic
T
cells
(
CTL
)
,
which
are
identified
by
the
expression
of
CD4
and
CD8
molecules
on
their
surface
,
respectively
7
.

Upon
activation
CD4
+
Th
cells
produce
cytokines
,
which
are
essential
to
help
recruit
and
further
activate/differentiate
other
immune
cell
types
8
.

For
example
,
CD4
+
Th
are
critical
for
B
cell
differentiation
into

The
repositioning
of
drugs
already
approved
by
regulatory
agencies
for
other
indications
is
an
emerging
alternative
for
the
development
of
new
antimicrobial
therapies
.

The
repositioning
process
involves
lower
risks
and
costs
than
the
de
novo
development
of
novel
antimicrobial
drugs
.

Currently
,
infections
by
adenovirus
show
a
steady
increment
with
a
high
clinical
impact
in
immunosuppressed
and
immunocompetent
patients
.

The
lack
of
a
safe
and
efficacious
drug
to
treat
these
infections
supports
the
search
for
new
antiviral
drugs
.

Here
we
evaluated
the
anti-adenovirus
activity
of
niclosanide
,
oxyclozanide
,
and
rafoxanide
,
three
salicylanilide
anthelmintic
drugs
.

Also
,
we
carried
out
the
cytotoxicity
evaluation
and
partial
characterization
of
the
mechanism
of
action
of
these
drugs
.

The
salicylanilide
anthelmintic
drugs
showed
significant
anti-adenovirus
activity
at
low
micromolar
concentrations
with
little
cytotoxicity
.

Moreover
,
our
mechanistic
assays
suggest
differences
in
the
way
the
drugs
exert
anti-adenovirus
activity
.

Niclosamide
and
rafoxanide
target
transport
of
the
HAdV
particle
from
the
endosome
to
the
nuclear
envelope
,
whilst
oxyclozanide
specifically
targets
adenovirus
immediately
early
gene
E1A
transcription
.

Data
suggests
that
the
studied
salicylanilide
anthelmintic
drugs
could
be
suitable
for
further
clinical
evaluation
for
the
development
of
new
antiviral
drugs
to
treat
infections
by
adenovirus
in
immunosuppressed
patients
and
in
immunocompetent
individuals
with
community-acquired
pneumonia

Sixteen

to
identify
novel
cell-surface
biomarkers
indicative
of

.

By
comparing
gene
expression
profi

of
cervical

at

several

We
present
fi
fty-six

products

molecular
farming
offers
a
cost-effective
and
scalable
approach
to
the
expression
of
recombinant
proteins
which
has
been
proposed
as
an
alternative
to
conventional
production
platforms
for
developing
countries
.

In
recent
years
,
numerous
proofs
of
concept
have
established
that
plants
can
produce
biologically
active
recombinant
proteins
and
immunologically
relevant
vaccine
antigens
that
are
comparable
to
those
made
in
conventional
expression
systems
.

Driving
many
of
these
advances
is
the
remarkable
plasticity
of
the
plant
proteome
which
enables
extensive
engineering
of
the
host
cell
,
as
well
as
the
development
of
improved
expression
vectors
facilitating
higher
levels
of
protein
production
.

To
date
,
the
only
plant-derived
viral
glycoprotein
to
be
tested
in
humans
is
the
influenza
haemagglutinin
which
expresses
at~50
mg/kg
.

However
,
many
other
viral
glycoproteins
that
have
potential
as
vaccine
immunogens
only
accumulate
at
low
levels
in
planta
.

A
critical
consideration
for
the
production
of
many
of
these
proteins
in
heterologous
expression
systems
is
the
complexity
of
post-translational
modifications
,
such
as
control
of
folding
,
glycosylation
and
disulphide
bridging
,
which
is
required
to
reproduce
the
native
glycoprotein
structure
.

In
this
review
,
we
will
address
potential
shortcomings
of
plant
expression
systems
and
discuss
strategies
to
optimally
exploit
the
technology
for
the
production
of
immunologically
relevant
and
structurally
authentic
glycoproteins
for
use
as
vaccine
immunogens
.

Increasing
the
intracellular
Zn
2+
concentration
with
zinc-ionophores
like
pyrithione
(
PT
)
can
efficiently
impair
the
replication
of
a
variety
of
RNA
viruses
,
including
poliovirus
and
influenza
virus
.

For
some
viruses
this
effect
has
been
attributed
to
interference
with
viral
polyprotein
processing
.

In
this
study
we
demonstrate
that
the
combination
of
Zn
2+
and
PT
at
low
concentrations
(
2
mM
Zn
2+
and
2
mM
PT
)
inhibits
the
replication
of
SARS-coronavirus
(
SARS-CoV
)
and
equine
arteritis
virus
(
EAV
)
in
cell
culture
.

The
RNA
synthesis
of
these
two
distantly
related
nidoviruses
is
catalyzed
by
an
RNA-dependent
RNA
polymerase
(
RdRp
)
,
which
is
the
core
enzyme
of
their
multiprotein
replication
and
transcription
complex
(
RTC
)
.

Using
an
activity
assay
for
RTCs
isolated
from
cells
infected
with
SARS-CoV
or
EAV-thus
eliminating
the
need
for
PT
to
transport
Zn
2+
across
the
plasma
membrane-we
show
that
Zn
2+
efficiently
inhibits
the
RNA-synthesizing
activity
of
the
RTCs
of
both
viruses
.

Enzymatic
studies
using
recombinant
RdRps
(
SARS-CoV
nsp12
and
EAV
nsp9
)
purified
from
E.
coli
subsequently
revealed
that
Zn
2+
directly
inhibited
the
in
vitro
activity
of
both
nidovirus
polymerases
.

More
specifically
,
Zn
2+
was
found
to
block
the
initiation
step
of
EAV
RNA
synthesis
,
whereas
in
the
case
of
the
SARS-CoV
RdRp
elongation
was
inhibited
and
template
binding
reduced
.

By
chelating
Zn
2+
with
MgEDTA
,
the
inhibitory
effect
of
the
divalent
cation
could
be
reversed
,
which
provides
a
novel
experimental
tool
for
in
vitro
studies
of
the
molecular
details
of
nidovirus
replication
and
transcription

The
aim
of
this
manuscript
is
to
describe
how
modern
advances
in
our
knowledge
of
viruses
and
viral
evolution
can
be
applied
to
the
fields
of
disease
ecology
and
conservation
.

We
review
recent
progress
in
virology
and
provide
examples
of
how
it
is
informing
both
empirical
research
in
field
ecology
and
applied
conservation
.

We
include
a
discussion
of
needed
breakthroughs
and
ways
to
bridge
communication
gaps
between
the
field
and
the
lab
.

In
an
effort
to
foster
this
interdisciplinary
effort
,
we
have
also
included
a
table
that
lists
the
definitions
of
key
terms
.

The
importance
of
understanding
the
dynamics
of
zoonotic
pathogens
in
their
reservoir
hosts
is
emphasized
as
a
tool
to
both
assess
risk
factors
for
spillover
and
to
test
hypotheses
related
to
treatment
and/or
intervention
strategies
.

In
conclusion
,
we
highlight
the
need
for
smart
surveillance
,
viral
discovery
efforts
and
predictive
modeling
.

A
shift
towards
a
predictive
approach
is
necessary
in
today
's
globalized
society
because
,
as
the
2009
H1N1
pandemic
demonstrated
,
identification
post-emergence
is
often
too
late
to
prevent
global
spread
.

Integrating
molecular
virology
and
ecological
techniques
will
allow
for
earlier
recognition
of
potentially
dangerous
pathogens
,
ideally
before
they
jump
from
wildlife
reservoirs
into
human
or
livestock
populations
and
cause
serious
public
health
or
conservation
issues

This
article
examines
the
challenges
that
the
national
emergency
medical
services
and
volunteers
faced
in
the
process
of
implementing

A
very
recent
outbreak
of
the
novel
coronavirus
,
COVID-19
,
in
the
city
of
Wuhan
,
China
,
in
December
2019
and
its
subsequent
spread
within
and
across
China
have
resulted
in
several
deaths
and
infections
.

Presently
,
nucleic
acid
amplification
test
is
essential
for
the
confirmation
of
COVID
infection
.

In
this
report
,
we
summarized
the
six
promising
methods
,
including
whole-genome
sequencing
,
real-time
reverse
transcription
polymerase
chain
reaction
,
nanopore
target
sequencing
,
antibody-based
immunoassay
techniques
,
use
of
paper-based
biomolecular
sensors
,
and
the
clustered
regularly
interspaced
short
palindromic
repeats-Cas
system-based
technology
,
which
can
also
be
deployed
for
the
detection
of
SARS-CoV-2
.

We
further
introduced
the
principles
of
these
methods
,
discussed
the
scope
and
practicability
of
application
of
the
available
products
and
methods
,
and
highlighted
the
potential
approaches
to
develop
additional
products
and
techniques
for
early
diagnosis
of
COVID-19
.

The
novel
coronavirus
(
2019-nCoV
,
or
COVID-19
)
epidemic
first
broke
out
in
Wuhan
and
has
been
spreading
in
whole
China
and
the
world
.

The
numbers
of
new
infections
and
deaths
in
Wuhan
are
still
increasing
,
which
have
posed
major
public
health
and
governance
concerns
.

A
series
of
mandatory
actions
have
been
taken
by
the
municipal
and
provincial
governments
supported
by
the
central
government
,
such
as
measures
to
restrict
travels
across
cities
,
case
detection
and
contact
tracing
,
quarantine
,
guidance
and
information
to
the
public
,
detection
kit
development
,
etc
.

Challenges
such
as
lacking
effective
drugs
,
insufficient
hospital
services
and
medical
supplies
,
logistics
,
etc
.

have
much
alleviated
with
the
solidarity
of
the
whole
society
.

The
pandemic
will
definitely
be
ended
with
the
continuous
efforts
of
both
national
and
international
multi-sectoral
bodies
.

We
report
here
the
complete
genome
sequence
of
the
porcine
epidemic
diarrhea
virus
strain
CH/ZMDZY/11
isolated
from
central
China
.

Our
data
,
together
with
sequence
data
of
porcine
epidemic
diarrhea
virus
(
PEDV
)
isolates
from
other
parts
in
China
,
will
help
to
understand
better
the
epidemiology
and
genetic
diversity
of
PEDV
field
isolates
in
China
.

Since
December
2019
,
the
outbreak
of
pneumonia
caused
by
a
new
coronavirus
[

]
,
which
was
later
identified
as
coronavirus
disease
2019
(
COVID19

,
has
infected
more
than
410,000
patients
globally
according
to
the

of
World

Lung
ultrasound
is
an
important
tool
for
the
diagnosis
and
follow-up
of
pneumonia
in
neonates
,
children
,
and
adults
[

[

.

Recent
CT
reports
demonstrated
that
most
of
the
lesions
were
distributed
peripherally
in
the
lung
,
which
facilitates
detection
by
lung
ultrasound
[

]
.

In
this
study
,
we
characterize
the
lung
ultrasound
findings
COVID-19
pneumonia
,
and
study
the
relationship
between
the
ultrasound
findings
and
clinical
severity
and
the
time-course
of
disease
progress
.

Bedside
lung
ultrasound
was
performed
to
detect
B-lines
,
lung
consolidation
,
and
pleural
line
abnormalities
at
5
areas
in
each
lung
.

Vascular
ultrasound
was
also
performed
to
detect
potential
deep
vein
thrombosis
.

A
total
of
20
patients
of
COVID-19
pneumonia
(
12
males
and
8
females
)
were
categorized
as
4
moderate
,
5
severe
,
and
11
critical
cases
according
to
the
current
diagnosis
and
treatment
program
.

All
patients
showed
abnormal
lung
ultrasound
findings
,
including
100
%
(

pleural
line
abnormalities
,
100
%
(

)
B-lines
,
and
50
%
(

)
consolidation
.

Most
of
the
moderate
and
severe
cases
could
show
both
separated
B-lines
and
confluent
B-lines
during
admission
.

All
critical
patients
showed
confluent
Blines
,
and
18
%
(
2
)
of
them
had
compact
B-lines
.

Bilateral
involvement
was
observed
in
all
patients
.

The
predominate
involved
areas
in
moderate
patients
were
on
the
back
,
i.e.
,
the
interscapular
and
infrascapular
areas
.

For
severe
and
critical
patients
,
all
5
areas
could
be
involved
.

Consolidations
were
not
detected
in
moderate
cases
,
and
distributed
mainly
on
the
posterior
areas
in
severe
and
critical
cases
.

Pleural
effusion
(
18
%
,
2
cases
)
,
pericardial
effusion
(
9
%
,
1
case
)
,
and
deep
vein
thrombosis
(
64
%
,
5
cases
)
were
only
found
in
critical
patients
.

(
Table

.

A
total
of
36
ultrasound
examinations
were
categorized
to
four
groups
based
on
the
time
interval
between
onset
of
symptoms
and
ultrasound
examinations
(
1st
to
4th
week
)
.

All
of
the
examinations
showed
abnormal
lung
ultrasound
findings
,
including
100
%
(
36
)
pleural
line
abnormalities
,
100
%
(
36
)
B-lines
,
and
64
%
(

)
consolidation
.

The
separate
B-lines
were
found
more
than
half
of
the
examinations
after
the
2nd
week
.

The
majority
of
examinations
during
the
2nd
and
3rd
weeks
showed
confluent
B-lines
.

The
involvement
of
anterior
areas
with
B-lines
decreased
along
with
the
infected
time
course
.

The
lateral
and
back
areas
were
always
involved
in
all
stages
for
B-lines
.

Consolidations
were
found
in
more
than
half
examinations
after
the
1st
week
.

Most
of
consolidation
lesions
confined
within
unilateral
lung
except
at
the
2nd
week
.

The
anterior
and
lateral
areas
were
not
involved
of
consolidations
during
1st
and
4th
week
.

Consolidations
were

A
mainstream
procedure
to
analyze
the
wealth
of
genomic
data
available
nowadays
is
the
detection
of
homologous
regions
shared
across
genomes
,
followed
by
the
extraction
of
biological
information
from
the
patterns
of
conservation
and
variation
observed
in
such
regions
.

Although
of
pivotal
importance
,
comparative
genomic
procedures
that
rely
on
homology
inference
are
obviously
not
applicable
if
no
homologous
regions
are
detectable
.

This
fact
excludes
a
considerable
portion
of
``
genomic
dark
matter
''
with
no
significant
similarityand
,
consequently
,
no
inferred
homology
to
any
other
known
sequencefrom
several
downstream
comparative
genomic
methods
.

In
this
review
we
compile
several
sequence
metrics
that
do
not
rely
on
homology
inference
and
can
be
used
to
compare
nucleotide
sequences
and
extract
biologically
meaningful
information
from
them
.

These
metrics
comprise
several
compositional
parameters
calculated
from
sequence
data
alone
,
such
as
GC
content
,
dinucleotide
odds
ratio
,
and
several
codon
bias
metrics
.

They
also
share
other
interesting
properties
,
such
as
pervasiveness
(
patterns
persist
on
smaller
scales
)
and
phylogenetic
signal
.

We
also
cite
examples
where
these
homologyindependent
metrics
have
been
successfully
applied
to
support
several
bioinformatics
challenges
,
such
as
taxonomic
classification
of
biological
sequences
without
homology
inference
.

They
where
also
used
to
detect
higher-order
patterns
of
interactions
in
biological
systems
,
ranging
from
detecting
coevolutionary
trends
between
the
genomes
of
viruses
and
their
hosts
to
characterization
of
gene
pools
of
entire
microbial
communities
.

We
argue
that
,
if
correctly
understood
and
applied
,
homology-independent
metrics
can
add
important
layers
of
biological
information

.

Background
:
Secondary
inhalation
of
medical
aerosols
is
a
significant
occupational
hazard
in
both
clinical
and
homecare
settings
.

Exposure
to
fugitive
emissions
generated
during
aerosol
therapy
increases
the
risk
of
the
unnecessary
inhalation
of
medication
,
as
well
as
toxic
side
effects
.

Methods
:
This
study
examines
fugitively-emitted
aerosol
emissions
when
nebulising
albuterol
sulphate
,
as
a
tracer
aerosol
,
using
two
commercially
available
nebulisers
in
combination
with
an
open
or
valved
facemask
or
using
a
mouthpiece
with
and
without
a
filter
on
the
exhalation
port
.

Each
combination
was
connected
to
a
breathing
simulator
during
simulated
adult
breathing
.

The
inhaled
dose
and
residual
mass
were
quantified
using
UV
spectrophotometry
.

Time-varying
fugitively-emitted
aerosol
concentrations
and
size
distributions
during
nebulisation
were
recorded
using
aerodynamic
particle
sizers
at
two
distances
relative
to
the
simulated
patient
.

Different
aerosol
concentrations
and
size
distributions
were
observed
depending
on
the
interface
.

Results
:
Within
each
nebuliser
,
the
facemask
combination
had
the
highest
time-averaged
fugitively-emitted
aerosol
concentration
,
and
values
up
to
0.072
±
0.001
mg
m
−3
were
recorded
.

The
placement
of
a
filter
on
the
exhalation
port
of
the
mouthpiece
yielded
the
lowest
recorded
concentrations
.

The
mass
median
aerodynamic
diameter
of
the
fugitively-emitted
aerosol
was
recorded
as
0.890
±
0.044
µm
,
lower
the
initially
generated
medical
aerosol
in
the
range
of
2-5
µm
.

Conclusions
:
The
results
highlight
the
potential
secondary
inhalation
of
exhaled
aerosols
from
commercially
available
nebuliser
facemask/mouthpiece
combinations
.

The
results
will
aid
in
developing
approaches
to
inform
policy
and
best
practices
for
risk
mitigation
from
fugitive
emissions

To
search
for
cellular
genes
up-regulated
by
vaccinia
virus
(
VV
)
infection
,
differential
displayreverse
transcription-polymerase
chain
reaction
(
ddRT-PCR
)
assays
were
used
to
examine
the
expression
of
mRNAs
from
mock-infected
and
VV-infected
HeLa
cells
.

Two
mitochondrial
genes
for
proteins
that
are
part
of
the
electron
transport
chain
that
generates
ATP
,
ND4
and
CO
II
,
were
up-regulated
after
VV
infection
.

Up-regulation
of
ND4
level
by
VV
infection
was
confirmed
by
Western
blotting
analysis
.

Up-regulation
of
ND4
was
reduced
by
the
MAPK
inhibitor
,
apigenin
,
which
has
been
demonstrated
elsewhere
to
inhibit
VV
replication
.

The
induction
of
ND4
expression
occurred
after
viral
DNA
replication
since
ara
C
,
an
inhibitor
of
poxviral
DNA
replication
,
could
block
this
induction
.

ATP
production
was
increased
in
the
host
cells
after
VV
infection
.

Moreover
,
4.5
μM
oligomycin
,
an
inhibitor
of
ATP
production
,
reduced
the
ATP
level
13
hr
after
virus
infection
to
that
of
mock-infected
cells
and
inhibited
viral
protein
expression
and
virus
production
,
suggesting
that
increased
ATP
production
is
required
for
efficient
VV
production
.

Our
results
further
suggest
that
induction
of
ND4
expression
is
through
a
Bcl-2
independent
pathway
.

As
a
host
factor
,
PACT
provides
protection
against
the
pathogenic
influenza
A
virus
by
interacting
with
IAV
polymerase
and
activating
the
IFN-I
response
.

To
verify
the
whether
IGEs
suppress
IAV
replication
in
a
PACT-dependent
manner
,
IAV
RNA
replication
,
expression
of
PACT
and
the
phosphorylation
of
eIF2α
in
A549
cells
were
detected
;
the
levels
of
IFNβ
,
PACT
and
PKR
in
mouse
lung
tissues
were
determined
;
and
the
activity
of
IAV
polymerase
was
evaluated
in
PACT-compromised
cells
.

The
results
indicated
that
IGEs
sufficiently
alleviated
cell
damage
and
suppressed
IAV
replication
in
vitro
,
protecting
mice
from
IAV-induced
injury
and
lethal
IAV
infection
.

These
anti-IAV
effects
might
be
related
to
disrupted
interplay
between
IVA
polymerase
and
PACT
and/or
prevention
of
a
PACT-dependent
overactivated
IFN-I
antiviral
response
.

Taken
together
,
our
findings
reveal
a
new
facet
of
the
mechanisms
by
which
IGEs
fight
the
influenza
A
virus
in
a
PACT-dependent
manner
.

Background
:
Human
rhinovirus
(
HRV
)
infections
are
the
primary
cause
of
the
common
cold
and
are
a
major
trigger
for
exacerbations
of
lower
airway
diseases
,
such
as
asthma
and
chronic
obstructive
pulmonary
diseases
.

Although
human
bronchial
epithelial
cells
(
HBE
)
are
the
natural
host
for
HRV
infections
,
much
of
our
understanding
of
how
HRV
replicates
and
induces
host
antiviral
responses
is
based
on
studies
using
non-airway
cell
lines
(
e.g
.

HeLa
cells
)
.

The
current
study
examines
the
replication
cycle
of
HRV
,
and
host
cell
responses
,
in
highly
differentiated
cultures
of
HBE
.

Methods
:
Highly
differentiated
cultures
of
HBE
were
exposed
to
initial
infectious
doses
ranging
from

to

culture-infective
dose
(
TCID

)
of
purified
HRV-16
,
and
responses
were
monitored
up
to
144
h
after
infection
.

Viral
genomic
RNA
and
negative
strand
RNA
template
levels
were
monitored
,
along
with
levels
of
type
I
and
II
interferons
and
selected
antivirals
.

Results
:
Regardless
of
initial
infectious
dose
,
relatively
constant
levels
of
both
genomic
and
negative
strand
RNA
are
generated
during
replication
,
with
negative
strand
copy
numbers
being10,000-fold
lower
than
those
of
genomic
strands
.

Infections
were
limited
to
a
small
percentage
of
ciliated
cells
and
did
not
result
in
any
overt
signs
of
epithelial
death
.

Importantly
,
regardless
of
infectious
dose
,
HRV-16
infections
were
cleared
by
HBE
in
the
absence
of
immune
cells
.

Levels
of
type
I
and
type
III
interferons
(
IFNs
)
varied
with
initial
infectious
dose
,
implying
that
factors
other
than
levels
of
double-stranded
RNA
regulate
IFN
induction
,
but
the
time-course
of
HRV-16
clearance
HBE
was
the
same
regardless
of
levels
of
IFNs
produced
.

Patterns
of
antiviral
viperin
and
ISG15
expression
suggest
they
may
be
generated
in
an
IFN-independent
manner
during
HRV-16
infections
.

Conclusions
:
These
data
challenge
a
number
of
aspects
of
dogma
generated
from
studies
in
HeLa
cells
and
emphasize
the
importance
of

SNPs

Other
accessory

genes
appeared
normal
in
both

Deliterious
mutations
in
the
3c
gene
were
unique
to
each
cat
,
indicating
that
they
did
not
originate
in
one
cat
and
were
subsequently
passed
horizontally
to
the
others
.

Compartmentalization
of
the
parental

mutant
forms

;
virus
of
lesional
type
was
sometimes
found
in
feces
of
affected
cats
and
virus
identical
to
fecal
type
was
occasionally
identified
in
diseased

.

Although
3c
gene

in
this

were
not

report
the
development
of

The
salt
coating
on
the

surface
dissolves
upon
exposure
to
virus
aerosols
and
recrystallizes
during
drying
,
destroying
the
pathogens
.

When
tested
with
tightly

sides
,
salt-coated
filters
showed
remarkably
higher
filtration
efficiency
than

Viruses
captured
on
salt-coated
filters
exhibited
rapid
infectivity

compared
to
gradual
decrease

.

Salt-coated

effective
in

.

We

.

During

.

Schools
being

Despite
the

the

Background

Advances

But
as
a
double-edged
sword
,
due
to
the
high
sensitivity
of
PCR
,
the
type
of

is
critical
to

.

In
this

Metabolomics
aims
to
measure
and
characterise
the
complex
composition
of
metabolites
in
a
biological
system
.

Metabolomics
studies
involve
sophisticated
analytical
techniques
such
as
mass

and
nuclear
magnetic
resonance
spectroscopy
,
and
generate
large
amounts

Open

tools
are
of
major
interest
in
light
of
innovative

reproducible
science
.

The
scientific
community
has
developed
a
wide
range
of
open

software
,
providing
freely
available
advanced

The

has
emerged
as
one
of
the
most
popular
environments
to
process
and
analyse
Metabolomics
datasets
.

A
major
benefit
of
such
an
environment
is
the
possibility
of
connecting
different
tools
into
more
complex
workflows
.

Combining
reusable
data
processing
R
scripts
with
the
experimental

thus
allows
for
open

reproducible
research
.

This

provides
an
extensive

of
existing

Background
:
Leukemia
is
one
of
the
most
life-threatening
cancers
today
,
and
acute
promyelogenous
leukemia
(
APL
)
is
a
common
type
of
leukemia
.

Many
natural
compounds
have
already
been
found
to
exhibit
significant
antitumor
effects
.

Lycorine
,
a
natural
alkaloid
extracted
from
Amaryllidaceae
,
exhibited
anti-leukemia
effects
in
vitro
and
in
vivo
.

The
survival
rate
of
HL-60
cells
exposed
to
lycorine
was
decreased
,
cell
growth
was
slowed
down
,
and
cell
regeneration
potential
was
inhibited
.

HL-60
cells
exhibited
typical
apoptotic
characteristic
.

Lycorine
can
suppress
leukemia
growth
and
reduce
cell
survival
and
inducing
apoptosis
of
tumor
cells
.

The
purpose
of
this
work
is
to
elucidate
the
mechanism
by
which
lycorine
induces
APL
cells
.

Results
:
When
HL-60
cells
were
treated
with
different
concentration
of
lycorine
,
the
expression
of
p21
and
TNF-α
was
up-regulated
in
a
concentration-dependent
manner
as
shown
by
real-time
quantitative
reverse
transcriptasepolymerase
chain
reaction
and
Western
blotting
.

Lycorine
also
down-regulated
p21-related
gene
expression
,
including
Cdc2
,
Cyclin
B
,
Cdk2
and
Cyclin
E
,
promoted
Bid
truncation
,
decreased
IB
phosphorylation
and
blocked
NF-B
nuclear
import
.

Cytochrome
c
was
released
from
mitochondria
as
observed
with
confocal
laser
microscopy
.

Conclusions
:
The
TNF-α
signal
transduction
pathway
and
p21-mediated
cell-cycle
inhibition
were
involved
in
the
apoptosis
of
HL-60
cells
induced
by
lycorine
.

These
results
contribute
to
the
development
of
new
lycorine-based
anti-leukemia
drugs
.

Background
:
Genes
under
selection
provide
ecologically
important
information
useful
for
conservation
issues
.

Major
histocompatibility
complex
(
MHC
)
class
I
and
II
genes
are
essential
for
the
immune
defence
against
pathogens
from
intracellular
(
e.g
.

viruses
)
and
extracellular
(
e.g
.

helminths
)
origins
,
respectively
.

Serosurvey
studies
in
Namibian
cheetahs
(
Acinonyx
juabuts
)
revealed
higher
exposure
to
viral
pathogens
in
individuals
from
north-central
than
east-central
regions
.

Here
we
examined
whether
the
observed
differences
in
exposure
to
viruses
influence
the
patterns
of
genetic
variation
and
differentiation
at
MHC
loci
in
88
free-ranging
Namibian
cheetahs
.

Methodology/Principal
Findings
:
Genetic
variation
at
MHC
I
and
II
loci
was
assessed
through
single-stranded
conformation
polymorphism
(
SSCP
)
analysis
and
sequencing
.

While
the
overall
allelic
diversity
did
not
differ
,
we
observed
a
high
genetic
differentiation
at
MHC
class
I
loci
between
cheetahs
from
north-central
and
east-central
Namibia
.

No
such
differentiation
in
MHC
class
II
and
neutral
markers
were
found
.

Conclusions/Significance
:
Our
results
suggest
that
MHC
class
I
variation
mirrors
the
variation
in
selection
pressure
imposed
by
viruses
in
free-ranging
cheetahs
across
Namibian
farmland
.

This
is
of
high
significance
for
future
management
and
conservation
programs
of
this
species

Hepatitis
C
virus
(
HCV
)
enters
human
hepatocytes
using
four
essential
entry
factors
,
one
of
which
is
human
CD81
(
hCD81
)
.

The
tetraspanin
hCD81
contains
a
large
extracellular
loop
(
LEL
)
,
which
interacts
with
the
E2
glycoprotein
of
HCV
.

The
role
of
the
non-LEL
regions
of
hCD81
(
intracellular
tails
,
four
transmembrane
domains
,
small
extracellular
loop
and
intracellular
loop
)
is
poorly
understood
.

Here
,
we
studied
the
contribution
of
these
domains
to
HCV
susceptibility
of
hepatoma
cells
by
generating
chimeras
of
related
tetraspanins
with
the
hCD81
LEL
.

Our
results
show
that
non-LEL
regions
in
addition
to
the
LEL
determine
susceptibility
of
cells
to
HCV
.

While
closely
related
tetraspanins
(
X.
tropicalis
CD81
and
D.
rerio
CD81
)
functionally
complement
hCD81
non-LEL
regions
,
distantly
related
tetraspanins
(
C.
elegans
TSP9
amd
D.
melanogaster
TSP96F
)
do
not
and
tetraspanins
with
intermediate
homology
(
hCD9
)
show
an
intermediate
phenotype
.

Tetraspanin
homology
and
susceptibility
to
HCV
correlate
positively
.

For
some
chimeras
,
infectivity
correlates
with
surface
expression
.

In
contrast
,
the
hCD9
chimera
is
fully
surface
expressed
,
binds
HCV
E2
glycoprotein
but
is
impaired
in
HCV
receptor
function
.

We
demonstrate
that
a
cholesterol-coordinating
glutamate
residue
in
CD81
,
which
hCD9
lacks
,
promotes
HCV
infection
.

This
work
highlights
the
hCD81
non-LEL
regions
as
additional
HCV
susceptibility-determining
factors

Hepatitis

LDLR
instead
of
SR-BI

and
presumably
relies
on
the
HCV
particle
associated
serum
lipoproteins
[
12
,

.

In
contrast
,
SR-BI
and
hCD81
bind
HCV
particles
directly
through
the
viral
E2
glycoprotein
[
8
,
11
]
.

In
addition
,
hCD81
mediates
post-binding
steps
in
HCV
entry
.

It
translocates
with
the
virus
along
the
plasma
membrane
[
14
]
,
it
co-endocytoses
with
the
virus
[
15
]
and
it
triggers
conformational
changes
in
the
viral
E1/E2
glycoproteins
rendering
them
competent
for
fusion
with
the
endosomal
membrane
[
16
]
.

Which
domains
of
hCD81
are
required
for
these
post-binding
functions
remains
largely
elusive
.

CD81
belongs
to
the
tetraspanin
protein
family
.

It
is
surface
expressed
and
consists
of
four
transmembrane
domains
,
two
short
cytoplasmic
termini
,
one
short
cytoplasmic
loop
and
two
extracellular
domains
,
termed
the
small
extracellular
loop
(
SEL
)
and
the
large
extracellular
loop
(
LEL
)
.

Tetraspanins
lack
signaling
domains
,
but
coordinate
PPIs
and
lipid
interactions
in
tetraspanin
webs

Human
CD81
associates
with
the
HCV
entry
factors
SR-BI
and
CLDN1
[
21
,
22

and
co-factors
,

factor
binding
protein
1
(
SRFBP1
)
[
22
,

]
.

Thus
,
hCD81
has
at
least
two
functions
during
HCV
entry
.

First
,
it
concentrates
HCV
at
the
cell
surface
.

Second
,
it
engages
in
interactions
with
host
proteins
and
lipids
needed
for
post-binding
entry
steps
.

For
the
former
,
the
structure-function
relationship
of
hCD81
has
been
extensively
analyzed
[
8
,
24
,
25
]
.

Specifically
,
the
LEL
region
of
hCD81
directly
interacts
with
HCV
E2
glycoprotein
.

In
contrast
,
the
structural
requirements
of
hCD81
to
engage
in
protein
and
lipid
interactions
needed
for
HCV
entry
are
poorly
defined
.

To
function
as
a
HCV
receptor
,
CD81
needs
to
dynamically
move
in
the
plasma
membrane
,
possibly
to
engage
in
different
molecular
interactions
during
virus
penetration
[

.

Some
interactions
of
hCD81
with
host
proteins
such
as
immunoglobulin
superfamily
member
8
(
IGSF8
)
map
to
regions
outside
the
LEL
,
here
referred
to
as
backbone
[
27
]
.

In
addition
,
transmembrane
domains
one
and
four
form
hydrogen
bonds
with
cholesterol
[
19
]
.

Thus
,
the
hCD81
backbone
(
intracellular
tails
,
four
transmembrane
domains
,
small
extracellular
loop
and
intracellular
loop
)
can
coordinate
interactions
with
lipids
and
proteins
,
some
of
which
may
be
required
for
HCV
cell
entry
.

Importantly
,
hCD81
is
one
of
the
species
tropism
determining
factors
for
HCV
[
24

.

The
virus
naturally
infects
humans
and
can
experimentally
infect
chimpanzees
and
tupaias
[
28
]
[

]
[
30
]
.

A
combination
of
host
factor
incompatibility
and
innate
immune
restriction
leads
to
this
narrow
host
tropism

inefficiently
function
as
HCV

renders
mice
susceptible
to
HCV

.

In

studies
demonstrate
that
the

not
bind

.

Therefore
,
CD81
backbone
functions
are
conserved
between
human
and

Whether
any
tetraspanin
backbone
from
more
distantly
related
species
than
rodents
could
substitute
the
hCD81
backbone
function
in
HCV
entry
remains
largely
undefined
.

Here
,
we
set
out
to
investigate
whether
regions
of
hCD81
outside
the
LEL
are
critical
determinants
of
HCV
entry

Therefore
,
we
constructed
and
characterized
chimeric
tetraspanins
composed
of
the
hCD81
LEL
and
backbone

tested
chimeras
can
bind

fail
to
support
HCV
cell
entry

In
particular
,
backbones
from

related
tetraspanins
such
as
the
Drosophila

ortholog

fail
to
function
as
efficient
HCV
receptors

While
for
some
chimeras
reduced

expression
correlates
with
reduced
receptor
function
,
the

2
(
PEMV2
)
is
a
nonsegmented
,
positive-sense
RNA
virus
with
an
unusually
long
3=
UTR
that
is
susceptible
to
NMD
.

To
establish
a
systemic
infection
,
the
PEMV2
long-distance
movement
protein
p26
was
previously
shown
to
both
stabilize
viral
RNAs
and
bind
them
for
transport
through
the
plant
's
vascular
system
.

The
current
study
demonstrated
that
p26
protects
both
viral
and
nonviral
messenger
RNAs
from
NMD
.

Although
p26
localizes
to
both
the
cytoplasm
and
nucleolus
,
p26
exerts
its
anti-NMD
effects
exclusively
in
the
cytoplasm
independently
of
long-distance
movement
.

Using
a
transcriptome-wide
approach
in
the
model
plant
Nicotiana
benthamiana
,
p26
protected
a
subset
of
cellular
NMD
target
transcripts
,
particularly
those
containing
long
,
structured
,
GC-rich
3=
UTRs
.

Furthermore
,
transcriptome
sequencing
(
RNA-seq
)
revealed
that
the
NMD
pathway
is
highly
dysfunctional
during
PEMV2
infection
,
with
1,820
(
48
%
)
of
NMD
targets
increasing
in
abundance
.

Widespread
changes
in
the
host
transcriptome
are
common
during
plant
RNA
virus
infections
,
and
these
results
suggest
that
,
in
at
least
some
instances
,
virus-mediated
NMD
inhibition
may
be
a
major
contributing
factor
.

IMPORTANCE
Nonsense-mediated
decay
(
NMD
)
represents
an
RNA
regulatory
pathway
that
degrades
both
natural
and
faulty
messenger
RNAs
with
long
3=
untranslated
regions
.

NMD
targets
diverse
families
of
RNA
viruses
,
requiring
that
viruses
counteract
the
NMD
pathway
for
successful
amplification
in
host
cells
.

of
Pea

(
PEMV2
)
is
shown
to
also
protect
both
viral
and
host
mRNAs
from
NMD
.

RNA-seq
analyses
of
the
Nicotiana

transcriptome
revealed
that
PEMV2
infection
significantly
impairs
the
host
NMD
pathway
.

RNA
viruses
routinely
induce
large-scale
changes
in
host
gene
expression
,
and
,
like
PEMV2
,
may
use
NMD
inhibition
to
alter
the
host
transcriptome
in
an
effort
to
increase
virus
amplification

They

.

All
doses
of
galloyl-HHDP-glucose
inhibited
LPS-induced
JNK

.

Likewise
,
the
galloyl-HHDP-glucose-treated
animals
presented
reduced
expression
of
the
TNF-α

In

treated
with

Overall
,
we
showed
for
the

Lactation
,

The

the
differentially

genes
(
DEGs
)
between

.

Three
microarray

were
used
.

Samples

and
post-peak
(

were
selected
.

Meta-analysis
revealed
31
DEGs
across
the
studied
species
.

Interestingly
,
10
genes
,

,
were
not
detected
in

that
highlights
meta-analysis
power
in

.

Common

highlighted
the
high
connectivity
of
CTNNB1
,
CDD4
and
LPL
as
gene
network
hubs
.

As
data
originally
came
from
three
different
species
,
to
check
the
effects
of
heterogeneous
data
sources
on
DEGs
,
10
attribute
weighting
(

algorithms
were
applied
.

Attribute
weighting
results
showed
that
the
type
of
organism
had
no
or
little
effect
on
the
selected
gene
list
.

Systems
biology
analysis
suggested
that
these
DEGs
affect
the
milk
production
by
improving
the
immune
system
performance
and
mammary
cell
growth
.

This

of
mammary
glands
in
two

Retrotransposons

mobile
genetic
elements

their
mobility

.

Retrotransposon
insertions
are
associated
with
a
diverse
range
of
sporadic
diseases
,

Thus
,

Here
,
we
investigated
a
potential
role
for
the
OAS-RNase
L
system
in
the
restriction
of

Furthermore
,
WT
RNase

,
but
not
an
inactive
RNase
L
mutant
(

)
,
reduced

levels
and
subsequent
expression
of
the
L1-encoded
proteins
(
ORF1p
and
ORF2p

.

Consistently
,
confocal
immunofluorescent

demonstrated
that
WT

L
,

not
RNase

Finally

siRNA-mediated
depletion
of
endogenous
RNase

cancer
cell
line
(

increased
the

retrotransposition
by
$
2-fold
.

Together
,
these
data
suggest
that

might
function
as
a

.

The
potential
to
inhibit
other
viruses
as
well
as
parasites
has
also
been
demonstrated
.

Griffithsin

antiviral
activity
stems
from
its
ability

bind
terminal

Apolipoprotein
(
Apo
)
D
is
an
important
protein
produced
in
many
parts
of
the
body
.

It
is
necessary
for
the
development
and
repair
of
the
brain
and
protection
from
oxidative
stress
.

The
purpose
of
this
study
was
to
investigate
the
extent
to
which
apoD
interacts
with
lipoproteins
in
human
plasma
.

By
using
detergent-free
ELISA
,
we
show
that
immobilized
monoclonal
antibodies
against
apoD
very
efficiently
bind
to
low
density
lipoprotein
(
LDL
)
from
plasma
;
this
binding
is
as
equally
efficient
as
binding
to
an
anti-apoB
monoclonal
antibody
.

Adding
detergent
to
the
plasma
inhibited
the
binding
,
suggesting
that
the
binding
is
dependent
on
the
presence
of
intact
lipoprotein
particles
.

Reversing
the
system
by
using
immobilized
anti-apoB
revealed
that
the
affinity
of
apoD
for
LDL
is
rather
low
,
suggesting
that
multiple
bindings
are
needed
for
a
durable
connection
.

Biosensor
experiments
using
purified
lipoproteins
also
showed
that
purified
apoD
and
high
density
lipoprotein
3
(
HDL3
)
,
a
lipoprotein
fraction
rich
in
apoD
,
were
both
able
to
bind
LDL
very
efficiently
,
indicating
that
the
HDL3-LDL
interaction
may
be
a
physiological
consequence
of
the
affinity
of
apoD
for
LDL
.

Furthermore
,
we
found
that
apoD
increases
the
binding
of
HDL
to
actively
growing
T24
bladder
carcinoma
cells
but
not
to
quiescent
,
contact-inhibited
,
confluent
T24
cells
.

This
result
is
especially
intriguing
given
that
the
T24
supernatant
only
contained
detectable
levels
of
apoD
after
growth
inhibition
,
raising
the
possibility
that
alternating
the
expression
of
apoD
and
a
putative
apoD-receptor
could
give
direction
to
the
flow
of
lipids
.

In
the
current
paper
,
we
conclude
that
apoD
mediates
binding
of
HDL
to
LDL
and
to
growing
T24
carcinomas
,
thereby
highlighting
the
importance
of
apoD
in
lipid
metabolism

Background
:
Multiple
infections
are
common
in
natural
host
populations
and
interspecific
parasite
interactions
are
therefore
likely
within
a
host
individual
.

As
they
may
seriously
impact
the
circulation
of
certain
parasites
and
the
emergence
and
management
of
infectious
diseases
,
their
study
is
essential
.

In
the
field
,
detecting
parasite
interactions
is
rendered
difficult
by
the
fact
that
a
large
number
of
co-infected
individuals
may
also
be
observed
when
two
parasites
share
common
risk
factors
.

To
correct
for
these
``
false
interactions
''
,
methods
accounting
for
parasite
risk
factors
must
be
used
.

In
the
present
paper
we
propose
such
a
method
for
presence-absence
data
(
i.e.
,
serology
)
.

Our
method
enables
the
calculation
of
the
expected
frequencies
of
single
and
double
infected
individuals
under
the
independence
hypothesis
,
before
comparing
them
to
the
observed
ones
using
the
chi-square
statistic
.

The
method
is
termed
``
the
corrected
chi-square
.
''

Its
robustness
was
compared
to
a
pre-existing
method
based
on
logistic
regression
and
the
corrected
chi-square
proved
to
be
much
more
robust
for
small
sample
sizes
.

Since
the
logistic
regression
approach
is
easier
to
implement
,
we
propose
as
a
rule
of
thumb
to
use
the
latter
when
the
ratio
between
the
sample
size
and
the
number
of
parameters
is
above
ten
.

Applied
to
serological
data
for
four
viruses
infecting
cats
,
the
approach
revealed
pairwise
interactions
between
the
Feline
Herpesvirus
,
Parvovirus
and
Calicivirus
,
whereas
the
infection
by
FIV
,
the
feline
equivalent
of
HIV
,
did
not
modify
the
risk
of
infection
by
any
of
these
viruses
.

Conclusions/Significance
:
This
work
therefore
points
out
possible
interactions
that
can
be
further
investigated
in
experimental
conditions
and
,
by
providing
a
user-friendly
R
program
and
a
tutorial
example
,
offers
new
opportunities
for
animal
and
human
epidemiologists
to
detect
interactions
of
interest
in
the
field
,
a
crucial
step
in
the
challenge
of
multiple
infections

A
stable
culture
of
primary
porcine
enterocytes
is
necessary
to
study
porcine
enteric
virus
replication
characteristics
.

Because
the
direct
cultivation
of
primary
porcine
enterocytes
is
difficult
,
alternatives
have
to
be
considered
.

As
subepithelial
myofibroblasts
secrete
extracellular
matrix
and
growth
factors
contributing
to
the
attachment
,
proliferation
and
differentiation
of
epithelial
cells
,
co-cultures
of
primary
porcine
enterocytes
(
ileocytes
and
colonocytes
)
with
myofibroblasts
were
developed
and
evaluated
for
their
susceptibility
to
enteric
viruses
.

First
,
it
was
demonstrated
that
the
co-cultured
ileocytes
and
colonocytes
were
susceptible
to
an
archival
rotavirus
strain
RVA/pig-tc/BEL/RV277/1977/

]
and

other

,

]
,

)
.

Next
,
the
TGEV
Purdue
strain
infected
both
ileocytes
and
colonocytes
whereas
the
Miller
strain
only
infected
ileocytes
.

Last
,
the
PEDV
CV777
Vero
adapted
and
non-adapted
(
fecal
suspension
)
strains
could
infect
co-cultured
ileocytes
but
not
colonocytes
.

The
infectivity
of
the
CV777
Vero
adapted
strain
was
higher
when
the
cells
were
cultured
without
fetal
bovine
serum
and
the
CV777
fecal
suspension
only
infected
the
ileocytes
cultured
without
fetal
bovine
serum
.

In
conclusion
,
a
novel
co-culture
of
porcine
enterocytes
with
myofibroblasts
was
established
,
which
can
be
used
for
the
investigation
of
the
replication
of
enteric
viruses
.

First
identified
in
The
Netherlands
in
2004
,
human
coronavirus
NL63
(
HCoV-NL63
)
was
found
to
cause
worldwide
infections
.

Patients
infected
by
HCoV-NL63
are
typically
young
children
with
upper
and
lower
respiratory
tract
infection
,
presenting
with
symptoms
including
croup
,
bronchiolitis
,
and
pneumonia
.

Unfortunately
,
there
are
currently
no
effective
antiviral
therapy
to
contain
HCoV-NL63
infection
.

CoV
genomes
encode
an
integral
viral
component
,
main
protease
(
M
pro
)
,
which
is
essential
for
viral
replication
through
proteolytic
processing
of
RNA
replicase
machinery
.

Due
to
the
sequence
and
structural
conservation
among
all
CoVs
,
M
pro
has
been
recognized
as
an
attractive
molecular
target
for
rational
anti-CoV
drug
design
.

Here
we
present
the
crystal
structure
of
HCoV-NL63
M
pro
in
complex
with
a
Michael
acceptor
inhibitor
N3
.

Structural
analysis
,
consistent
with
biochemical
inhibition
results
,
reveals
the
molecular
mechanism
of
enzyme
inhibition
at
the
highly
conservative
substrate-recognition
pocket
.

We
show
such
molecular
target
remains
unchanged
across
30
clinical
isolates
of
HCoV-NL63
strains
.

Through
comparative
study
with
M
pro
s
from
other
human
CoVs
(
including
the
deadly
SARS-CoV
and
MERS-CoV
)
and
their
related
zoonotic
CoVs
,
our
structure
of
HCoV-NL63
M
pro
provides
critical
insight
into
rational
development
of
wide
spectrum
antiviral
therapeutics
to
treat
infections
caused
by
human
CoVs
.

Coronaviruses
(
CoVs
)
are
a
diverse
group
of
enveloped
positive-strand
RNA
viruses
in
the
family
Coronaviridae
1,2
.

CoVs
have
been
identified
in
a
wide
variety
of
hosts
,
including
mammals
and
birds
,
and
are
shown
to
cause
a
number
of
respiratory
and
enteric
diseases
1,3,4
.

In
2003
,
the
global
epidemic
of
an
atypical
form
of
pneumonia
named
severe
acute
respiratory
syndrome
(
SARS
)
led
to
the
discovery
of
SARS-CoV
,
a
previously
unknown
CoV
,
as
the
etiologic
pathogen
5-8
.

Started
in
South
China
,
SARS
outbreak
quickly
resulted
in
more
than
800
deaths
worldwide
9
.

Patients
with
SARS-CoV
infection
developed
diffuse
alveolar
damage
with
the
potential
to
progress
into
acute
respiratory
distress
syndrome
and
eventually
death
10
.

Almost
10
years
later
,
another
previously
unknown
CoV
,
Middle
East
respiratory
syndrome
coronavirus
(
MERS-CoV
)
,
was
found
to
cause
a
new
epidemic
starting
in
the
Arabian
Peninsula
in
2012
[
11
]
[
12
]
[
13
]
.

MERS
infection
led
to
acute
pneumonia
and
renal
failure
,
with
mortality
rate
as
high
as
50
%
in
hospitalized
patients
14
,
15
.

In
addition
to
the
deadly
SARS-CoV
and
MERS-CoV
,
4
other
human
CoVs
have
been
identified
so
far
,
namely
HCoV-229E
,
HCoV-OC43
,
HCoV-NL63
,
and
HCoV-HKU1
,
which
are
known
to
cause
comparatively
mild
common
colds
9,16,17
.

According
to
their
genomic
sequences
,
these
6
HCoVs
are
further
classified
into
alphacoronavirus
genus
(
HCoV-229E
and
HCoV-NL63
)
and
betacoronavirus
genus
(
HCoV-OC43
,
HCoV-HKU1
,
SARS-CoV
,
and
MERS-CoV
)
12,18
.

The
emergence
of
CoV
infection
in
human
beings
are
believed
to
begin
with
zoonotic
transmission
from
animal
reservoirs
9
.

For
example
,
high
degree
of
genomic
sequence
similarity
was
shown
between
bovine
CoV
and
HCoV-OC43
,
suggesting
a
relatively
recent
animal-to-human
transmission
11
,
19
.

In
the
case
of
human
SARS-CoV
,
recent
studies
identified
several
SARS-like
bat
CoVs
with
over
95
%
genomic
sequence
identity
,
suggesting
bats
as
the
potential
zoonotic
reservoir
20-22
.

While
dromedary
camels
are
suspected
to
be
either
reservoir
or
vector
for
MERS
,
as
genomic
sequence
of
isolated
dromedary
MERS-CoV
was
found
identical
to
that
of
human
MERS-CoV
23-25
.

Human
coronavirus
NL63
(
HCoV-NL63
)
was
first
isolated
in
2004
from
a
7-month-old
child
suffering
from
bronchiolitis
and
conjunctivitis
in
the
Netherlands
16
.

HCoV-NL63
has
been
documented
to
circulate
in
human
population
worldwide
26-33
,
and
is
considered
the
causative
pathogen
for
up
to
10
%
of
all
respiratory
illnesses
34-37
.

Infected
patients
are
typically
young
children
with
upper
and
lower
respiratory
tract
infection
,
presenting
with
symptoms
including
croup
,
bronchiolitis
,
and
pneumonia
38,39
.

Nevertheless
,
infections
in
adults
have
also
been
reported
,
though
consequences
could
be
more
severe
in
those
with
compromised
immune
system
or
other
comorbidities
[
40
]
[
41
]
[
42
]
.

Similar
to
SARS-CoV
,
HCoV-NL63
also
uses
angiotensin-converting
enzyme
2
(
ACE2
)
as
the
receptor
for
cellular
entry
43
.

Full
genome
sequences
of
HCoV-NL63
have
been
determined
,
revealing
a
mosaic
structure
with
multiple
recombination
sites
which
indicate
that
possible
mutation
and
recombination
could
occur
when
co-infected
with
other
CoVs
44,45
.

Based
on
molecular
clock
analysis
,
HCoV-NL63
shares
common
ancestry
with
bat
alphacoronavirus
sequences
,
with
probable
divergence
563-822
years
ago
46
.

However
,
the
direct
bat
ancestor
of
HCoV-NL63
has
not
been
found
yet
47
.

Currently
there
are
no
approved
antiviral
drugs
or
vaccines
against
human
CoV
infection
,
though
several
compounds
have
been
investigated
in
pre-clinical
studies
9
.

From
a
public
health
perspective
,
no
effective
antiviral
strategy
is
available
in
face
of
future
CoV
emergence
,
potentially
transmitted
from
the
vast
and
mutable
zoonotic
reservoir
.

Previously
,
we
have
demonstrated
that
main
protease
(
M
pro
)
is
a
conserved
drug
target
throughout
the
subfamily
Coronavirinae
,
which
is
suitable
for
designing
wide-spectrum
inhibitors
48
,
49
.

The
5′
two-thirds
of
coronaviral
genome
is
consisted
of
open
reading
frame
1
(
ORF1
)
,
which
encodes
two
large
polypeptides
of
the
replicase
machinery
:
pp1a
,
and
through
ribosomal
frameshift
,
pp1ab
18
.

These
two
polypeptides
are
cotranslationally
cleaved
into
mature
nonstructural
proteins
(
Nsps
)
through
two
proteases
encoded
in
the
5′
region
of
ORF1
:
papain-like
protease
(
PLP
)
and
3C-like
protease
(
3CL
or
Nsp5
)
50,51
.

3CL
protease
is
more
commonly
known
as
M
pro
because
of
its
dominant
role
in
the
posttranslational
processing
of
the
replicase
polyprotein
.

The
M
pro
s
from
different
human
and
animal
CoVs
are
known
to
share
significant
homology
in
both
primary
amino
acid
sequence
and
3D
architecture
,
providing
a
strong
structural
basis
for
designing
wide-spectrum
anti-CoV
inhibitors
48,49,52-55
.

They
employ
a
similar
substrate-binding
pocket
,
usually
with
a
requirement
for
glutamine
at
P1
position
and
a
preference
for
leucine/methionine
at
P2
position
.

Interestingly
,
in
contrast
to
other
HCoVs
,
only
HCoV-NL63
and
HCoV-HKU1
exhibit
a
unique
substrate
preference
of
histidine
in
P1
position
at
the
cleavage
site
between
nsp13
and
nsp14
37,53
.

The
structural
and
pharmaceutical
significance
of
the
P1
position
preference
of
HCoV-NL63
M
pro
remains
to
be
addressed
.

Here
,
we
report
the
crystal
structure
of
HCoV-NL63
M
pro
in
complex
with
a
synthetic
peptidomimetic
inhibitor
,
N3
.

Structural
analysis
reveals
relative
conservation
at
the
P1
pocket
.

Through
comparison
with
M
pro
s
from
other
CoVs
,
we
provide
structural
insight
into
rational
drug
design
at
a
conserved
target
across
pathological
human
coronaviruses
and
their
related
zoonotic
counterparts
.

Severe
viral
pneumonia
is
associated
with
a
high
mortality
rate
.

However
,
due
to
the
vulnerability
of
critically
ill
patients
,
invasive
diagnostic
methods
should
be
performed
with
caution
in
the
intensive
care
unit
(
ICU
)
.

It
would
be
helpful
if
the
prevalence
,
risk
factors
,
and
clinical
impact
of
virus
detection
are
elucidated
.

We
evaluated
patients
with
severe
pneumonia
between
January
1
st
2008
and
December
31
st
2015
.

Reverse
transcription-polymerase
chain
reaction
(
RT-PCR
)
analysis
was
performed
for
8
respiratory
viruses
when
viral
pathogen
could
not
be
excluded
as
the
origin
of
severe
pneumonia
.

The
baseline
characteristics
,
laboratory
results
,
microbiological
findings
,
and
clinical
outcomes
of
the
patients
were
analyzed
.

Background
:
Attempts
to
develop
a
mechanistic
understanding
of
the
effects
of
environmental
estrogens
on
fish
are
increasingly
conducted
at
the
level
of
gene
expression
.

Appropriate
application
of
real-time
PCR
in
such
studies
requires
the
use
of
a
stably
expressed
'housekeeping
'
gene
as
an
internal
control
to
normalize
for
differences
in
the
amount
of
starting
template
between
samples
.

:
We
sought
to
identify
appropriate
genes
for
use
as
internal
controls
in
experimental
treatments
with
estrogen
by
analyzing
the
expression
of
eight
functionally
distinct
'housekeeping
'
genes
(

Our

critical

Background
:
Foot-and-mouth
disease
(
FMD
)
is
a
highly
contagious
disease
of
livestock
that
causes
severe
economic
loss
in
susceptible
cloven-hoofed
animals
.

Although
the
traditional
inactivated
vaccine
has
been
proved
effective
,
it
may
lead
to
a
new
outbreak
of
FMD
because
of
either
incomplete
inactivation
of
FMDV
or
the
escape
of
live
virus
from
vaccine
production
workshop
.

Thus
,
it
is
urgent
to
develop
a
novel
FMDV
vaccine
that
is
safer
,
more
effective
and
more
economical
than
traditional
vaccines
.

Methodology
and
Principal
Findings
:
A
recombinant
silkworm
baculovirus
Bm-P12A3C
which
contained
the
intact
P1-2A
and
3C
protease
coding
regions
of
FMDV
Asia
1/HNK/CHA/05
was
developed
.

Indirect
immunofluorescence
test
and
sandwich-ELISA
were
used
to
verify
that
Bm-P12A3C
could
express
the
target
cassette
.

Expression
products
from
silkworm
were
diluted
to
30
folds
and
used
as
antigen
to
immunize
cattle
.

Specific
antibody
was
induced
in
all
vaccinated
animals
.

After
challenge
with
virulent
homologous
virus
,
four
of
the
five
animals
were
completely
protected
,
and
clinical
symptoms
were
alleviated
and
delayed
in
the
remaining
one
.

Furthermore
,
a
PD
50
(
50
%
bovine
protective
dose
)
test
was
performed
to
assess
the
bovine
potency
of
the
subunit
vaccine
.

The
result
showed
the
subunit
vaccine
could
achieve
6.34
PD
50
per
dose
.

The
results
suggest
that
this
strategy
might
be
used
to
develop
the
new
subunit
FMDV
vaccine
.

Cyclic
adenosine
monophosphate
(
cAMP
)
is
a
crucial
intracellular
second
messenger
molecule
that
converts
extracellular
molecules
to
intracellular
signal
transduction
pathways
generating
cell-and
stimulus-specific
effects
.

Importantly
,
specific
phosphodiesterase
(
PDE
)
subtypes
control
the
amplitude
and
duration
of
cAMP-induced
physiological
processes
and
are
therefore
a
prominent
pharmacological
target
currently
used
in
a
variety
of
fields
.

Here
we
tested
the

,
which
have
been
used
for
more
than
2000
years
to
relieve
respiratory

.

Using
structural-functional
analysis
we
found
its
major
lignin
,
Forsynthin
,
acted
as
an
immunosuppressant
by
inhibiting
PDE4
in

cell
.

Moreover
,
several
novel
,
selective
small

derivatives
of
Forsythin
were
tested
in

and
in
murine
models
of
viral
and
bacterial
pneumonia
,
sepsis
and
cytokine-driven
systemic
inflammation
.

Thus
,
pharmacological
targeting
of
PDE4
may
be
a
promising
strategy
for
immune-related
disorders

Steroid-induced

)
is
a
disabling
,
aseptic

ischemic
disease
that
develops
following
steroid

.

The
pathogenesis
of
SONFH
is
unclear
,
so
the
early
diagnosis

treatment
for
this
disease
is
yet
to
be
established
.

The
purpose
of
the
present
study
was
to
identify
potential
biomarkers
for
SONFH
.

The
differential
expression
of
serum
proteins
from
patients
with
SONFH
and
healthy
volunteers
was
analyzed
by

.

The
protein
samples
were
labeled

subjected
to
isoelectric

two-dimensional
gel

.

The
resultant

that

these

Massive

of
leukocytes
in
the
pulmonary
microvasculature
is
a
major
triggering
event
of
the
syndrome
.

We
therefore
investigated
the
potential
role
of
leukocyte

in
the

of
leukocytes

essential
functional
roles
in
basic
biological

.

Endo/lysosomal

.

They
are
essential

.

Pathogens
can
produce
proteases
and
also
natural
inhibitors
to
subvert
the
host
immune
response
.

Several
pathogens
are
sensed
through
the
intracellular
pathogen
recognition

,

only
some
of
them

In

provide
an

on
the
most
recent

regarding
the
role
of
proteinases
and
their

in
the
initiation

.

In
the
past
decade
,
gold
nanoparticles
have
attracted
strong
interest
from
the
nanobiotechnological
community
owing
to
the
significant
progress
made
in
robust

easy-to-make
synthesis
technologies
,
in
surface
functionalization
,
and
in
promising
biomedical
applications
.

These
include
bioimaging

,
photothermal
treatment
of
tumors
,
and
targeted
delivery
of
various
biomolecular

chemical
cargos
.

For
the
last-named
application
,
gold
nanoparticles
should
be
properly
fabricated
to
deliver
the
cargo
into
the
targeted
cells
through
effective
endocytosis
.

In
this

,
we
discuss
recent
progress
in
understanding
the
selective
penetration
of
gold
nanoparticles
into
immune

.

The
interaction
of
gold
nanoparticles
with
immune
cell

is
discussed
.

As

from
other
published

,
we
present
a
summary
of
the
immunological
properties
of
gold

.

This

also
summarizes
what
is
known
about
the
application
of
gold

as
an
antigen

in

For

of
the
above
topics
,
the
basic
principles
,
recent
advances
,

Thus

presents
a
detailed
analysis
of
data
on

of
gold

Emphasis
is
placed
on
the

by
using
gold

and
adjuvant
properties
of

.

Specifically
,
we
start
our
discussion
with
current
data
on

of
various
gold
nanoparticles
with
immune

.

The

to
improve

by
using
gold

.

Finally
,
we
describe
what

about

.

In
the
Conclusion

,
we

of

data
and
some

and
perspectives
.

Human
herpesvirus
type
6B
(
HHV-6B
)
is
a
strong
inducer
of
IFN-alpha
and
has
the
capacity
to
promote
Th1
responses
and
block
Th2
responses
in
vitro
.

In
this
study
we
addressed
whether
inactivated
HHV-6B
can
also
induce
IFN
lambda
responses
and
to
what
extent
interferons
alpha
and
lambda
affect
Th1/Th2
polarization
.

We
show
that
inactivated
HHV-6B
induced
IFN-lambda1
(
IL-29
)
but
not
IFN-lambda2
(
IL-28A
)
responses
in
plasmacytoid
DC
and
that
this
induction
was
mediated
through
TLR9
.

We
have
previously
shown
that
HHV-6B
promotes
Th1
responses
and
blocks
Th2
responses
in
both
humans
and
mice
.

We
now
show
that
neutralization
of
IFN-alpha
but
not
IFN-lambda1
blocked
the
HHV-6B-induced
enhancement
of
Th1
responses
in
MLR
,
but
did
not
affect
the
HHV-6-induced
dampening
of
Th2
responses
.

Similarly
,
blockage
of
TLR9
counteracted
HHV-6Bs
effects
on
the
Th1/Th2
balance
.

In
addition
,
IFN-alpha
but
not
IFN-lambda1
promoted
IFN-gamma
production
and
blocked
IL-5
and
IL-13
production
in
purified
CD4+
T-cells
.

The
lack
of
effect
of
IFN-lambda1
correlated
with
the
absence
of
the
IFN-lambda
receptor
IL-28Ralfa
chain
on
the
cell
surface
of
both
resting
and
activated
CD4+
T-cells
.

We
conclude
that
inactivated
HHV-6B
is
a
strong
inducer
of
IFN-lambda1
in
plasmacytoid
DC
and
that
this
induction
is
TLR9dependent
.

However
,
human
CD4+
T-cells
do
not
express
the
IFN-lambda
receptor
and
are
refractory
to
IFN-lambda1
treatment
.

The
HHV-6B-induced
alterations
in
the
Th1/Th2
balance
are
instead
mediated
mainly
through
TLR9
and
IFNalpha
.

We
describe
the

which
current
conventional

The
delta
smelt
(
Hypomesus
transpacificus
)
is
a
pelagic
fish
species
listed
as
endangered
under
both
the
USA
Federal
and
Californian
State
Endangered
Species
Acts
and
considered
an
indicator
of
ecosystem
health
in
its
habitat
range
,
which
is
limited
to
the
Sacramento-San
Joaquin
estuary
in
California
,
USA
.

Anthropogenic
contaminants
are
one
of
multiple
stressors
affecting
this
system
,
and
among
them
,
current-use
insecticides
are
of
major
concern
.

Interrogative
tools
are
required
to
successfully
monitor
effects
of
contaminants
on
the
delta
smelt
,
and
to
research
potential
causes
of
population
decline
in
this
species
.

We
have
created
a
microarray
to
investigate
genome-wide
effects
of
potentially
causative
stressors
,
and
applied
this
tool
to
assess
effects
of
the
pyrethroid
insecticide
esfenvalerate
on
larval
delta
smelt
.

Selected
genes
were
further
investigated
as
molecular
biomarkers
using
quantitative
PCR
analyses
.

Results
:
Exposure
to
esfenvalerate
affected
swimming
behavior
of
larval
delta
smelt
at
concentrations
as
low
as
0.0625
μg.L
-1
,
and
significant
differences
in
expression
were
measured
in
genes
involved
in
neuromuscular
activity
.

Alterations
in
the
expression
of
genes
associated
with
immune
responses
,
along
with
apoptosis
,
redox
,
osmotic
stress
,
detoxification
,
and
growth
and
development
appear
to
have
been
invoked
by
esfenvalerate
exposure
.

Swimming
impairment
correlated
significantly
with
expression
of
aspartoacylase
(
ASPA
)
,
an
enzyme
involved
in
brain
cell
function
and
associated
with
numerous
human

.

Selected
genes
were
investigated
for
their
use
as
molecular
biomarkers
,
and
strong
links
were
determined
between
measured

Being
a
neurodegenerative
disorder
,
Alzheimer
's
disease
(
AD
)
is
the
one
of
the
most
terrible
diseases
.

And
acetylcholinesterase
(
AChE
)
is
considered
as
an
important
target
for
treating
AD
.

Acetylcholinesterase
inhibitors
(
AChEI
)
are
considered
to
be
one
of
the
effective
drugs
for
the
treatment
of
AD
.

The
aim
of
this
study
is
to
find
a
novel
potential
AChEI
as
a
drug
for
the
treatment
of
AD
.

In
this
study
,
instead
of
using
the
synthetic
compounds
,
we
used
those
extracted
from
plants
to
investigate
the
interaction
between
floribundiquinone
B
(
FB
)
and
AChE
by
means
of
both

,
ultraviolet-visible
(

)
absorption

,
circular
dichroism
(
CD
)
and
the
theoretical
approaches
such
as
molecular
docking
.

The
findings
reported
here
have
provided
many
useful
clues
and
hints
for
designing
more
effective

Background
:
China
has
become
the
world
's
second
largest
healthcare
market
based
on
a
recent
report
by
the
World
Health
Organization
.

Eventhough
China
achieved
universal
health
insurance
coverage
in
2011
,
representing
the
largest
expansion
of
insurance
coverage
in
human
history
achieved
;
health
inequality
remains
endemic
in
China
.

Lessons
from
the
effect
of
market
crisis
on
health
equity
in
Europe
and
other
places
has
reignited
interest
in
exploring
the
potential
healthcare
market
aberrations
that
can
trigger
distributive
injustice
in
healthcare
resource
allocation
among
China
's
provinces
.

Recently
,
many
healthcare
investors
in
China
have
become
more
concerned
about
capital
preservation
,
and
are
responding
by
abandoning
long
term
investments
strategies
in
healthcare
.

This
investment
withdrawal
en
mass
is
perceived
to
be
influenced
by
herding
tendencies
and
can
trigger
or
consolidate
endemic
health
inequality
.

Methods
:
Our
study
simultaneously
employs
four
testing
models
(
two
state
spaced
models
and
two
return
dispersion
models
)
to
establish
the
existence
of
procyclical
(
herding
)
behavior
among
the
stocks
and
its
health
equity
implications
.

These
are
applied
to
a
large
set
of
data
to
compare
and
contrast
results
of
herd
formation
among
investors
in
fourteen
healthcare
sectors
in
China
.

Results
:
The
study
reveals
that
apart
from
the
cross
sectional
standard
deviation
(
CSSD
)
model
,
the
remaining
two
models
and
our
augmented
state
space
model
yields
significant
evidence
of
herding
in
all
subsectors
of
the
healthcare
market
.

We
also
find
that
the
herding
effect
is
more
prominent
during
down
movements
of
the
market
.

Conclusion
:
Herding
behavior
may
lead
to
contemporaneous
loss
of
investor
confidence
and
capital
withdrawal
and
thereby
deprive
the
healthcare
sector
of
the
much
needed
capital
for
expansion
.

Thus
there
may
be
obvious
delay
in
efforts
to
bridge
the
gap
in
access
to
healthcare
facilities
,
medical
support
services
,
medical
supplies
,
pharmaceuticals
,
biotechnology
,
diagnostic
substances
,
medical
laboratory
and
advanced
medical
equipment
across
China
.

Moreover
,
a
potential
crash
in
the
healthcare
market
is
possible
in
the
healthcare
sector
as
a
result
of
persistent
herding
tendencies
among
investors
and
that
may
have
more
damaging
consequences
for
health
inequality
in
China
.

The
COVID-19
pandemic

modern
radiation
oncology
.

At
University
Hospitals
,
we
have
a
mandate
to
offer
high-end
treatments
to
all
cancer
patients
.

However
,
in
times
of
crisis
we
must
learn
to
prioritize
resources
,
especially
personnel
.

Compromising
oncological
outcome
will
blur
all
statistics
,
therefore
all
measures
must
be
taken
with
great
caution
.

Communication
with
our
neighboring
countries
,
within
societies
and
between
departments
can
help
meet
the
challenge
.

Here
,
we
report
on
our
learning
system

The
lion
Panthera
leo
is
one
of
the
world
's
most
charismatic
carnivores
and
is
one
of
Africa
's
key
predators
.

Here
,
we
used
a
large
dataset
from
357
lions
comprehending
1.13
megabases
of
sequence
data
and
genotypes
from
22
microsatellite
loci
to
characterize
its
recent
evolutionary
history

Patterns
of
molecular
genetic
variation
in
multiple
maternal
(
mtDNA
)
,
paternal
(
Y-chromosome
)
,
and
biparental
nuclear
(
nDNA
)
genetic
markers
were
compared
with
patterns
of
sequence
and
subtype
variation
of
the
lion
feline
immunodeficiency
virus
(
FIV
Ple
)
,
a
lentivirus
analogous
to
human
immunodeficiency
virus
(
HIV
)
.

In
spite
of
the
ability
of
lions
to
disperse
long
distances
,
patterns
of
lion
genetic
diversity
suggest
substantial
population
subdivision
(
mtDNA
W
ST
=
0.92
;
nDNA
F
ST
=
0.18
)
,
and
reduced
gene
flow
,
which
,
along
with
large
differences
in
seroprevalence
of
six
distinct
FIV
Ple
subtypes
among
lion
populations
,
refute
the
hypothesis
that
African
lions
consist
of
a
single
panmictic
population
.

Our
results
suggest
that
extant
lion
populations
derive
from
several
Pleistocene
refugia
in
East
and
Southern
Africa
(
,324,000-169,000
years
ago
)
,
which
expanded
during
the
Late
Pleistocene
(
,100,000
years
ago
)
into
Central
and
North
Africa
and
into
Asia
.

During
the
Pleistocene/Holocene
transition
(
,14,000-7,000
years
)
,
another
expansion
occurred
from
southern
refugia
northwards
towards
East
Africa
,
causing
population
interbreeding
.

In
particular
,
lion
and
FIV
Ple
variation
affirms
that
the
large
,
well-studied
lion
population
occupying
the
greater
Serengeti
Ecosystem
is
derived
from
three
distinct
populations
that
admixed
recently

The
porcine
epidemic
diarrhea
virus
(
PEDV
)
that
emerged
and
spread
throughout
Taiwan
in
2014
triggered
significant
concern
in
the
country
's
swine
industry
.

Acknowledging
the
absence
of
a
thorough
investigation
at
the
geographic
level
,
we
used
2014
outbreak
sequence
information
from
the
Taiwan
government
's
open
access
databases
plus
GenBank
records
to
analyze
PEDV
dissemination
among
Taiwanese
pig
farms
.

Genetic
sequences
,
locations
,
and
dates
of
identified
PEDV-positive
cases
were
used
to
assess
spatial
,
temporal
,
clustering
,
GIS
,
and
phylogeographic
factors
affecting
PEDV
dissemination
.

Our
conclusion
is
that
S
gene
sequences
from
2014
PEDV-positive
clinical
samples
collected
in
Taiwan
were
part
of
the
same
Genogroup
2
identified
in
the
US
in
2013
.

According
to
phylogenetic
and
phylogeographic
data
,
viral
strains
collected
in
different
areas
were
generally
independent
of
each
other
,
with
certain
clusters
identified
across
different
communities
.

Data
from
GIS
and
multiple
potential
infection
factors
were
used
to
pinpoint
cluster
dissemination
in
areas
with
large
numbers
of
swine
farms
in
southern
Taiwan
.

The
data
indicate
that
the
2014
Taiwan
PEDV
epidemic
resulted
from
the
spread
of
multiple
strains
,
with
strong
correlations
identified
with
pig
farm
numbers
and
sizes
(
measured
as
animal
concentrations
)
,

has
been
increasing
year-on-year

Optimizing
the
use
of
blood
transfusions
requires
an
understanding
of
the
physiology
of
burn
injury
,
the
risks
and
benefits
of
blood
transfusion
,
and
the
indications
for
transfusion
.

Age
also
plays
a
role
in
determining
blood
transfusion
requirements
.

Children
in
particular
have
a
different
physiology
than
adults
,
which
needs
to
be
considered
prior
to
transfusing
blood
and
blood

.

This
article
describes
the
physiologic
differences
between
children
and
adults
in
general
and
after
burn
injury
and
describes
how
these

Background
:
The
dendritic
cell-specific
intercellular
adhesion
molecule
3
grabbing
non-integrin
(
DC-SIGN
)
is
an
important
pathogen
recognition
receptor
of
the
innate
immune
system
.

DC-SIGN
promoter
variants
play
important
role
in
the
susceptibility
to
various
infectious
diseases
.

Nasopharyngeal
carcinoma
(
NPC
)
is
a
malignancy
that
is
common
in
southern
China
and
whether
DC-SIGN
promoter
variants
have
effects
on
susceptibility
to
NPC
is
still
unknown
.

The
aim
of
this
study
is
to
ascertain
the
potential
involvement
of
DC-SIGN
promoter
single
nucleotide
polymorphisms
(
SNPs
)
in
NPC
susceptibility
.

Methods
:
We
conducted
a
case
control
study
based
on
Cantonese
population
including
444
NPC
patients
and
464
controls
matched
on
age
and
sex
.

The
1041
bp
of
DC-SIGN
promoter
region
was
directly
sequenced
for
all
samples
.

Sequence
alignment
and
SNP
search
were
inspected
using
DNAStar
analysis
programs
and
haplotype
frequencies
were
estimated
in
Haploview
V
4.0
.

The
associations
between
the
SNPs
and
the
risk
of
NPC
were
analyzed
using
chi-square
test
and
non-conditional
logistic
regression
analysis
with
SPSS
13.0
software
.

Results
:
A
total
of
six
variants
were
observed
in
the
DC-SIGN
promoter
region
and
DC-SIGN
-139

.

Haplotype

revealed
that

significantly
associated
with
protection
against
NPC
(

Conclusions
:
Our
study
indicated
that
DC-SIGN
promoter
variants
appear
to
be
involved
in
the
susceptibility
to

Little
is
known
about
the
biology
of
the
emerging
human
group
c
betacoronavirus
,
Middle
East
Respiratory
Syndrome
coronavirus
(
MERS-CoV
)
.

Because
coronavirus
spike
glycoproteins
(
S
)
mediate
virus
entry
,
affect
viral
host
range
,
and
elicit
neutralizing
antibodies
,
analyzing
the
functions
of
MERS-CoV
S
protein
is
a
high
research
priority
.

MERS-CoV
S
on
lentivirus
pseudovirions
mediated
entry
into
a
variety
of
cell
types
including
embryo
cells
from
New
World
Eptesicus
fuscus
bats
.

Surprisingly
,
a
polyclonal
antibody
to
the
S
protein
of
MHV
,
a
group
a
murine
betacoronavirus
,
cross-reacted
in
immunoblots
with
the
S2
domain
of
group
c
MERS-CoV
spike
protein
.

MERS
pseudovirions
released
from
293T
cells
contained
only
uncleaved
S
,
and
pseudovirus
entry
was
blocked
by
lysosomotropic
reagents
NH
4
Cl
and
bafilomycin
and
inhibitors
of
cathepsin
L.
However
,
when
MERS
pseudovirions
with
uncleaved
S
protein
were
adsorbed
at
4°C
to
Vero
E6
cells
,
brief
trypsin
treatment
at
neutral
pH
triggered
virus
entry
at
the
plasma
membrane
and
syncytia
formation
.

When
293T
cells
producing
MERS
pseudotypes
co-expressed
serine
proteases
TMPRSS-2
or
-4
,
large
syncytia
formed
at
neutral
pH
,
and
the
pseudovirions
produced
were
non-infectious
and
deficient
in
S
protein
.

These
experiments
show
that
if
S
protein
on
MERS
pseudovirions
is
uncleaved
,
then
viruses
enter
by
endocytosis
in
a
cathepsin
L-dependent
manner
,
but
if
MERS-CoV
S
is
cleaved
,
either
during
virus
maturation
by
serine
proteases
or
on
pseudovirions
by
trypsin
in
extracellular
fluids
,
then
viruses
enter
at
the
plasma
membrane
at
neutral
pH
and
cause
massive
syncytia
formation
even
in
cells
that
express
little
or
no
MERS-CoV
receptor
.

Thus
,
whether
MERS-CoV
enters
cells
within
endosomes
or
at
the
plasma
membrane
depends
upon
the
host
cell
type
and
tissue
,
and
is
determined
by
the
location
of
host
proteases
that
cleave
the
viral
spike
glycoprotein
and
activate
membrane
fusion

The
aim
of
the
present
study
was
to
formulate
poly
(
lactide-co-glycolide
)
(
PLGA
)
nanoparticles
loaded
with
18-β-glycyrrhetinic
acid
(
GLA
)
with
appropriate
physicochemical
properties
and
antimicrobial
activity
.

GLA
loaded
PLGA
nanoparticles
were
prepared
with
different
drug
to
polymer
ratios
,
acetone
contents
and
sonication
times
and
the
antibacterial
activity
of
the
developed
nanoparticles
was
examined
against
different
gram-negative
and
gram-positive
bacteria
.

The
antibacterial
effect
was
studied
using
serial
dilution
technique
to
determine
the
minimum
inhibitory
concentration
of
nanoparticles
.

Results
demonstrated
that
physicochemical
properties
of
nanoparticles
were
affected
by
the
above
mentioned
parameters
where
nanoscale
size
particles
ranging
from
175
to
212
nm
were
achieved
.

The
highest
encapsulation
efficiency
(
53.2
±
2.4
%
)
was
obtained
when
the
ratio
of
drug
to
polymer
was
1:4
.

Zeta
potential
of
the
developed
nanoparticles
was
fairly
negative
(
-11±1.5
)
.

In-vitro
release
profile
of
nanoparticles
showed
two
phases
:
an
initial
phase
of
burst
release
for
10
h
followed
by
a
slow
release
pattern
up
to
the
end
.

The
antimicrobial
results
revealed
that
the
nanoparticles
were
more
effective
than
pure
GLA
against
P.
aeuroginosa
,
S.
aureus
and
S.
epidermidis
.

This
improvement
in
antibacterial
activity
of
GLA
loaded
nanoparticles
when
compared
to
pure
GLA
may
be
related
to
higher
nanoparticles
penetration
into
infected
cells
and
a
higher
amount
of
GLA
delivery
in
its
site
of
action
.

Herein
,
it
was
shown
that
GLA
loaded
PLGA
nanoparticles
displayed
appropriate
physicochemical
properties
as
well
as
an
improved
antimicrobial
effect
.

Like
all
somatic
tissues
,
the
human
immune
system
changes
with
age
.

This
is
believed
to
result
in
an
increased
frequency
of
,
and
susceptibility
to
,
infectious
disease
and
to
contribute
to
a
wide
range
of
non-communicable
age-associated
diseases
in
later
life
,
especially
cancer
,
cardiovascular
disease
,
and
autoimmunity
.

The
majority
of
studies
addressing
immune
ageing
has
been
cross-sectional
,
but
limited
longitudinal
studies
are
contributing
to
a
better
understanding
of
age-associated
changes
,
as
opposed
to
differences
,
and
their
clinical
relevance
.

However
,
intriguing
differences
are
emerging
that
implicate
highly
context-dependent
immune
ageing
processes
,
mitigating
against
current
generalisations
concerning
human
immunosenescence
and
indicating
the
necessity
for
detailed
comparisons
of
different
populations
,
even
those
that
would
appear
quite
similar
at
first
glance

enormous
genomic
potential
in
the

To

,
a

mM
NaCl
for
30
min

The
lysate
was
then
loaded
on
a
20

sucrose
cushion
prepared
in
a
buffer
containing
20mM
HEPES-Na
at
pH
7.6
and
150
mM
NaCl
(
HEPES
buffer
)
.

The
RNPs
were
pelleted
by
centrifugation
for
30
min
at
21,130
×
g.
To
remove
the

the

Overlapping
genes
represent
a
fascinating
evolutionary
puzzle
,
since
they
encode
two
functionally
unrelated
proteins
from
the
same
DNA
sequence
.

They
originate
by
a
mechanism
of
overprinting
,
in
which
point
mutations
in
an
existing
frame
allow
the
expression
(
the
``
birth
''
)
of
a
completely
new
protein
from
a
second
frame
.

In
viruses
,
in
which
overlapping
genes
are
abundant
,
these
new
proteins
often
play
a
critical
role
in
infection
,
yet
they
are
frequently
overlooked
during
genome
annotation
.

This
results
in
erroneous
interpretation
of
mutational
studies
and
in
a
significant
waste
of
resources
.

Therefore
,
overlapping
genes
need
to
be
correctly
detected
,
especially
since
they
are
now
thought
to
be
abundant
also
in
eukaryotes
.

Developing
better
detection
methods
and
conducting
systematic
evolutionary
studies
require
a
large
,
reliable
benchmark
dataset
of
known
cases
.

We
thus
assembled
a
highquality
dataset
of
80
viral
overlapping
genes
whose
expression
is
experimentally
proven
.

Many
of
them
were
not
present
in
databases
.

We
found
that
overall
,
overlapping
genes
differ
significantly
from
non-overlapping
genes
in
their
nucleotide
and
amino
acid
composition
.

In
particular
,
the
proteins
they
encode
are
enriched
in
high-degeneracy
amino
acids
and
depleted
in
low-degeneracy
ones
,
which
may
alleviate
the
evolutionary
constraints
acting
on
overlapping
genes
.

Principal
component
analysis
revealed
that
the
vast
majority
of
overlapping
genes
follow
a
similar
composition
bias
,
despite
their
heterogeneity
in
length
and
function
.

Six
proven
mammalian
overlapping
genes
also
followed
this
bias
.

We
propose
that
this
apparently
near-universal
composition
bias
may
either
favour
the
birth
of
overlapping
genes
,
or/and
result
from
selection
pressure
acting
on
them
.

Plasmacytoid
dendritic
cell
(
pDC
)
-mediated
protection
against
cytopathic
virus
infection
involves
various
molecular
,
cellular
,
tissue-scale
,
and
organism-scale
events
.

In
order
to
better
understand
such
multiscale
interactions
,
we
have
implemented
a
systems
immunology
approach
focusing
on
the
analysis
of
the
structure
,
dynamics
and
operating
principles
of
virus-host
interactions
which
constrain
the
initial
spread
of
the
pathogen
.

Using
high-resolution
experimental
data
sets
coming
from
the
well-described
mouse
hepatitis
virus
(
MHV
)
model
,
we
first
calibrated
basic
modules
including
MHV
infection
of
its
primary
target
cells
,
i.e
.

pDCs
and
macrophages
(
Mws
)
.

These
basic
building
blocks
were
used
to
generate
and
validate
an
integrative
mathematical
model
for
in
vivo
infection
dynamics
.

Parameter
estimation
for
the
system
indicated
that
on
a
per
capita
basis
,
one
infected
pDC
secretes
sufficient
type
I
IFN
to
protect
10
3
to
10
4
Mws
from
cytopathic
viral
infection
.

This
extremely
high
protective
capacity
of
pDCs
secures
the
spleen
's
capability
to
function
as
a
'sink
'
for
the
virus
produced
in
peripheral
organs
such
as
the
liver
.

Furthermore
,
our
results
suggest
that
the
pDC
population
in
spleen
ensures
a
robust
protection
against
virus
variants
which
substantially
down-modulate
IFN
secretion
.

However
,
the
ability
of
pDCs
to
protect
against
severe
disease
caused
by
virus
variants
exhibiting
an
enhanced
liver
tropism
and
higher
replication
rates
appears
to
be
rather
limited
.

Taken
together
,
this
systems
immunology
analysis
suggests
that
antiviral
therapy
against
cytopathic
viruses
should
primarily
limit
viral
replication
within
peripheral
target
organs
.

Background
:
Enterovirus
71
(
EV71
)
is
one
of
the
major
etiological
pathogens
of
hand
,
foot
and
mouth
disease
(
HFMD
)
and
can
cause
severe
cerebral
and
pulmonary
complications
and
even
fatality
.

MicroRNAs
(
miRNAs
)
,
a
class
of
small
non-coding
RNA
molecules
,
play
an
important
role
in
post-transcriptional
regulation
of
gene
expression
and
thereby
influencing
various
physiological
and
pathological
processes
.

Increasing
evidence
suggests
that
miRNAs
act
as
key
effector
molecules
in
the
complicated
pathogen-host
interactions
.

However
,
the
roles
of
miRNAs
in
EV71
infection
and
pathogenesis
are
not
well
understood
.

Methods
:
To
identify
special
miRNAs
involved
in
EV71
infection
,
a
microarray
assay
was
performed
to
study
the
expression
pattern
of
miRNAs
in
EV71-infected
human
rhabdomyosarcoma
cells
(
RD
cells
)
and
uninfected
RD
cells
.

We
further
predicted
the
putative
target
genes
for
the
dysregulated
miRNAs
using
the
online
bioinformatic
algorithms
(
TargetScan
,
miRanda
and
PicTar
)
and
carried
out
functional
annotation
including
GO
enrichment
and
KEGG
pathway
analysis
for
miRNA
predicted
targets
.

Then
,
the
results
of
microarray
were
further
confirmed
by
quantitative
RT-PCR
.

Results
:
Totally
,
45
differentially
expressed
miRNAs
ware
identified
by
microarray
,
among
which
36
miRNAs
were
up-regulated
and
9
were
down-regulated
.

7166
predicted
target
genes
for
the
dysregulated
miRNAs
were
revealed
by
using
TargetScan
in
conjunction
with
miRanda
and
PicTar
.

The
GO
annotation
suggested
that
predicted
targets
of
miRNAs
were
enriched
into
the
category
of
signal
transduction
,
regulation
of
transcription
,
metabolic
process
,
protein
phosphorylation
,
apoptotic
process
and
immune
response
.

KEGG
pathway
analysis
suggested
that
these
predicted
target
genes
were
involved
in
many
important
pathways
,
mainly
including
endocytosis
and
focal
adhesion
,
MAPK
signaling
pathway
,
hypertrophic
cardiomyopathy
,
melanogenesis
and
ErbB
signaling
pathway
.

The
expression
levels
of
8
most
differentially
up-regulated
miRNAs
and
3
most
differentially
down-regulated
miRNAs
were
confirmed
by
qRT-PCR
.

The
expressions
of
hsa-miR-4530
,
hsa-miR-4492
,
hsa-miR-6125
,
hsa-miR-494-3p
,
hsa-miR-638
,
hsa-miR-6743-5p
,
hsa-miR-4459
and
hsa-miR-4443
detected
by
qRT-PCR
were
consistent
with
the
microarray
data
.

Conclusion
:
These
results
might
extend
our
understanding
to
the
regulatory
mechanism
of
miRNAs
underlying
the
pathogenesis
of
EV71
infection
,
thus
strengthening
the
preventative
and
therapeutic
strategies
of
HFMD
caused
by
EV71
.

Background
:
Asthma
is
a
major
public
health
problem
with
a
huge
social
and
economic
burden
affecting
300
million
people
worldwide
.

Viral
respiratory
infections
are
the
major
cause
of
acute
asthma
exacerbations
and
may
contribute
to
asthma
inception
in
high
risk
young
children
with
susceptible
genetic
background
.

Acute
exacerbations
are
associated
with
decreased
lung
growth
or
accelerated
loss
of
lung
function
and
,
as
such
,
add
substantially
to
both
the
cost
and
morbidity
associated
with
asthma
.

Discussion
:
While
the
importance
of
preventing
viral
infection
is
well
established
,
preventive
strategies
have
not
been
well
explored
.

Good
personal
hygiene
,
hand-washing
and
avoidance
of
cigarette
smoke
are
likely
to
reduce
respiratory
viral
infections
.

Eating
a
healthy
balanced
diet
,
active
probiotic
supplements
and
bacterial-derived
products
,
such
as
OM-85
,
may
reduce
recurrent
infections
in
susceptible
children
.

There
are
no
practical
anti-viral
therapies
currently
available
that
are
suitable
for
widespread
use
.

Summary
:
Hand
hygiene
is
the
best
measure
to
prevent
the
common
cold
.

A

IAV
and
the
host
Crm1-dependent
nuclear
export
machinery
requires
further
exploration
.

Recently
,
Chase
and
collaborators
showed
that
the
interaction
between
vRNPs
and
the
nuclear
export
machinery
takes
place
in
dense
chromatin
domains
that
allow
IAV
to
``
snatch
''
Crm1-RanGTP
nuclear
export
complexes
to
the
detriment
of
cellular
substrates
13
.

These
results
,
together
with
other
observations
,
highlight
the
involvement
of
host
nuclear
compartmentalization
and
chromatin
territories
in
regulating
nuclear
traffic
of
IAV
vRNPs
[

15
]
[
16
]
[

]
.

Several
investigations
,
including
ours
,
have
revealed
that
IAV
induce
a
strong
remodeling
of
nuclear
architecture
with
marked
modifications
of
the
nucleoli
ultrastructure
and
compartments
3,17-20
.

The
nucleolus
,
known
as
the
site
of
ribosome
biogenesis
,
is
also
a
sensor
of
cellular
stresses
and
is
involved
in
several
cellular
pathways
,
such
as
cell-cycle
regulation
or
apoptosis
21-23
.

Several
DNA
and
RNA
viruses
,
including
cytoplasmic
viruses
are
known
to
induce
nucleolar
alterations
that
contribute
towards
optimal
infection
24-26
.

In
the
context
of
IAV
,
their
interplay
with
nucleolus
and
selective
interactions
with
several
nucleolar
components
appears
to
be
decisive
in
the
outcome
of
infection
17
,
20
.

Ozawa
and
colleagues
demonstrated
that
dynamic
nucleolar
localization
of
NP
is
functionally
significant
by
contributing
to
efficient
viral
replication
and
transcription
27
.

Moreover
,
different
studies
have
demonstrated
a
subtype
dependent
interaction
between
viral
non-structural
protein
(
NS1
)
and
cellular
nucleolin
,
suggesting
a
role
of
the
nucleolar
targeting
functions
of
NS1
in
IAV
pathogenesis
28
,
29
.

Proteomics-based
approaches
have
revealed
changes
in
the
nucleolar
proteome
of
IAV
infected
cells
5,30
and
identified
several
nucleolar
components
,
such
as
nucleolin
,
nucleophosmin
(
B23
)
and
ribosomal
proteins
,
as
putative
interactants
of
reconstituted
IAV
vRNPs
7
.

In
addition
,
high-throughput
RNAi
approaches
have
highlighted
the
functional
requirement
of
several
of
these
nucleolar
components
in
viral
replication
31-33
.

Nucleolin
is
a
multifunctional
protein
that
contributes
extensively
to
DNA
and
RNA
regulatory
mechanisms
,
including
ribosome
biogenesis
,
chromatin
remodeling
,
mRNA
stability
and
translation
,
nuclear
export
of
RNA
and
protein
complexes
,
and
microRNA
processing
34
,
35
.

In
this
way
,
nucleolin
takes
part
in
several
cellular
functions
,
such
as
gene
silencing
,
senescence
,
cell
proliferation
and
growth
23,35-37
,
and
continuously
shuttles
between
nucleolar/nuclear
compartments
and
the
cytoplasm
up
to
the
cell
surface
38,39
.

Moreover
,
through
its
ability
to
associate
with
diverse
target
RNAs
,
nucleolin
is
implicated
in
various
pathological
processes
,
particularly
cancer
and
viral
infection
40
.

In
this
context
,
different
functional
interactions
with
nucleolin
have
been
described
for
several
DNA
viruses
,
such
as
poliovirus
41
,
adenovirus
42
,
HSV
43
,
44
or
CMV
45
,
46
,
and
several
RNA
viruses
,
such
as
hepatitis
C
and
delta
viruses
47,48
,
coronavirus
49
,
hPIV-3
50
,
papillomavirus
HPV9
51
,
Crimean-Congo
hemorrhagic
fever
virus
52
,
HIV1
53
,
noroviruses
54
and
notably
the
infectious
salmon
anemia
virus
(
ISAV
)
which
belongs
to
the
family
Orthomyxoviridae
,
as
IAV
55
.

Altogether
,
these
studies
highlight
nucleolin
as
a
key
interacting
factor
that
is
crucial
,
in
some
cases
,
for
viral
replication
and
involved
in
nucleo-cytoplasmic
export
of
viral
genome
or
viral
egress
44
.

At
first
,
we
observed
the
dynamic
redistribution
of
nucleolin
from
a
nucleolar
to
a
very
specific
nuclear
polarized
pattern
during
infection
.

The
aim
of
this
study
was
therefore
to
investigate
the
functional
relationship
between
IAV
and
nucleolin
with
regards
to
the
nuclear
traffic
of
vRNPs
and
their
targeting
to
the
dense
chromatin
compartment
13
and
in
the
context
of
the
viral
remodeling
of
the
host
nuclear
architectures
17,20
.

We
first
characterized
NP
,
the
main
component
of
IAV
vRNP
,
as
co-localizing
and
interacting
with
endogenous
nucleolin
during
infection
.

Moreover
,
using
cell
fractionation
and
RNAi
approaches
,
we
suggest
that
nucleolin
contributes
to
efficient
vRNP
trafficking
and
viral
replication
.

Based
on
our
results
,
we
propose
nucleolin
as
an
essential
host
factor
for
the
chromatin
targeting
of
the
nucleocytoplasmic
export
complex
of
vRNPs
during
infection
.

Respiratory
viruses
cause
infections
of
the
upper
or
lower
respiratory
tract
and
they
are
responsible
for
the
common
cold-the
most
prevalent
disease
in
the
world
.

In
many
cases
the
common
cold
results
in
severe
illness
due
to
complications
,
such
as
fever
or
pneumonia
.

Children
,
old
people
,
and
immunosuppressed
patients
are
at
the
highest
risk
and
require
fast
diagnosis
and
therapeutic
intervention
.

However
,
the
availability
and
efficiencies
of
existing
therapeutic
approaches
vary
depending
on
the
virus
.

Investigation
of
the
pathologies
that
are
associated
with
infection
by
respiratory
viruses
will
be
paramount
for
diagnosis
,
treatment
modalities
,
and
the
development
of
new
therapies
.

Changes
in
redox
homeostasis
in
infected
cells
are
one
of
the
key
events
that
is
linked
to
infection
with
respiratory
viruses
and
linked
to
inflammation
and
subsequent
tissue
damage
.

Our
review
summarizes
current
knowledge
on
changes
to
redox
homeostasis
,
as
induced
by
the
different
respiratory
viruses

Markers
of
redox
misbalance
in
blood
and
tissues
are
often
taken
into
account
in
the
pathology
of
various
diseases
.

Chronic
viral
hepatitis
B
and
C
are
generally
associated
with
oxidative
stress
,
and
levels
of
ROS
and
oxidized
metabolites
correlate
with
the
severity
of
liver
damage
and
with
the
risk
of
the
development
of
related
pathologies-fibrosis
and
hepatocellular
carcinoma
[

]
.

Moreover
,
currently
redox
biology
pays
much
attention
to
localization
of
ROS
sources
,
since
local
changes
in
ROS
levels
may
influence
signaling
pathways
by
activating
``
redox
switches
''
[

.

In
lungs
,
redox
homeostasis
is
crucial
in
the
pathology
of
asthma

.

Lung
infection
with
respiratory
viruses
is
,
in
general
,
associated
with
cytokine
production
,
inflammation
,
cell
death
,
and
other
pathological
processes
,
which
could
be
triggered
by
enhanced
ROS
production
.

Investigation
of
the
influence
of
these
infections
on
ROS-producing
and
ROS-scavenging
enzymes
and
systems
may
allow
for
the
identification
of
those
that
are
crucial
for
replication
of
the
pathogens
and
occurrence

Our
review
aims
to
summarize
the
known
data
on
the
role
of
redox

Background
:
The
digitization
of
health-related
information
through
electronic
health
records
(
EHR
)
and
electronic
healthcare
reimbursement
claims
and
the
continued
growth
of
self-reported
health
information
through
social
media
provides
both
tremendous
opportunities
and
challenges
in
developing
effective
biosurveillance
tools
.

With
novel
emerging
infectious
diseases
being
reported
across
different
parts
of
the
world
,
there
is
a
need
to
build
systems
that
can
track
,
monitor
and
report
such
events
in
a
timely
manner
.

Further
,
it
is
also
important
to
identify
susceptible
geographic
regions
and
populations
where
emerging
diseases
may
have
a
significant
impact
.

Methods
:
In
this
paper
,
we
present
an
overview
of
Oak
Ridge
Biosurveillance
Toolkit
(
ORBiT
)
,
which
we
have
developed
specifically
to
address
data
analytic
challenges
in
the
realm
of
public
health
surveillance
.

In
particular
,
ORBiT
provides
an
extensible
environment
to
pull
together
diverse
,
large-scale
datasets
and
analyze
them
to
identify
spatial
and
temporal
patterns
for
various
biosurveillance-related
tasks
.

Results
:
We
demonstrate
the
utility
of
ORBiT
in
automatically
extracting
a
small
number
of
spatial
and
temporal
patterns
during
the
2009-2010
pandemic
H1N1
flu
season
using
claims
data
.

These
patterns
provide
quantitative
insights
into
the
dynamics
of
how
the
pandemic
flu
spread
across
different
parts
of
the
country
.

We
discovered
that
the
claims
data
exhibits
multi-scale
patterns
from
which
we
could
identify
a
small
number
of
states
in
the
United
States
(
US
)
that
act
as
``
bridge
regions
''
contributing
to
one
or
more
specific
influenza
spread
patterns
.

Similar
to
previous
studies
,
the
patterns
show
that
the
south-eastern
regions
of
the
US
were
widely
affected
by
the
H1N1
flu
pandemic
.

Several
of
these
south-eastern
states
act
as
bridge
regions
,
which
connect
the
north-east
and
central
US
in
terms
of
flu
occurrences
.

Conclusions
:
These
quantitative
insights
show
how
the
claims
data
combined
with
novel
analytical
techniques
can
provide
important
information
to
decision
makers
when
an
epidemic
spreads
throughout
the
country
.

Taken
together
ORBiT
provides
a
scalable
and
extensible
platform
for
public
health
surveillance
.

Porcine
reproductive
and
respiratory
syndrome
(
PRRS
)
virus
(
PRRSV
)
infections
are
characterized
by
prolonged
viremia
and
viral
shedding
consistent
with
incomplete
immunity
.

Type
I
interferons
(
IFN
)
are
essential
for
mounting
efficient
antiviral
innate
and
adaptive
immune
responses
,
but
in
a
recent
study
,
North
American
PRRSV
genotype
2
isolates
did
not
induce
,
or
even
strongly
inhibited
,
IFN-α
in
plasmacytoid
dendritic
cells
(
pDC
)
,
representing
``
professional
IFN-α-producing
cells
''
.

Since
inhibition
of
IFN-α
expression
might
initiate
PRRSV
pathogenesis
,
we
further
characterized
PRRSV
effects
and
host
modifying
factors
on
IFN-α
responses
of
pDC
.

Surprisingly
,
a
variety
of
type
1
and
type
2
PRRSV
directly
stimulated
IFN-α
secretion
by
pDC
.

The
effect
did
not
require
live
virus
and
was
mediated
through
the
TLR7
pathway
.

Furthermore
,
both
IFN-γ
and
IL-4
significantly
enhanced
the
pDC
production
of
IFN-α
in
response
to
PRRSV
exposure
.

PRRSV
inhibition
of
IFN-α
responses
from
enriched
pDC
stimulated
by
CpG
oligodeoxynucleotides
was
weak
or
absent
.

VR-2332
,
the
prototype
genotype
2
PRRSV
,
only
suppressed
the
responses
by
34
%
,
and
the
highest
level
of
suppression
(
51
%
)
was
induced
by
a
Chinese
highly
pathogenic
PRRSV
isolate
.

Taken
together
,
these
findings
demonstrate
that
pDC
respond
to
PRRSV
and
suggest
that
suppressive
activities
on
pDC
,
if
any
,
are
moderate
and
strain-dependent
.

Thus
,
pDC
may
be
a
source
of
systemic
IFN-α
responses
reported
in
PRRSV-infected
animals
,
further
contributing
to
the
puzzling
immunopathogenesis
of
PRRS
.

Cytosolic
sensing
of
pathogens
is
essential
to
a
productive
immune
response
.

Recent
reports
have
emphasized
the
importance
of
signaling
platforms
emanating
from
organelles
and
cytosolic
sensors
,
particularly
during
the
response
to
intracellular
pathogens
.

Here
,
we
highlight
recent
discoveries
identifying
the
key
mediators
of
nucleic
acid
and
cyclic
nucleotide
sensing
and
discuss
their
importance
in
host
defense
.

This
review
will
also
cover
strategies
evolved
by
pathogens
to
manipulate
these
pathways
.

Background
:
Baseline
data
is
necessary
for
monitoring
how
a
population
perceives
the
threat
of
pandemic
influenza
,
and
perceives
how
it
would
behave
in
the
event
of
pandemic
influenza
.

Our
aim
was
to
develop
a
module
of
questions
for
use
in
telephone
health
surveys
on
perceptions
of
threat
of
pandemic
influenza
,
and
on
preparedness
to
comply
with
specific
public
health
behaviours
in
the
event
of
pandemic
influenza
.

Methods
:
A
module
of
questions
was
developed
and
field
tested
on
192
adults
using
the
New
South
Wales
Department
of
Health
's
in-house
Computer
Assisted
Telephone
Interviewing
(
CATI
)
facility
.

The
questions
were
then
modified
and
re
field
tested
on
202
adults
.

The
module
was
then
incorporated
into
the
New
South
Wales
Population
Health
Survey
in
the
first
quarter
of
2007
.

A
representative
sample
of
2,081
adults
completed
the
module
.

Their
responses
were
weighted
against
the
state
population
.

The
reliability
of
the
questions
was
acceptable
with
kappa
ranging
between
0.25
and
0.51
.

Overall
14.9
%
of
the
state
population
thought
pandemic
influenza
was
very
or
extremely
likely
to
occur
;
45.5
%
were
very
or
extremely
concerned
that
they
or
their
family
would
be
affected
by
pandemic
influenza
if
it
occurred
;
and
23.8
%
had
made
some
level
of
change
to
the
way
they
live
their
life
because
of
the
possibility
of
pandemic
influenza
.

In
the
event
of
pandemic
influenza
,
the
majority
of
the
population
were
willing
to
:
be
vaccinated
(
75.4
%
)
,
be
isolated
(
70.2
%
)
,
and
wear
a
face
mask
(
59.9
%
)
.

People
with
higher
levels
of
threat
perception
are
significantly
more
likely
to
be
willing
to
comply
with
specific
public
health
behaviours
.

Conclusion
:
While
only
14.9
%
of
the
state
population
thought
pandemic
influenza
was
very
or
extremely
likely
to
occur
,
a
significantly
higher
proportion
were
concerned
for
self
and
family
should
a
pandemic
actually
occur
.

The
baseline
data
collected
in
this
survey
will
be
useful
for
monitoring
changes
over
time
in
the
population
's
perceptions
of
threat
,
and
preparedness
to
comply
with
specific
public
health
behaviours
.

,
which
is
difficult
to
control
with
general
immunosuppressive
therapy
including
corticosteroids
due
to
the
unfavorable
effect
on
viral
replication
.

Studies
have
suggested
that
the
excessive
activation
of
the
innate
immunity
by
IFV
is
responsible
for
severe
pathologies
.

In
this
study
,
we
focused
on
CARD9
,
a
signaling
adaptor
known
to
regulate
innate
immune
activation
through
multiple
innate
sensor
proteins
,
and
investigated
its
role
in
anti-IFV
defense
and
lung
pathogenesis
in
a
mouse
model
recapitulating
severe
influenza
pneumonia
with
ARDS
.

We
found
that
influenza
pneumonia
was
dramatically
attenuated
in
Card9-deficient
mice
,
which
showed
improved
mortality
with
reduced
inflammatory
cytokines
and
chemokines
in
the
infected
lungs
.

However
,
viral
clearance
,
type-I
interferon
production
,
and
the
development
of
antiviral
B
and
T
cell
immunity
were
not
compromised
by
CARD9
deficiency
.

Syk
or
CARD9-deficient
DCs
but
not
macrophages
showed
impaired
cytokine
but
not
type-I
interferon
production
in
response
to
IFV
in
vitro
,
indicating
a
possible
role
for
the
Syk-CARD9
pathway
in
DCs
in
excessive
inflammation
of
IFV-infected
lungs
.

Therefore
,
inhibition
of
this
pathway
is
an
ideal
therapeutic
target
for
severe
influenza
pneumonia
without
affecting
viral
clearance
.

Background
:
DC-SIGNR
(
also
called
CD209L
)
has
been
extensively
studied
on
its
role
in
host
genetic
predisposition
to
viral
infection
.

In
particular
,
variable
number
tandem
repeat
(
VNTR
)
of
the
neck-region
of
DC-SIGNR
is
highly
polymorphic
and
the
polymorphism
has
been
investigated
for
genetic
predisposition
to
various
infectious
diseases
,
though
conflicting
results
had
been
reported
.

As
infection
is
a
major
cause
of
human
death
and
a
mechanism
of
natural
selection
,
we
hypothesized
that
VNTR
polymorphism
of
DC-SIGNR
might
have
an
effect
on
human
life
span
.

Here
we
collected
361
peri-centenarian
individuals
(
age
≥94
for
female
and
age
≥90
for
male
)
and
342
geographically
matched
controls
(
age
22-53
,
mean
35.0
±
12.0
)
from
Han
Chinese
.

The
VNTR
polymorphism
of
the
neck
region
was
determined
by
PCR
and
genotype
was
called
by
separating
the
PCR
products
in
agarose
gel
.

Results
:
A
total
of
11
genotypes
and
5
alleles
were
found
in
our
population
.

The
genotype
distribution
,
allele
frequencies
and
homozygote
proportion
did
not
show
a
significant
difference
between
peri-centenarian
and
control

down-regulated
proteins
were
organized
into
two
predominant
subnetworks
that
exhibited
distinct
biological
processes
.

The
down-regulated
network
modules
are
involved
in
typical
mitochondrial
functions
,
while
up-regulated
proteins
are
responsible
for
mtDNA
repair
and
regulation
of
mt
protein
expression
and
transport
.

Furthermore
,
comparisons
of
proteome
and
transcriptome
data
revealed
that
r
0
cells
attempted
to
compensate
for
mtDNA
depletion
by
modulating
the
coordinated
expression/transport
of
mt
proteins
.

Our
results
demonstrate
that
mt
protein
composition
changed
to
remodel
the
functional
organization
of
mitochondrial
protein
networks
in
response
to
dysfunctional
cellular
states
.

Human

Many
serious
emerging

have
recently
arisen
from
bats
,
including
Ebola
,

,
SARS-coronavirus
,
Hendra
,
Nipah
,
and
a
number
of
rabies
and
rabies-related
viruses
,
consistent
with
the
overall
observation
that
wildlife
are
an
important
source
of
emerging
zoonoses
for
the
human
population
.

Mechanisms
underlying
the
recognized
association
between
ecosystem
health
and
human
health
remain
poorly
understood
and
responding
appropriately
to
the
ecological
,
social
and
economic
conditions
that
facilitate
disease
emergence
and
transmission
represents
a
substantial
societal
challenge
.

In
the
context
of
disease
emergence
from
wildlife
,
wildlife
and
habitat
should
be
conserved
,
which
in
turn
will
preserve
vital
ecosystem
structure
and
function
,
which
has
broader
implications
for
human
wellbeing
and
environmental
sustainability
,
while
simultaneously
minimizing
the
spillover
of
pathogens
from
wild
animals
into
human
beings
.

In
this
review
,
we
propose
a
novel
framework
for
the
holistic
and
interdisciplinary
investigation
of
zoonotic
disease
emergence
and
its
drivers
,
using
the
spillover
of
bat
pathogens
as
a
case
study
.

This
study
has
been
developed
to
gain
a
detailed
interdisciplinary
understanding
,
and
it
combines
cutting-edge
perspectives
from
both
natural
and
social
sciences
,
linked
to

The
receptor
(

)
for
porcine
sapelovirus
(
PSV
)
,
which
causes
diarrhea
,
pneumonia
,
polioencephalomyelitis
,
and
reproductive
disorders
in
pigs
,
remains
largely
unknown
.

Given
the
precedent
for
other
picornaviruses
which
use
terminal
sialic
acids
(
SAs
)
as
receptors
,
we
examined
the
role
of
SAs
in
PSV
binding
and
infection
.

Using
a
variety
of
approaches
,
including
treating
cells
with
a
carbohydrate-destroying
chemical
(
NaIO
4
)
,
mono-or
oligosaccharides
(
N-acetylneuraminic
acid
,
galactose
,
and
6=-sialyllactose
)
,
linkage-specific
sialidases
(
neuraminidase

)
,
lectins
(

,
proteases
(
trypsin

glucosylceramide
synthase
inhibitors
(
DL-threo-1-phenyl-2-decanoylamino-3-morpholino-1-propanol
and
phospholipase
C
)
,
we
demonstrated
that
PSV
could
recognize
␣2,3-linked
SA
on
glycolipids
as
a
receptor
.

On
the
other
hand
,
PSVs
had
no
binding
affinity
for
synthetic
histo-blood
group
antigens
(
HBGAs
)
,
suggesting
that
PSVs
could
not
use
HBGAs
as
receptors
.

Depletion
of
cell
surface
glycolipids
followed
by
reconstitution
studies
indicated
that
GD1a
ganglioside
,
but
not
other
gangliosides
,
could
restore
PSV
binding
and
infection
,
further
confirming
␣2,3-linked
SA
on
GD1a
as
a
PSV
receptor
.

Our
results
could
provide
significant
information
on
the
understanding
of
the
life
cycle
of
sapelovirus
and
other
picornaviruses
.

For
the
broader
community
in
the
area
of
pathogens
and
pathogenesis
,
these
findings
and
insights
could
contribute
to
the
development
of
affordable
,
useful
,
and
efficient
drugs
for
anti-sapelovirus
therapy
.

The
porcine
sapelovirus
(
PSV
)
is
known
to
cause
enteritis
,
pneumonia
,
polioencephalomyelitis
,
and
reproductive
disorders
in
pigs
.

However
,
the
receptor
(
s
)
that
the
PSV
utilizes
to
enter
host
cells
remains
largely
unknown
.

Using
a
variety
of
approaches
,
we
showed
that
␣2,3-linked
terminal
sialic
acid
(
SA
)
on
the
cell
surface
GD1a
ganglioside
could
be
used
for
PSV
binding
and
infection
as
a
receptor
.

On
the
other
hand
,
histo-blood
group
antigens
also
present
in
the
cell
surface
carbohydrates
could
not
be
utilized
as
PSV
receptors
for
binding
and
infection
.

These
findings
should
contribute
to
the
understanding
of
the
sapelovirus
life
cycle

Cyclophilins
are
peptidyl-prolyl
cis/trans
isomerases
(
PPIase
)
that
catalyse
the
interconversion
of
the
peptide
bond
at
proline
residues
.

Several
cyclophilins
play
a
pivotal
role
in
the
life
cycle
of
a
number
of
viruses
.

The
existing
cyclophilin
inhibitors
,
all
derived
from
cyclosporine
A
or
sanglifehrin
A
,
have
disadvantages
,
including
their
size
,
potential
for
side
effects
unrelated
to
cyclophilin
inhibition
and
drug-drug
interactions
,
unclear
antiviral
spectrum
and
manufacturing
issues
.

Here
we
use
a
fragment-based
drug
discovery
approach
using
nucleic
magnetic
resonance
,
X-ray
crystallography
and
structure-based
compound
optimization
to
generate
a
new
family
of
non-peptidic
,
small-molecule
cyclophilin
inhibitors
with
potent
in
vitro
PPIase
inhibitory
activity
and
antiviral
activity
against
hepatitis
C
virus
,
human
immunodeficiency
virus
and
coronaviruses
.

This
family
of
compounds
has
the
potential
for
broad-spectrum
,
high-barrier-to-resistance
treatment
of
viral
infections
.

Middle
East
respiratory
syndrome
(
MERS
)
is
a
deadly
viral
respiratory
disease
caused
by
MERS-coronavirus
(
MERS-CoV
)
infection
.

To
date
,
there
is
no
specific
treatment
proven
effective
against
this
viral
disease
.

In
addition
,
no
vaccine
has
been
licensed
to
prevent
MERS-CoV
infection
thus
far
.

Therefore
,
our
current
review
focuses
on
the
most
recent
studies
in
search
of
an
effective
MERS
vaccine
.

Overall
,
vaccine
candidates
against
MERS-CoV
are
mainly
based
upon
the
viral
spike
(
S
)
protein
,
due
to
its
vital
role
in
the
viral
infectivity
,
although
several
studies
focused
on
other
viral
proteins
such
as
the
nucleocapsid
(
N
)
protein
,
envelope
(
E
)
protein
,
and
nonstructural
protein
16
(
NSP16
)
have
also
been
reported
.

In
general
,
the
potential
vaccine
candidates
can
be
classified
into
six
types
:
viral
vector-based
vaccine
,
DNA
vaccine
,
subunit
vaccine
,
nanoparticle-based
vaccine
,
inactivated-whole
virus
vaccine
and
liveattenuated
vaccine
,
which
are
discussed
in
detail
.

Besides
,
the
immune
responses
and
potential
antibody
dependent
enhancement
of
MERS-CoV
infection
are
extensively
reviewed
.

In
addition
,
animal
models
used
to
study
MERS-CoV
and
evaluate
the
vaccine
candidates
are
discussed
intensively

Background
:
The
Kingdom
of
Saudi
Arabia
has
experienced
a
prolonged
outbreak
of
Middle
East
Respiratory
Syndrome
(
MERS
)
coronavirus
since
2012
.

Healthcare
workers
(
HCWs
)
form
a
significant
risk
group
for
infection
.

Objectives
:
The
aim
of
this
survey
was
to
assess
the
knowledge
,
attitudes
,
infection
control
practices
and
educational
needs
of
HCWs
in
the
Kingdom
of
Saudi
Arabia
to
MERS
coronavirus
and
other
emerging
infectious
diseases
.

Methods
:
1500
of
HCWs
from
Saudi
Ministry
of
Health
were
invited
to
fill
a
questionnaire
developed
to
cover
the
survey
objectives
from
9
September
2015
to
8
November
2015
.

The
response
rate
was
about
81
%
.

Descriptive
statistics
was
used
to
summarise
the
responses
.

Results
:
1216
HCWs
were
included
in
this
survey
.

A
total
of
56.5
%
were
nurses
and
22
%
were
physicians
.

The
most
common
sources
of
MERS-coronavirus
(
MERS-CoV
)
information
were
the
Ministry
of
Health
(
MOH
)
memo
(
74.3
%
)
.

Only
(
47.6
%
)
of
the
physicians
,
(
30.4
%
)
of
the
nurses
and
(
29.9
%
)
of
the
other
HCWs
were
aware
that
asymptomatic
MERS-CoV
was
described
.

Around
half
of
respondents
who
having
been
investigated
for
MERS-CoV
reported
that
their
work
performance
decreased
while
they
have
suspicion
of
having
MERS-CoV
and
almost
two
thirds
reported
having
psychological
problems
during
this
period
.

Almost
two
thirds
of
the
HCWs
(
61.2
%
)
reported
anxiety
about
contracting
MERS-CoV
from
patients
.

Conclusions
:
The
knowledge
about
emerging
infectious
diseases
was
poor
and
there
is
need
for
further
education
and
training
programs
particularly
in
the
use
of
personal
protective
equipment
,
isolation
and
infection
control
measures
.

The
self-reported
infection
control
practices
were
sub-optimal
and
seem
to
be
overestimated
.

Sudan
virus
(
SUDV
)
outbreaks
in
Africa
are
highly
lethal
;
however
,
the
development
and
testing
of
novel
antivirals
and
vaccines
for
this
virus
has
been
limited
by
a
lack
of
suitable
animal
models
.

Non-human
primates
(
NHP
)
remain
the
gold
standard
for
modeling
filovirus
disease
,
but
they
are
not
conducive
to
screening
large
numbers
of
experimental
compounds
and
should
only
be
used
to
test
the
most
promising
candidates
.

Therefore
,
other
smaller
animal
models
are
a
valuable
asset
.

We
have
recently
developed
a
guinea-pig
adapted
SUDV
virus
that
is
lethal
in
guinea
pigs
.

In
our
current
study
,
we
show
that
ferrets
are
susceptible
to
wild-type
SUDV
,
providing
a
small
animal
model
to
directly
study
clinical
isolates
,
screen
experimental
anti-SUDV
compounds
and
potentially
study
viral
transmission
.

Bats
are
found
to
be
the
natural
reservoirs
for
many
emerging
viruses
.

In
most
cases
,
severe
clinical
signs
caused
by
such
virus
infections
are
normally
not
seen
in
bats
.

This
indicates
differences
in
the
virus-host
interactions
and
underlines
the
necessity
to
develop
natural
host
related
models
to
study
these
phenomena
.

Due
to
the
strict
protection
of
European
bat
species
,
immortalized
cell
lines
are
the
only
alternative
to
investigate
the
innate
anti-virus
immune
mechanisms
.

Here
,
we
report
about
the
establishment
and
functional
characterization
of
Myotis
myotis
derived
cell
lines

(

)
after

.

The
usefulness
of
these
cell
lines
to
study
antiviral
responses
has
been
confirmed
by
analysis
of
their
susceptibility
to
lyssavirus
infection
and
the
mRNA
patterns
of
immune-relevant
genes
after
poly
I
:
C
stimulation
.

Performed
experiments
indicated
varying
susceptibility
to
lyssavirus
infection
with
MmBr
being
considerably
less
susceptible
than
the
other
cell
lines
.

Further
investigation
demonstrated
a
strong
activation
of
interferon
mediated
antiviral
response
in
MmBr
contributing
to
its
resistance
.

The
pattern
recognition
receptors
:
RIG-I
and
MDA5
were
highly
upregulated
during
rabies
virus
infection
in
MmBr
,
suggesting
their
involvement
in
promotion
of
antiviral
responses
.

The
presence
of
CD14
and
CD68
in
MmBr
suggested
MmBr
cells
are
microglia-like
cells
which
play
a
key
role
in
host
defense
against
infections
in
the
central
nervous
system
(
CNS
)
.

Thus
the
expression
pattern
of
MmBr
combined
with
the
observed
limitation
of
lyssavirus
replication
underpin
a
protective
mechanism
of
the
CNS
controlling
the
lyssavirus
infection
.

Overall
,
the
established
cell
lines
are
important
tools
to
analyze
antiviral
innate
immunity
in
M.
myotis
against
neurotropic
virus
infections
and
present
a
valuable
tool
for
a
broad
spectrum
of
future
investigations
in
cellular
biology
of

Recombinant
proteins
expressed
in
E.
coli
are
frequently
purified
by
immobilized
metal
affinity
chromatography
(
IMAC
)
.

By
means
of
this
technique
,
tagged
proteins
containing
a
polyhistidine
sequence
can
be
obtained
up
to
95
%
pure
in
a
single
step
,
but
some
host
proteins
also
bind
with
great
affinity
to
metal
ions
and
contaminate
the
sample
.

A
way
to
overcome
this
problem
is
to
include
a
second
tag
that
is
recognized
by
a
preexistent
monoclonal
antibody
(
mAb
)
in
the
gene
encoding
the
target
protein
,
allowing
further
purification
.

With
this
strategy
,
the
recombinant
protein
can
be
directly
used
as
target
in
capture
ELISA
using
plates
sensitized
with
the
corresponding
mAb
.

As
a
proof
of
concept
,
in
this
study
we
engineered
a
Trichinella-derived
tag
(
MTFSVPIS
,
recognized
by
mAb
US9
)
into
a
His-tagged
recombinant
Fasciola
antigen
(
rFhLAP
)
to
make
a
new
chimeric
recombinant
protein
(
rUS9-FhLAP
)
,
and
tested
its
specificity
in
capture
and
indirect
ELISAs
with
sera
from
sheep
and
cattle
.

FhLAP
was
selected
since
it
was
previously
reported
to
be
immunogenic
in
ruminants
and
is
expressed
in
soluble
form
in
E.
coli
,
which
anticipates
a
higher
contamination
by
host
proteins
than
proteins
expressed
in
inclusion
bodies
.

Our
results
showed
that
a
large
number
of
sera
from
non-infected
ruminants
(
mainly
cattle
)
reacted
in
indirect
ELISA
with
rUS9-FhLAP
after
single-step
purification
by
IMAC
,
but
that
this
reactivity
disappeared
testing
the
same
antigen
in
capture
ELISA
with
mAb
US9
.

These
results
demonstrate
that
the
6XHis
and
US9
tags
can
be
combined
when
double
purification
of
recombinant
proteins
is
required

more

several

just
the

[

[

Although
this
phenomenon
has
not
yet
been
investigated
in
detail
,
some
reports
pointed
out
that
the
presence
of
contaminants
derived
from
the
expression
of
His-tagged

are
methods
commonly
used
to
prevent
the
co-purification
of

on
immobilized
metal
affinity
chromatography
(
IMAC
)
,
thus
improving
the
purity
of
His-tagged

.

Also
,
disulfide
bond
formation
between
the
protein
of
interest
and
other
proteins
,
as
well
as
nonspecific
hydrophobic
interactions
,
can
be
minimized
by
inclusion
of
2-mercaptoethanol
and
non-ionic
detergents
,
respectively
,
in
the
loading
buffer
[

.

However
,
since
a
relevant
fraction
of
contaminant
E.
coli
proteins
exhibit
moderate
to
strong
affinity
for
metal-chelating
resins
[
9
]
,
these
methods
do
not
guarantee
complete
purity
of
recombinant
proteins
and
may
decrease
the
yield
of
the
purified
protein
.

Another
way
to
overcome
the
above
problems
is
grafting
a
second
linear
epitope
tag
recognized
by
a
monoclonal
antibody
(
mAb
)
into
the
target
sequence
of
interest
,
thus
allowing
repurification
of
the
protein
by
affinity
chromatography
.

Currently
there
are
some
proprietary
tag-mAb
pairs
that
can
be
used
for
affinity-purification
and
for
detection
of
tagged

However
,
to
the
best
of

none

them

RNA
viruses
are
a
genetically
diverse
group
of
pathogens
that
are
responsible
for
some
of
the
most
prevalent
and
lethal
human
diseases
.

Numerous
viruses
introduce
DNA
damage
and
genetic
instability
in
host
cells
during
their
lifecycles
and
some
species
also
manipulate
components
of
the
DNA
damage
response
(
DDR
)
,
a
complex
and
sophisticated
series
of
cellular
pathways
that
have
evolved
to
detect
and
repair
DNA
lesions
.

Activation
and
manipulation
of
the
DDR
by
DNA
viruses
has
been
extensively
studied
.

It
is
apparent
,
however
,
that
many
RNA
viruses
can
also
induce
significant
DNA
damage
,
even
in
cases
where
viral
replication
takes
place
exclusively
in
the
cytoplasm
.

DNA
damage
can
contribute
to
the
pathogenesis
of
RNA
viruses
through
the
triggering
of
apoptosis
,
stimulation
of
inflammatory
immune
responses
and
the
introduction
of
deleterious
mutations
that
can
increase
the
risk
of
tumorigenesis
.

In
addition
,
activation
of
DDR
pathways
can
contribute
positively
to
replication
of
viral
RNA
genomes
.

Elucidation
of
the
interactions
between
RNA
viruses
and
the
DDR
has
provided
important
insights
into
modulation
of
host
cell
functions
by
these
pathogens
.

This
review
summarises
the
current
literature
regarding
activation
and
manipulation
of
the
DDR
by
several
medically
important
RNA
viruses

.

This
research
suggests
that
maternal
mindset
during
pregnancy
has
a
role
in
mode
of
delivery
.

However
,
more
research
is
needed
to
elucidate
potential
causal
pathways
and

.

Influenza
virus
is
one
of
the
most
prevalent
and
ancient
infections
in
humans
.

About
a
fifth
of
world
's
population
is
infected
by
influenza
virus
annually
,
leading
to
high
morbidity
and
mortality
,
particularly
in
infants
,
the
elderly
and
the
immunocompromised
.

In
the
US
alone
,
influenza
outbreaks
lead
to
roughly
30,000
deaths
each
year
.

Current
vaccines
and
anti-influenza
drugs
are
of
limited
use
due
to
high
mutation
rate
of
the
virus
and
side
effects
.

In
recent
years
,
RNA
interference
,
triggered
by
synthetic
short
interfering
RNA
(
siRNA
)
,
has
rapidly
evolved
as
a
potent
antiviral
regimen
.

Properly
designed
siRNAs
have
been
shown
to
function
as
potent
inhibitors
of
influenza
virus
replication
.

The
siRNAs
outperform
traditional
small
molecule
antivirals
in
a
number
of
areas
,
such
as
ease
of
design
,
modest
cost
,
and
fast
turnaround
.

Although
specificity
and
tissue
delivery
remain
major
bottlenecks
in
the
clinical
applications
of
RNAi
in
general
,
intranasal
application
of
siRNA
against
respiratory
viruses
including
,
but
not
limited
to
influenza
virus
,
has
experienced
significant
success
and
optimism
,
which
is
reviewed
here
.

Hantaan
virus
(
HTNV
)
and
Puumala
virus
(
PUUV
)
are
rodent-borne
hantaviruses
that
are
the
primary
causes
of
hemorrhagic
fever
with
renal
syndrome
(
HFRS
)
in
Europe
and
Asia
.

The
development
of
well
characterized
animal
models
of
HTNV
and
PUUV
infection
is
critical
for
the
evaluation
and
the
potential
licensure
of
HFRS
vaccines
and
therapeutics
.

In
this
study
we
present
three
animal
models
of
HTNV
infection
(
hamster
,
ferret
and
marmoset
)
,
and
two
animal
models
of
PUUV
infection
(
hamster
,
ferret
)
.

Infection
of

of
HTNV
by
the
intramuscular
and~1
ID

of
HTNV
by
the
intranasal
route
leads
to
a
persistent

infection
,
characterized
by
sporadic
viremia
and
high
levels
of
viral
genome
in
the
lung
,
brain
and
kidney
.

In
contrast
,
infection
of
hamsters
with~2

of
PUUV
by
the
intramuscular
or~1
ID
99
of
PUUV
by
the
intranasal
route
leads
to
seroconversion
with
no
detectable
viremia
,
and
a
transient
detection
of
viral
genome
.

Infection
of
ferrets
with
a
high
dose
of
either
HTNV
or
PUUV
by
the
intramuscular
route
leads
to
seroconversion
and
gradual
weight
loss
,
though
kidney
function
remained
unimpaired
and
serum
viremia
and
viral
dissemination
to
organs
was
not
detected
.

In
marmosets
a
1,000
PFU
HTNV
intramuscular
challenge
led
to
robust
seroconversion
and
neutralizing
antibody
production
.

Similarly
to
the
ferret
model
of
HTNV
infection
,
no
renal
impairment
,
serum
viremia
or
viral
dissemination
to
organs
was
detected
in
marmosets
.

This
is
the
first
report
of
hantavirus
infection
in
ferrets
and
marmosets
.

MicroRNAs
(
miRNAs
)
are
single-stranded
RNAs
of
17-24
nt
.

These
molecules
regulate
gene
expression
at
the
posttranscriptional
level
and
are
differentially
expressed
in
viral
acute
respiratory
infections
(
ARIs
)
,
which
are
responsible
for
high
morbidity
and
mortality
around
the
world
.

In
recent
years
,
miRNAs
have
been
studied
in
order
to
discover
anti-viral
ARI
drug
targets
as
well
as
biomarkers
for
diagnosis
,

,
and

.

This
review
presents
an
analysis
of
the
regulatory
response
to
viral
ARIs
of
miRNAs
,
including
their
participation
in
the
innate
immune
response
,
their
utility
as
biomarkers
,
and
their
potential

Infections
of
the
respiratory
tract
can
be
caused
by
a
diversity
of
pathogens
,
both
viral
and
bacterial
.

Rapid
microbiological
diagnosis
ensures
appropriate
antimicrobial
therapy
as
well
as
effective

of
isolation
precautions
.

The
ePlex
respiratory
pathogen
panel
(
RP
panel
)
is
a
novel
molecular
biologybased
assay
,
developed
by
GenMark
Diagnostics
,
Inc.
(
Carlsbad
,

)
,
to
be
performed
within
a
single
cartridge
for
the
diagnosis
of
25
respiratory
pathogens
(
viral
and
bacterial
)
.

The
objective
of
this
study
was
to
compare
the
performance
of
the
RP
panel
with
those
of
laboratory-developed
real-time
PCR
assays
,
using
a
variety
of
previously
collected
clinical
respiratory
specimens
.

A
total
of
343
clinical
specimens
as
well
as
29
external
quality
assessment
(
EQA
)
specimens
and
2
different
Middle
East
respiratory
syndrome
coronavirus
isolates
have
been
assessed
in
this
study
.

The
RP
panel
showed
an
agreement
of
97.4
%
with
the
real-time
PCR
assay
regarding
464
pathogens
found
in
the
clinical
specimens
.

All
pathogens
present
in
clinical
samples
and
EQA
samples
with
a
threshold
cycle
(
C
T
)
value
of
Ͻ30
were
detected
correctly
using
the
RP
panel
.

The
RP
panel
detected
17
additional
pathogens
,
7
of
which
could
be
confirmed
by
discrepant
testing
.

In
conclusion
,
this
study
shows
excellent
performance
of
the
RP
panel
in
comparison
to
real-time
PCR
assays
for
the
detection
of
respiratory
pathogens
.

The
ePlex
system
provided
a
large
amount
of
useful
diagnostic
data
within
a
short
time
frame
,
with
minimal
hands-on
time
,
and
can
therefore
potentially
be
used
for
rapid
diagnostic
sample-to-answer
testing
,
in
either
a
laboratory

Background
:
Human
CEACAM1
is
a
cell-cell
adhesion
molecule
with
multiple
functions
including
insulin
clearance
in
the
liver
,
vasculogenesis
in
endothelial
cells
,
lumen
formation
in
the
mammary
gland
,
and
binding
of
certain
human
pathogens
.

Principal
Findings
:
Three
genomic
BAC
clones
containing
the
human
CEACAM1
gene
were
microinjected
into
pronuclei
of
fertilized
FVB
mouse
oocytes
.

The
embryos
were
implanted
in
the
oviducts
of
pseudopregnant
females
and
allowed
to
develop
to
term
.

DNA
from
newborn
mice
was
evaluated
by
PCR
for
the
presence
of
the
human
CEACAM1
gene
.

Feces
of
the
PCR
positive
offspring
screened
for
expression
of
human
CEACAM1
.

Using
this
assay
,
one
out
of
five
PCR
positive
lines
was
positive
for
human
CEACAM1
expression
and
showed
stable
transmission
to
the
F1
generation
with
the
expected
transmission
frequency
(
0.5
)
for
heterozygotes
.

Liver
,
lung
,
intestine
,
kidney
,
mammary
gland
,
and
prostate
were
strongly
positive
for
the
dual
expression
of
both
murine
and
human
CEACAM1
and
mimic
that
seen
in
human
tissue
.

Peripheral
blood
and
bone
marrow
granulocytes
stained
strongly
for
human
CEACAM1
and
bound
Neisseria
Opa
proteins
similar
to
that
in
human
neutrophils
.

Conclusion
:
These
transgenic
animals
may
serve
as
a
model
for
the
binding
of
human
pathogens
to
human

Background
:
Microglia
are
resident
macrophages
of
the
central
nervous
system
(
CNS
)
locally
maintained
through
colony-stimulating
factor
1
receptor
(
CSF1R
)
signaling
.

Microglial
depletion
via
CSF1R
inactivation
improves
cognition
in
mouse
models
of
neuroinflammation
,
but
limits
virologic
control
in
the
CNS
of
mouse
models
of
neurotropic
infections
by
unknown
mechanisms
.

We
hypothesize
that
CSF1R
plays
a
critical
role
in
myeloid
cell
responses
that
restrict
viral
replication
and
locally
restimulate
recruited
antiviral
T
cells
within
the
CNS
.

Methods
:
The
impact
of
CSF1R
signaling
during
West
Nile
virus
infection
was
assessed
in
vivo
using
a
mouse
model
of
neurotropic
infection
.

Pharmacological
inactivation
of
CSF1R
was
achieved
using
PLX5622
prior
to
infection
with
virulent
or
attenuated
strains
of
West
Nile
virus
(
WNV
)
,
an
emerging
neuropathogen
.

The
subsequent
effect
of
CSF1R
antagonism
on
virologic
control
was
assessed
by
measuring
mortality
and
viral
titers
in
the
CNS
and
peripheral
organs
.

Immune
responses
were
assessed
by
flow
cytometric-based
phenotypic
analyses
of
both
peripheral
and
CNS
immune
cells
.

Results
:
Mice
treated
with
CSF1R
antagonist
prior
to
infection
exhibited
higher
susceptibility
to
lethal
WNV
infection
and
lack
of
virologic
control
in
both
the
CNS
and
periphery
.

CSFR1
antagonism
reduced
B7
co-stimulatory
signals
on
peripheral
and
CNS
antigen-presenting
cells
(
APCs
)
by
depleting
CNS
cellular
sources
,
which
limited
local
reactivation
of
CNS-infiltrating
virus-specific
T
cells
and
reduced
viral
clearance
.

Conclusions
:
Our
results
demonstrate
the
impact
of
CSF1R
antagonism
on
APC
activation
in
the
CNS
and
periphery
and
the
importance
of
microglia
in
orchestrating
the
CNS
immune
response
following
neurotropic
viral
infection
.

These
data
will
be
an
important
consideration
when
assessing
the
benefit
of
CSF1R
antagonism
,
which
has
been
investigated
as
a
therapeutic
for
neurodegenerative
conditions
,
in
which
neuroinflammation
is
a
contributing
factor
.

Introduction
:
Viruses
are
major
aetiological
agents
of
acute
respiratory
infection
in
young
children
.

Although
many
studies
have
reported
detection
and
analysis
of
respiratory
viruses
in
sporadic
cases
,
there
have
been
few
follow-up
studies
of
individuals
.

The
purpose
of
this
study
was
to
investigate
the
frequency
of
respiratory
viral
infections
in
a
young
child
and
to
examine
the
duration
of
viral
genome
detection
in
clinical
specimens
.

Case
presentation
:
A
total
of
284
nasal
swabs
were
collected
during
symptomatic
(
196
specimens
)
and
asymptomatic
(
88
specimens
)
periods
of
respiratory
symptoms
from
a
young
female
child
(
from
4
months
to
31
months
of
age
,
who
was
admitted
to
a
nursery
school
at
9
months
)
.

Multiplex
real-time
PCR
for
19
respiratory
viruses
or
subtypes
was
performed
.

One
hundred
and
ninety-eight
of
the
tested
specimens
were
virus
positive
(
69.7
%
)
(
symptomatic
periods
,
149/196
,
76.0
%
;
asymptomatic
periods
,
49/88
,
55.7
%
)
.

Rhinovirus
was
the
most
frequently
detected
(
26
times
)
.

Long
durations
of
detection
were
observed
for
human
coronavirus
NL63
(
30
days
)
,
rhinovirus
(
28
days
)
and
human
bocavirus
1
(
22
days
)
.

Conclusion
:
Young
children
living
in
a
group
context
have
a
high
risk
of
respiratory
virus
infections
,
especially
rhinovirus
.

In
some
instances
,
viral
genomes
were
detectable
for
about
1
month
by
PCR
.

This
study
evaluates
the
effects
of
Sargassum
pallidum
polysaccharides
(
SPP
)
on
the
immune
responses
in
a
chicken
model
.

The
adjuvanticity
of
Sargassum
pallidum
polysaccharides
in
Newcastle
disease
(
ND
)
,
infectious
bronchitis
(
IB
)
and
avian
influenza
(
AI
)
was
investigated
by
examining
the
antibody
titers
and
lymphocyte
proliferation
following
immunization
in
chickens
.

The
chickens
were
administrated
combined
ND
,
IB
and
AI
inactivated
vaccines
containing
SPP
at
10
,
30
and
50
mg/mL
,
using
an
oil
adjuvant
vaccine
as
a
control
.

The
ND
,
IB
and
AI
antibody
titers
and
the
lymphocyte
proliferation
were
enhanced
at
30
mg/mL
SPP
.

In
conclusion
,
an
appropriate
dose
of
SPP
may
be
a
safe
and
efficacious
immune
stimulator
candidate
that
is
suitable
for
vaccines
to
produce
early
and
persistent
prophylaxis
.

An
increasingly
asked
question
is
'can
we
confidently
link
bats
with
emerging
viruses
?

'
.

No
,
or
not
yet
,
is
the
qualified
answer
based
on
the
evidence
available
.

Although
more
than
200
viruses
-some
of
them
deadly
zoonotic
viruses
-have
been
isolated
from
or
otherwise
detected
in
bats
,
the
supposed
connections
between
bats
,
bat
viruses
and
human
diseases
have
been
raised
more
on
speculation
than
on
evidence
supporting
their
direct
or
indirect
roles
in
the
epidemiology
of
diseases
(
except
for
rabies
)
.

However
,
we
are
convinced
that
the
evidence
points
in
that
direction
and
that
at
some
point
it
will
be
proved
that
bats
are
competent
hosts
for
at
least
a
few
zoonotic
viruses
.

In
this
review
,
we
cover
aspects
of
bat
biology
,
ecology
and
evolution
that
might
be
relevant
in
medical
investigations
and
we
provide
a
historical
synthesis
of
some
disease
outbreaks
causally
linked
to
bats
.

We
provide
evolutionary-based
hypotheses
to
tentatively
explain
the
viral
transmission
route
through
mammalian
intermediate
hosts
and
to
explain
the
geographic
concentration
of
most
outbreaks
,
but
both
are
no
more
than
speculations
that
still
require
formal
assessment
.

Alterations
in
global
mRNA
decay
broadly
impact
multiple
stages
of
gene
expression
,
although
signals
that
connect
these
processes
are
incompletely
defined
.

Here
,
we
used
tandem
mass
tag
labeling
coupled
with
mass
spectrometry
to
reveal
that
changing
the
mRNA
decay
landscape
,
as
frequently
occurs
during
viral
infection
,
results
in
subcellular
redistribution
of
RNA
binding
proteins
(
RBPs
)
in
human
cells
.

Accelerating
Xrn1-dependent
mRNA
decay
through
expression
of
a
gammaherpesviral
endonuclease
drove
nuclear
translocation
of
many
RBPs
,
including
poly
(
A
)
tail-associated
proteins
.

Conversely
,
cells
lacking
Xrn1
exhibited
changes
in
the
localization
or
abundance
of
numerous
factors
linked
to
mRNA
turnover
.

Using
these
data
,
we
uncovered
a
new
role
for
relocalized
cytoplasmic
poly
(
A
)
binding
protein
in
repressing
recruitment
of
TATA
binding
protein
and
RNA
polymerase
II
to
promoters
.

Collectively
,
our
results
show
that
changes
in
cytoplasmic
mRNA
decay
can
directly
impact
protein
localization
,
providing
a
mechanism
to
connect
seemingly
distal
stages
of
gene
expression
.

Since
its
invention
in
1985
the
polymerase
chain
reaction
(
PCR
)
has
become
a
well-established
method
for
amplification
and
detection
of
segments
of
double-stranded
DNA
.

Incorporation
of
fluorogenic
probe
or
DNA
intercalating
dyes
(
such
as
SYBR
Green
)
into
the
PCR
mixture
allowed
real-time
reaction
monitoring
and
extraction
of
quantitative
information
(
qPCR
)
.

Probes
with
different
excitation
spectra
enable
multiplex
qPCR
of
several
DNA
segments
using
multi-channel
optical
detection
systems
.

Here
we
show
multiplex
qPCR
using
an
economical
EvaGreen-based
system
with
single
optical
channel
detection
.

Previously
reported
non
quantitative
multiplex
realtime
PCR
techniques
based
on
intercalating
dyes
were
conducted
once
the
PCR
is
completed
by
performing
melting
curve
analysis
(
MCA
)
.

The
technique
presented
in
this
paper
is
both
qualitative
and
quantitative
as
it
provides
information
about
the
presence
of
multiple
DNA
strands
as
well
as
the
number
of
starting
copies
in
the
tested
sample
.

Besides
important
internal
control
,
multiplex
qPCR
also
allows
detecting
concentrations
of
more
than
one
DNA
strand
within
the
same
sample
.

Detection
of
the
avian
influenza
virus
H7N9
by
PCR
is
a
well
established
method
.

Multiplex
qPCR
greatly
enhances
its
specificity
as
it
is
capable
of
distinguishing
both
haemagglutinin
(
HA
)
and
neuraminidase
(
NA
)
genes
as
well
as
their
ratio
.

The
influenza
A
virus
is
composed
of
eight
RNA
segments
of
negative-sense
single-stranded
RNA
where
segment
4
encodes
the
haemagglutinin
(
HA
)
gene
,
and
segment
6
the
neuraminidase
(
NA
)
gene
.

In
order
to
increase
specificity
of
H7N9
detection
,
besides
the
detection
of
the
virus
itself
,
one
should
also
detect
both
HA
and
NA
individually
as
well
as
their
ratio
.

PCR
is
the
method
of
choice
to
detect
the
virus
as
it
can
deliver
results
in
tens
of
minutes
compared
to
traditional
methods
such
as
ELISA
where
the
testing
takes
a
few
days
.

The
polymerase
chain
reaction
(
PCR
)
was
invented
in
1985
1,2
to
amplify
double
stranded
DNA
segments
.

Adding
fluorogenic
probe
or
DNA
intercalating
dyes
(
such
as
SYBR
Green
)
allowed
real-time
3
reaction
progress
monitoring
and
extracting
of
quantitative
information
(
qPCR
)
4,5
.

A
typical
PCR
process
consists
of
three
steps
conducted
at
different
temperatures
:
denaturation
at
95
°C
,
annealing
at
50-60
°C
and
extension
at
72
°C
.

Using
the
Taqman
probe-based
PCR
system
the
annealing
and
extension
steps
are
combined
into
one
and
performed
at
a
temperature
of
about
60
°C
5
.

The
presence
of
end-point
PCR
products
can
be
confirmed
by
agarose
gel
electrophoresis
or
by
capillary
electrophoresis
(
CE
)
6
.

However
,
an
end-point
measurement
does
not
necessarily
correlate
with
the
original
number
of
copies
of
the
amplified
DNA
sequence
.

Real-time
PCR
allows
precise
quantitative
information
to
be
extracted
from
the
exponential
phase
of
the
reaction
4,7
.

The
Taqman
probe-based
assay

for
example
the
FAM

)
and

is

The
Bible
describes
the
case
of
a
woman
with
high
fever
cured
by
our
Lord
Jesus
Christ
.

Based
on
the
information
provided
by
the
gospels
of
Mark
,
Matthew
and
Luke
,
the
diagnosis
and
the
possible
etiology
of
the
febrile
illness
is
discussed
.

Infectious
diseases
continue
to
be
a
threat
to
humanity
,
and
influenza
has
been
with
us
since
the
dawn
of
human
history
.

If
the
postulation
is
indeed
correct
,
the
woman
with
fever
in
the
Bible
is
among
one
of
the
very
early
description
of
human
influenza
disease

We
analysed

Gene
transcription
profiles
across
tissues
are
largely
defined
by
the
activity
of
regulatory
elements
,
most
of
which
correspond
to
regions
of
accessible
chromatin
.

Regulatory
element
activity
is
in
turn
modulated
by
genetic
variation
,
resulting
in
variable
transcription
rates
across
individuals
.

The
interplay
of
these
factors
,
however
,
is
poorly
understood
.

Here
we
characterize
expression
and
chromatin
state
dynamics
across
three
tissues-liver
,
lung
,
and
kidney-in
47
strains
of
the
Collaborative
Cross
(
CC
)
mouse
population
,
examining
the
regulation
of
these
dynamics
by
expression
quantitative
trait
loci
(
eQTL
)
and
chromatin
QTL
(
cQTL
)
.

QTL
whose
allelic
effects
were
consistent
across
tissues
were
detected
for
1,101
genes
and
133
chromatin
regions
.

Also
detected
were
eQTL
and
cQTL
whose
allelic
effects
differed
across
tissues
,
including
local-eQTL
for
Pik3c2g
detected
in
all
three
tissues
but
with
distinct
allelic
effects
.

Leveraging
overlapping
measurements
of
gene
expression
and
chromatin
accessibility
on
the
same
mice
from
multiple
tissues
,
we
used
mediation
analysis
to
identify
chromatin
and
gene
expression
intermediates
of
eQTL
effects
.

Based
on
QTL
and
mediation
analyses
over
multiple
tissues
,
we
propose
a
causal
model
for
the
distal
genetic
regulation
of
Akr1e1
,
a
gene
involved
in
glycogen
metabolism
,
through
the
zinc
finger
transcription
factor
Zfp985
and
chromatin
intermediates
.

This
analysis
demonstrates
the
complexity
of
transcriptional
and
chromatin
dynamics
and
their
regulation
over
multiple
tissues
,
as
well
as
the
value
of
the
CC
and
related
genetic
resource
populations
for
identifying
specific
regulatory
mechanisms
within
cells

Background
:
Toxocariasis
is
a
highly
prevalent
parasitic
disease
in
the
tropical
regions
of
the
world
,
with
its
impact
on
public
health
being
typically
underestimated
.

To
better
recognise
the
trends
and
characteristics
of
toxocariasis
research
,
this
study
is
a
bibliometric
analysis
of
the
global
toxocariasis
research
.

Methods
:
Searches
were
completed
on
April
5
,
2016
,
using
the
Scopus
database
.

A
search
without
any
language
restriction
was
performed
to
extract
publications
dealing
with
toxocariasis
.

Terms
related
to
toxocariasis
were
used
to
perform
a
title
keyword
search
.

Results
:
A
total
of
2765
publications
comprising
11
document
types
and
published
between
1932
and
2015
were
included
in
the
analysis
.

Articles
were
the
most
popular
document
form
,
accounting
for
83.62
%
of
all
publications
,
followed
by
letters
(
3.80
%
)
and
reviews
(
3.4
%
)
.

The
annual
number
of
research
publications
increased
from
30
in
1980
to
111
in
2015
,
indicating
that
the
number
of
publications
on
toxocariasis
has
increased
slowly
over
the
past
35
years
.

The
United
States
of
America
and
Japan
are
the
predominant
countries
of
origin
,
with
303
articles
and
207
articles
,
respectively
,
followed
by
Brazil
and
the
United
Kingdom
,
with
180
(
6.5
%
)
each
.

The
h-index
for
all
the
publications
was
60
.

The
highest
h-index
were
for
publications
from
the
United
Kingdom
(
h-index
value
=
43
)
and
the
United
States
(
h-index
value
=
39
)
;
these
two
countries
were
also
involved
with
the
highest
number
of
international
collaborations
,
with
27
and
28
countries
,
respectively
.

Conclusions
:
Developed
countries
,
including
the
United
States
,
Japan
,
the
United
Kingdom
,
France
,
Germany
and
Italy
,
are
the
world
's
leaders
in
toxocariasis
research
,
contributing
to
more
than
34
%
of
the
total
published
literature
.

In
addition
,
developing
countries
,
such
as
Brazil
,
Poland
,
Argentina
and
India
,
showed
a
noticeable
increase
in
published
papers
on
toxocariasis
research
in
recent
years
.

A
push
for
more
collaboration
is
needed
to
achieve
a
superior
research
strategy
related
to
toxocariasis
at
the
global
level
from
the
viewpoint
of
epidemiological
data
,
clinical
aspects
,
medical
ecology
,
molecular
aspects
and
treatment
practices
associated
with
toxocariasis
.

The
cross-species
transmission
of
viruses
from
one
host
species
to
another
is
responsible
for
the
majority
of
emerging
infections
.

However
,
it
is
unclear
whether
some
virus
families
have
a
greater
propensity
to
jump
host
species
than
others
.

If
related
viruses
have
an
evolutionary
history
of
co-divergence
with
their
hosts
there
should
be
evidence
of
topological
similarities
between
the
virus
and
host
phylogenetic
trees
,
whereas
host
jumping
generates
incongruent
tree
topologies
.

By
analyzing
co-phylogenetic
processes
in
19
virus
families
and
their
eukaryotic
hosts
we
provide
a
quantitative
and
comparative
estimate
of
the
relative
frequency
of
virus-host
co-divergence
versus
cross-species
transmission
among
virus
families
.

Notably
,
our
analysis
reveals
that
cross-species
transmission
is
a
near
universal
feature
of
the
viruses
analyzed
here
,
with
virus-host
co-divergence
occurring
less
frequently
and
always
on
a
subset
of
viruses
.

Despite
the
overall
high
topological
incongruence
among
virus
and
host
phylogenies
,
the
Hepadnaviridae
,
Polyomaviridae
,
Poxviridae
,
Papillomaviridae
and
Adenoviridae
,
all
of
which
possess
double-stranded
DNA
genomes
,
exhibited
more
frequent
co-divergence
than
the
other
virus
families
studied
here
.

At
the
other
extreme
,
the
virus
and
host
trees
for
all
the
RNA
viruses
studied
here
,
particularly
the
Rhabdoviridae
and
the
Picornaviridae
,
displayed
high
levels
of
topological
incongruence
,
indicative
of
frequent
host
switching
.

Overall
,
we
show
that
cross-species
transmission
plays
a
major
role
in
virus
evolution
,
with
all
the
virus
families
studied
here
having
the
potential
to
jump
host
species
,
and
that
increased
sampling
will
likely
reveal
more
instances
of
host
jumping
.

Autopsy
studies
have
shown
that
human
highly
pathogenic
avian
influenza
virus
(
H5N1
)
can
infect
multiple
human
organs
other
than
just
the
lungs
,
and
that
possible
causes
of
organ
damage
are
either
viral
replication
and/or
dysregulation
of
cytokines
and
chemokines
.

Uncertainty
still
exists
,
partly
because
of
the
limited
number
of
cases
analysed
.

In
this
study
,
a
full
autopsy
including
5
organ
systems
was
conducted
on
a
confirmed
H5N1
human
fatal
case
(
male
,
42
years
old
)
within
18
hours
of
death
.

In
addition
to
the
respiratory
system
(
lungs
,
bronchus
and
trachea
)
,
virus
was
isolated
from
cerebral
cortex
,
cerebral
medullary
substance
,
cerebellum
,
brain
stem
,
hippocampus
ileum
,
colon
,
rectum
,
ureter
,
aortopulmonary
vessel
and
lymph-node
.

Real
time
RT-PCR
evidence
showed
that
matrix
and
hemagglutinin
genes
were
positive
in
liver
and
spleen
in
addition
to
positive
tissues
with
virus
isolation
.

Immunohistochemistry
and
in-situ
hybridization
stains
showed
accordant
evidence
of
viral
infection
with
real
time
RT-PCR
except
bronchus
.

Quantitative
RT-PCR
suggested
that
a
high
viral
load
was
associated
with
increased
host
responses
,
though
the
viral
load
was
significantly
different
in
various
organs
.

Cells
of
the
immunologic
system
could
also
be
a
target
for
virus
infection
.

Overall
,
the
pathogenesis
of
HPAI
H5N1
virus
was
associated
both
with
virus
replication
and
with
immunopathologic
lesions
.

In
addition
,
immune
cells
can
not
be
excluded
from
playing
a
role
in
dissemination
of
the
virus
in
vivo

Hand

mouth
disease
(
HFMD
)
,
a
common
contagious
disease
that
usually
affects
children
,
is
normally
mild
but
can
have
life-threatening
manifestations
.

It
can
be
caused
by
enteroviruses
,
particularly
Coxsackieviruses
and
human
enterovirus
71
(
HEV71
)
with
highly
variable
clinical
manifestations
.

In
the
spring
of
2008
,
a
large
,
unprecedented
HFMD
outbreak
in
Fuyang
city
of
Anhui
province
in
the
central
part
of
southeastern
China
resulted
in
a
high
aggregation
of
fatal
cases
.

In
this
study
,
epidemiologic
and
clinical
investigations
,
laboratory
testing
,
and
genetic
analyses
were
performed
to
identify
the
causal
pathogen
of
the
outbreak
.

Of
the
6,049
cases
reported
between
1
March
and
9
May
of
2008
,
3023
(
50
%
)
were
hospitalized
,
353
(
5.8
%
)
were
severe
and
22
(
0.36
%
)
were
fatal
.

HEV71
was
confirmed
as
the
etiological
pathogen
of
the
outbreak
.

Phylogenetic
analyses
of
entire
VP1
capsid
protein
sequence
of
45
Fuyang
HEV71
isolates
showed
that
they
belong
to
C4a
cluster
of
the
C4
subgenotype
.

In
addition
,
genetic
recombinations
were
found
in
the
3D
region
(
RNA-dependent
RNA
polymerase
,
a
major
component
of
the
viral
replication

of
the

)
between
the
Fuyang
HEV71
strain
and
Coxsackievirus
A16
(
CV-A16
)
,
resulting
in
a
recombination
virus
.

In
conclusion
,
an
emerging
recombinant
HEV71
was
responsible
for
the
HFMD
outbreak
in
Fuyang
City
of
China
,
2008
.

Objective
:
This
study
was
conducted
to
identify
the
association
between
rs4804803
polymorphism
in
DC-SIGN
with
the
susceptibility
of
severe
dengue
.

Methods
:
A
comprehensive

was
conducted
to
identify
all

Odds
ratios
(

)
and
corresponding
95

intervals
(

)
were
used
to
assess
the
association
.

Subgroup
analyses
were
performed
by
ethnicity
.

Sensitivity
analyses
were
performed
through
employing
different
statistical
models
(
fixed

)
.

Results
:
A
total
of
nine
papers
and
12
studies
,
with
1520
severe
dengue
and
1496
clinical
dengue
infection
were
included
.

The
overall
meta-analysis
revealed
significant
associations
between
rs4804803
and
severe
dengue
under
the
recession
(

,
but
sensitivity
analysis
indicated
that
the
significant
pooled
ORs
were
not
robust
.

The
subgroup
analysis
suggested
that
the

in
rs4804803
was
a
risk
factor
for
severe

it
was
a

.

The
results
from

Cystic
fibrosis
(
CF
)
is
a
hereditary
disease
that
is
characterized
by
defective
mucociliary
clearance
,
airway
obstruction
,
chronic
infection
,
and
persistent
inflammation
.

Cystic
fibrosis
pulmonary
exacerbation
(
CFPE
)
majorly
causes
the
morbidity
of
CF
patients
.

Although
CF
has
been
demonstrated
to
change
the
composition
of
lung
microbial
community
,
previous
studies
have
not
made
efforts
to
study
the
differences
in
the
mechanism
of
assembly
and
diversity
maintenance
of
lung
microbial
community
in
CF
patients
.

In
this
study
,
we
applied
the
neutral
theory
of
biodiversity
to
comparatively
investigate
the
assembly
and
diversity
maintenance
of
the
lung
microbial
community
before
and
after
the
antibiotic
treatment
by
reanalyzing
the
dataset
from
Fodor
et
al
's
study
.

We
found
that
no
one
sample
in
the
lung
microbial
communities
of
the
sputum
samples
of
Exacerbation
group
,
nor
those
of
End-of-treatment
group
satisfied
the
predictions
of
neutral
model
,
suggesting
that
the
neutral-process
does
not
dominate
in
CF
patients
before
and
after
antibiotic
treatments
.

By
comparing
the
biodiversity
parameter
between
Exacerbation
and
End-of-treatment
group
,
we
found
that
the
former
had
the
significantly
higher
biodiversity
,
but
the
change
in
diversity
parameter
is
slight
and
the
P
value
is
close
to.05
(
P
value
=
.41
)
.

Therefore
,
our
second
finding
is
that
although
CFPE
may
increase
the
biodiversity
of
lung
microbial
community
,
the
change
is
not
essential
.

The
first
known
cases
of
Middle
East
respiratory
syndrome
(
MERS
)
,
associated
with
infection
by
a
novel
coronavirus
(
CoV
)
,
occurred
in
2012
in
Jordan
but
were
reported
retrospectively
.

The
case
first
to
be
publicly
reported
was
from
Jeddah
,
in
the
Kingdom
of
Saudi
Arabia
(
KSA
)
.

Since
then
,
MERS-CoV
sequences
have
been
found
in
a
bat
and
in
many
dromedary
camels
(
DC
)
.

MERS-CoV
is
enzootic
in
DC
across
the
Arabian
Peninsula
and
in
parts
of
Africa
,
causing
mild
upper
respiratory
tract
illness
in
its
camel
reservoir
and
sporadic
,
but
relatively
rare
human
infections
.

Precisely
how
virus
transmits
to
humans
remains
unknown
but
close
and
lengthy
exposure
appears
to
be
a
requirement
.

The
KSA
is
the
focal
point
of
MERS
,
with
the
majority
of
human
cases
.

In
humans
,
MERS
is
mostly
known
as
a
lower
respiratory
tract
(
LRT
)
disease
involving
fever
,
cough
,
breathing
difficulties
and
pneumonia
that
may
progress
to
acute
respiratory
distress
syndrome
,
multiorgan
failure
and
death
in
20
%
to
40
%
of
those
infected
.

However
,
MERS-CoV
has
also
been
detected
in
mild
and
influenza-like
illnesses
and
in
those
with
no
signs
or
symptoms
.

Older
males
most
obviously
suffer
severe
disease
and
MERS
patients
often
have
comorbidities
.

Compared
to
severe
acute
respiratory
syndrome
(
SARS
)
,
another
sometimes-fatal
zoonotic
coronavirus
disease
that
has
since
disappeared
,
MERS
progresses
more
rapidly
to
respiratory
failure
and
acute
kidney
injury
(
it
also
has
an
affinity
for
growth
in
kidney
cells
under
laboratory
conditions
)
,
is
more
frequently
reported
in
patients
with
underlying
disease
and
is
more
often
fatal
.

Most
human
cases
of
MERS
have
been
linked
to
lapses
in
infection
prevention
and
control
(
IPC
)
in
healthcare
settings
,
with
approximately
20
%
of
all
virus
detections
reported
among
healthcare
workers
(
HCWs
)
and
higher
exposures
in
those
with
occupations
that
bring
them
into
close
contact
with
camels
.

Sero-surveys
have
found
widespread
evidence
of
past
infection
in
adult
camels
and
limited
past
exposure
among
humans
.

Sensitive
,
validated
reverse
transcriptase
real-time
polymerase
chain
reaction
(
RT-rtPCR
)
-based
diagnostics
have
been
available
almost
from
the
start
of
the
emergence
of
MERS
.

While
the
basic
virology
of
MERS-CoV
has
advanced
over
the
past
three
years
,
understanding
of
the
interplay
between
camel
,
environment
,
and
human
remains
limited
.

Background
:
Public
health
systems
in
Canada
have
undergone
significant
policy
renewal
over
the
last
decade
in
response
to
threats
to
the
public
's
health
,
such
as
severe
acute
respiratory
syndrome
.

There
is
limited
research
on
how
public
health
policies
have
been
implemented
or
what
has
influenced
their
implementation
.

This
paper
explores
policy
implementation
in
two
exemplar
public
health
programs
-chronic
disease
prevention
and
sexually-transmitted
infection
prevention
-in
Ontario
,
Canada
.

It
examines
public
health
service
providers
'
,
managers
'
and
senior
managements
'
perspectives
on
the
process
of
implementation
of
the
Ontario
Public
Health
Standards
2008
and
factors
influencing
implementation
.

Methods
:
Public
health
staff
from
six
health
units
representing
rural
,
remote
,
large
and
small
urban
settings
were
included
.

We
conducted
21
focus
groups
and
18
interviews
between
2010
(
manager
and
staff
focus
groups
)
and
2011
(
senior
management
interviews
)
involving
133
participants
.

Research
assistants
coded
transcripts
and
researchers
reviewed
these
;
the
research
team
discussed
and
resolved
discrepancies
.

To
facilitate
a
breadth
of
perspectives
,
several
team
members
helped
interpret
the
findings
.

An
integrated
knowledge
translation
approach
was
used
,
reflected
by
the
inclusion
of
academics
as
well
as
decision-makers
on
the
team
and
as
co-authors
.

Results
:
Front
line
service
providers
often
were
unaware
of
the
new
policies
but
managers
and
senior
management
incorporated
them
in
operational
and
program
planning
.

Some
participants
were
involved
in
policy
development
or
provided
feedback
prior
to
their
launch
.

Implementation
was
influenced
by
many
factors
that
aligned
with
Greenhalgh
and
colleagues
'
empirically-based
Diffusion
of
Innovations
in

Organizations
Framework
.

Factors
and
related
components
that
were
most
clearly
linked
to
the
OPHS
policy
implementation
were
:
attributes
of
the
innovation

settingimplementation
processes
and
routinization
;
and
,
linkage
at
the
design
and
implementation
stage
.

Conclusions
:
Multiple
factors
influenced
public
health
policy
implementation
.

Results
provide
empirical
support
for
components
of
Greenhalgh
et
al
's
framework
and
suggest
two
additional
componentsthe
role
of
external
organizational
collaborations
and
partnerships
as
well
as
planning
processes
in
influencing
implementation
.

These
are
important
to
consider
by
government
and
public
health
organizations
when
promoting
new
or
revised
public
health
policies
as
they
evolve
over
time
.

A
successful
policy
implementation
process
in
Ontario
has
helped
to
move
public
health
towards
the
new
vision
.

where
they
acquire
an
activated
pro-survival
phenotype
with
an
enhanced
respiratory
burst
thought
to
contribute
to
ARDs
pathophysiology
.

model
enables
blood
neutrophil
transepithelial
migration
into
cell-free
tracheal
aspirate
fluid
from
patients
to
recapitulate
the
primary
airway
neutrophil
phenotype
observed
in
vivo
.

Neutrophils
transmigrated
through
our
model
toward
airway
fluid
from
children
with
lower
respiratory
viral
infections
coinfected
with
bacteria
had
elevated
levels
of
neutrophil
activation
markers
but
paradoxically
exhibited
an
inability
to
kill
bacteria
and
a
defective
respiratory
burst
compared
with
children
without
bacterial
coinfection
.

The
airway
fluid
from
children
with
bacterial
coinfections
had
higher
levels
of
neutrophil
elastase
activity
,
as
well
as
myeloperoxidase
levels
compared
to

decreased
respiratory
burst
and
killing
activity
against
H.
influenzae
and
S.
aureus
compared
to
those
transmigrated
into
the
aspirate
fluid
from
children
without
bacterial
coinfection
.

Use
of
a
novel
transmigration
model
recapitulates
this
pathological
phenotype
in
vitro
that
would
otherwise
be
impossible
in
a
patient
,
opening
avenues
for
future
mechanistic
and
therapeutic
research
.

Viral
lower
airway
infections
are
common
in
infants
and
preschool
children
,
and
the
severity
respiratory
symptoms
can
vary
from
mild
cough
and
congestion
to
respiratory
failure
requiring
endotracheal
intubation
and
mechanical
ventilation
.

We
can
not
predict
which
children
will
recover
quickly
versus
those
who
will
progress
to
severe
ARDS
.

No
ARDS-specific
pharmacological
treatments
exist
,
rather
treatment
is
supportive
using
lung-protective
ventilation
strategies
and
the
administration
of
antibiotics
for
suspected
bacterial
infection
.

The
study
of
immune
regulation
in
children
is
needed
because
both
the
lung
and
immunity
are
maturing
during
this
critical
stage
of
development
and
the
primary
cause
of
PARDS
is
direct
lung
injury
due
to
infection
1,2
.

ARDS
is
characterized
by
refractory
hypoxemia
and
non-cardiogenic
pulmonary
edema
due
to
damage
to
the
lung
epithelium
and
pulmonary
endothelium
.

In
adults
with
ARDS
increased
counts
of
airway
neutrophils
are
associated
with
more
severe
lung
injury
and
mortality
3,4
.

Airway
neutrophils
from
adults
with
ARDS
have
enhanced
survival
,
a
primed
respiratory
burst
response
,
and
increased
phagocytic
capacity
5
.

In
patients
with
pulmonary
diseases
characterized
by
chronic
bacterial
infections
,
such
as
cystic
fibrosis
,
airway
neutrophils
inhibit
T-cell
function
via
two
pathways
-by
depletion
of
arginine
following
degranulation
and
activation
of
Arginase-1
(
Arg1
)
,
and
by
activation
of
the
programmed
death
ligand-1
(
PD-L1
)
/programmed
death-1
(
PD-1
)
axis
,
resulting
in
reduced
proliferation
and
impaired
effector
functions
6-15
.

By
contrast
,
pulmonary
environmental
influence
on
immune
cell
regulation
is
poorly
characterized
in
PARDS
due
to
the
lack
of
a
model
system
able
to
recapitulate
the
airway
neutrophil
phenotype
in
severe
paediatric
lung
injury
.

Clinical
information
obtainable
at
the
bedside
is
often
used
to
prognosticate
yet
is
insufficient
for
determining
the
pathobiology
of
the
lung
injury
.

Understanding
the
biology
of
neutrophils
recruited
to
the
lung
during
PARDS
is
crucial
for
advancing
prognostication
,
risk
stratification
,
and
development
of
novel
therapeutic
strategies
for
children
who
progress
to
severe
PARDS
.

Herein
we
hypothesized
that
markers
of
degranulation
on
the
surface
of
airway
neutrophils
and
in
the
cell-free
airway
fluid
within
24-hours
of
intubation
would
be
associated
with
bacterial
respiratory
co-infection
.

We
used
an
in
vitro
model
based
on
blood
neutrophil
transepithelial
migration
into
the
airway
fluid
of
endotracheally
intubated
children
with
suspected
or
confirmed
lower
airway
viral
infections
at
risk
for
progressing
to
or
with
PARDS
16
.

We
hypothesized
that
neutrophils
recruited
to
the
cell-free
airway
fluid
of
children
with
bacterial
coinfections
would
have
a
defective
respiratory
burst
and
ability
to
kill
bacteria
compared
to
children
with
no
bacterial
coinfection
.

Appropriate
adjuvant
selection
may
be
essential
to
optimize
the
potency

to
tailor
the

In

induced

we
observed

2-3-fold
,
whereas

adjuvanted

boosted
the

5-fold
.

Finally
,
we
tested
whether

would
enhanced
the

While

high

The

agent
is
an
additional
hurdle
to
progress
in
this
area
.

Since
the
emergence
of

several
animal
species
have
been
evaluated
as
potential
models

were
found
to
be

but
other
species

mice
are
naturally
non-permissive
to

also

The
Rabbit
Hemorrhagic
Disease
Virus
(
RHDV

induces
a
severe
disease
that
fulfils
many
requirements

However
,
a
better
knowledge
of
molecular
mechanisms
contributing
to
liver
damage
is
required
,
and
it
is
unknown
whether
the
RHDV
induces
liver
autophagy

how
it
relates
to
apoptosis

In
this
study
,
we
attempted
to
explore
which
signalling
pathways
were
involved
in
the
autophagic
response

by
the
RHDV

to
characterize
their
role

RHDV
pathogenesis

were
infected
with

hemmaglutination

The
autophagic
response
was
measured
as
presence
of
autophagic
vesicles
,
LC3
staining
,
conversion
of
LC3-I
to
autophagosome-associated
LC3-II
and
changes
in
expression
of
beclin-1
,
UVRAG
,
Atg5
,
Atg12
,
Atg16L1
and
p62/SQSTM1
.

RHDV-triggered
autophagy
reached
a
maximum
at
24
hours
post-infection
(
hpi
)
and
declined
at
30
and
36
hpi
.

Phosphorylation
of
mTOR
also
augmented
in
early
periods
of
infection
and
there
was
an
increase
in
the
expression
of
the
endoplasmic
reticulum
chaperones
BiP/GRP78
,
CHOP
and
GRP94
.

Apoptosis
,
measured
as
caspase-3
activity
and
expression
of
PARP-1
,
increased
significantly
at
30
and
36
hpi
in
parallel
to
the
maximal
expression
of
the
RHDV
capsid
protein
VP60
.

These
data
indicate
that
RHDV
infection
initiates
a
rapid
autophagic
response
,
perhaps
in
an
attempt
to
protect
liver
,
which
associates
to
ER
stress
development
and
is
independent
from
downregulation
of
the
major
autophagy
suppressor
mTOR
.

As
the
infection
continues
and
the
autophagic
response
declines
,
cells
begin
to
exhibit
apoptosis
.

To
date

in
serious

Therefore
,
the
aim
of
this

is
to
evaluate
the

found
9845
documents
published
in
the
field
of

In
earlier
years
,
researchers
focused
on
terms
related
to
the
topics
of
``
sources
and
biosynthesis
of
aflatoxin
''
,
``
health
effects
by
aflatoxin
''
,
and
``
detoxification
and
treatment
of
aflatoxin
''
.

However
,
in
recent
years
,
researchers
pay
more
attention
to
the
topic
of
detection
and
quantification
of
aflatoxin
.

Conclusions
:
The
quantity
of
research
in
global
aflatoxin
has
substantially
increased
over
the
past
two
decades
.

The
evaluation
of
the
historical
status
and
development
trend
in
aflatoxin
scientific
research
can
guide
future
research
,
and
ultimately
provide
the
basis
for
improving
management
procedures
for
governmental
decisions
,
healthcare
,
industries
,
and
educational
institutions
.

Recent
evidence
suggests
that
a
mutation
in
the
spike
protein
gene
of
feline
coronavirus
(
FCoV
)
,
which
results
in
an
amino
acid
change
from
methionine
to
leucine
at
position
1058
,
may
be
associated
with
feline
infectious
peritonitis
(
FIP
)
.

Tissue
and
faecal
samples
collected
post
mortem
from
cats
diagnosed
with
or
without
FIP
were
subjected
to
RNA
extraction
and
quantitative
reverse-transcriptase
polymerase
chain
reaction
(
qRT-PCR
)
to
detect
FCoV
RNA
.

In
cats
with
FIP
,
95
%
of
tissue
,
and
81
%
of
faecal
samples
were
PCR-positive
,
as
opposed
to
22
%
of
tissue
,
and
60
%
of
faecal
samples
in
cats
without
FIP
.

Relative
FCoV
copy
numbers
were
significantly
higher
in
the
cats
with
FIP
,
both
in
tissues
(
P
<
0.001
)
and
faeces
(
P
=
0.02
)
.

PCR-positive
samples
underwent
pyrosequencing
encompassing
position
1058
of
the
FCoV
spike
protein
.

This
identified
a
methionine
codon
at
position
1058
,
consistent
with
the
shedding
of
an
enteric
form
of
FCoV
,
in
77
%
of
the
faecal
samples
from
cats
with
FIP
,
and
in
100
%
of
the
samples
from
cats
without
FIP
.

In
contrast
,
91
%
of
the
tissue
samples
from
cats
with
FIP
and
89
%
from
cats
without
FIP
had
a
leucine
codon
at
position
1058
,
consistent
with
a
systemic
form
of
FCoV
.

These
results
suggest
that
the
methionine
to
leucine
substitution
at
position
1058
in
the
FCoV
spike
protein
is
indicative
of
systemic
spread
of
FCoV
from
the
intestine
,
rather
than
a
virus
with
the
potential
to
cause
FIP
.

Background
:
Hirudinaria
manillensis
is
an
ephemeral
,
blood-sucking
ectoparasite
,
possessing
anticoagulant
capacities
with
potential
medical
applications
.

Analysis
of
codon
usage
patterns
would
contribute
to
our
understanding
of
the
evolutionary
mechanisms
and
genetic
architecture
of
H.
manillensis
,
which
in
turn
would
provide
insight
into
the
characteristics
of
other
leeches
.

We
analysed
codon
usage
and
related
indices
using
18,000
coding
sequences
(
CDSs
)
retrieved
from
H.
manillensis
RNA-Seq
data
.

Results
:
We
identified
four
highly
preferred
codons
in
H.
manillensis
that
have
G/C-endings
.

Points
generated
in
an
effective
number
of
codons
(
ENC
)
plot
distributed
below
the
standard
curve
and
the
slope
of
a
neutrality
plot
was
less
than
1
.

Highly
expressed
CDSs
had
lower
ENC
content
and
higher
GC
content
than
weakly
expressed
CDSs
.

Principal
component
analysis
conducted
on
relative
synonymous
codon
usage
(
RSCU
)
values
divided
CDSs
according
to
GC
content
and
divided
codons
according
to
ending
bases
.

Moreover
,
by
determining
codon
usage
,
we
found
that
the
majority
of
blood-diet
related
genes
have
undergone
less
adaptive
evolution
in
H.
manillensis
,
except
for
those
with
homologous
sequences
in
the
host
species
.

Conclusions
:
Codon
usage
in
H.
manillensis
had
an
overall
preference
toward
C-endings
and
indicated
that
codon
usage
patterns
are
mediated
by
differential
expression
,
GC
content
,
and
biological
function
.

Although
mutation
pressure
effects
were
also
notable
,
the
majority
of
genetic
evolution
in
H.
manillensis
was
driven
by
natural
selection
.

Correct
identification
of
medicinal
plant
ingredients
is
essential
for
their
safe
use
and
for
the
regulation
of
herbal
drug
supply
chain
.

Loop-mediated
isothermal
amplification
(
LAMP
)
is
a
recently
developed
approach
to
identify
herbal
medicine
species
.

This
novel
molecular
biology
technique
enables
timely
and
accurate
testing
,
especially
in
settings
where
infrastructures
to
support
polymerase
chain
reaction
facilities
are
lacking
.

Studies
that
used
this
method
have
altered
our
view
on
the
extent
and
complexity
of
herbal
medicine
identification
.

In
this
review
,
we
give
an
introduction
into
LAMP
analysis
,
covers
the
basic
principles
and
important
aspects
in
the
development
of
LAMP
analysis
method
.

Then
we
presented
a
critical
review
of
the
application
of
LAMP-based
methods
in
detecting
and
identifying
raw
medicinal
plant
materials
and
their
processed
products
.

We
also
provide
a
practical
standard
operating
procedure
(
SOP
)
for
the
utilization
of
the
LAMP
protocol
in
herbal
authentication
,
and
consider
the
prospects
of
LAMP
technology
in
the
future
developments
of
herbal
medicine
identification
and
the
challenges
associated
with
its
application
.

Human
rhinoviruses
(
HRVs
)
are
responsible
for
more
than
half
of
all
cases
of
the
common
cold
and
cost
billions
of
USD
annually
in
medical
visits
and
missed
school
and

.

An
assessment
was
made
of
the
antiviral
activities
and
mechanisms
of
action
of
paeonol
(
PA
)
and
1,2,3,4,6-penta-O-galloyl-β-D-glucopyranose
(
PGG
)
from
Paeonia
lactiflora
root
toward
HRV-2
and
HRV-4
in
MRC5
cells
using
a
tetrazolium
method
and
real-time
quantitative
reverse
transcription
polymerase
chain
reaction
and
enzyme-linked
immunosorbent
assay
.

Results
were
compared
with
those
of
a
reference
control
ribavirin
.

Based
on
50
%
inhibitory
concentration
values
,
PGG
was
13.4
and
18.0
times
more
active
toward
HRV-2
(
17.89
μM
)
and
HRV-4
(
17.33
μM
)
in
MRC5
cells
,
respectively
,
than
ribavirin
.

The
constituents
had
relatively
high
selective
index
values
(
3.3-
>
8.5
)
.

The
100
μg/mL
PA
and
20
μg/mL
PGG
did
not
interact
with
the
HRV-4
particles
.

These
constituents
inhibited
HRV-4
infection
only
when
they
were
added
during
the
virus
inoculation
(
0
h
)
,
the
adsorption
period
of
HRVs
,
but
not
after
1
h
or
later
.

Moreover
,
the
RNA
replication
levels
of
HRVs
were
remarkably
reduced
in
the
MRC5
cultures
treated
with
these
constituents
.

These
findings
suggest
that
PGG
and
PA
may
block
or
reduce
the
entry
of
the
viruses
into
the
cells
to
protect
the
cells
from
the
virus
destruction
and
abate
virus
replication
,
which
may
play
an
important
role
in
interfering
with
expressions
of
rhinovirus
receptors
(
intercellular
adhesion
molecule-1
and
low-density
lipoprotein
receptor
)
,
inflammatory
cytokines
(
interleukin
(
IL
)
-6
,
IL-8
,
tumor
necrosis
factor
,
interferon
beta
,
and
IL-1β
)
,
and
Toll-like
receptor
,
which
resulted
in
diminishing
symptoms
induced
by
HRV
.

Global
efforts
to
reduce
the
level
of
synthetic
drugs
justify
further
studies
on
P.
lactiflora
root-derived
materials
as
potential
anti-HRV
products
or
lead
molecules
for
the
prevention
or
treatment
of
HRV
.

Background
:
In
an
emerging
influenza
pandemic
,
estimating
severity
(
the
probability
of
a
severe
outcome
,
such
as
hospitalization
,
if
infected
)
is
a
public
health
priority
.

As
many
influenza
infections
are
subclinical
,
sero-surveillance
is
needed
to
allow
reliable
real-time
estimates
of
infection
attack
rate
(
IAR
)
and
severity
.

Methods
and
Findings
:
We
tested
14,766
sera
collected
during
the
first
wave
of
the
2009
pandemic
in
Hong
Kong
using
viral
microneutralization
.

We
estimated
IAR
and
infection-hospitalization
probability
(
IHP
)
from
the
serial
cross-sectional
serologic
data
and
hospitalization
data
.

Had
our
serologic
data
been
available
weekly
in
real
time
,
we
would
have
obtained
reliable
IHP
estimates
1
wk
after
,
1-2
wk
before
,
and
3
wk
after
epidemic
peak
for
individuals
aged
5-14
y
,
15-29
y
,
and
30-59
y
.

The
ratio
of
IAR
to
pre-existing
seroprevalence
,
which
decreased
with
age
,
was
a
major
determinant
for
the
timeliness
of
reliable
estimates
.

If
we
began
sero-surveillance
3
wk
after
community
transmission
was
confirmed
,
with
150
,
350
,
and
500
specimens
per
week
for
individuals
aged
5-14
y
,
15-19
y
,
and
20-29
y
,
respectively
,
we
would
have
obtained
reliable
IHP
estimates
for
these
age
groups
4
wk
before
the
peak
.

For
30-59
y
olds
,
even
800
specimens
per
week
would
not
have
generated
reliable
estimates
until
the
peak
because
the
ratio
of
IAR
to
pre-existing
seroprevalence
for
this
age
group
was
low
.

The
performance
of
serial
cross-sectional
sero-surveillance
substantially
deteriorates
if
test
specificity
is
not
near
100
%
or
pre-existing
seroprevalence
is
not
near
zero
.

These
potential
limitations
could
be
mitigated
by
choosing
a
higher
titer
cutoff
for
seropositivity
.

If
the
epidemic
doubling
time
is
longer
than
6
d
,
then
serial
cross-sectional
serosurveillance
with
300
specimens
per
week
would
yield
reliable
estimates
when
IAR
reaches
around
6
%
-10
%
.

Conclusions
:
Serial
cross-sectional
serologic
data
together
with
clinical
surveillance
data
can
allow
reliable
real-time
estimates
of
IAR
and
severity
in
an
emerging
pandemic
.

Sero-surveillance
for
pandemics
should
be
considered
.

T-cell-mediated
immunotherapy
of
hematological
malignancies
requires
selection
of
targeted
tumor-associated
antigens
and
T-cell
epitopes
contained
in
these
tumor
proteins
.

Epidermal
growth
factor
receptor
pathway
substrate
8
(
EPS8
)
,
whose
function
is
pivotal
for
tumor
proliferation
,
progression
and
metastasis
,
has
been
found
to
be
overexpressed
in
most
human
tumor
types
,
while
its
expression
in
normal
tissue
is
low
.

The
aim
of
the
present
study
was
to
identify
human
leukemia
antigen
(
HLA
)
-A*0201-restricted
epitopes
of
EPS8
by
using
a
reverse
immunology
approach
.

To
achieve
this
,
computer
algorithms
were
used
to
predict
HLA-A*0201
molecular
binding
,
proteasome
cleavage
patterns
as
well
as
translocation
of
transporters
associated
with
antigen
processing
.

Candidate
peptides
were
experimentally
validated
by
T2
binding
affinity
assay
and
brefeldin-A
decay
assay
.

The
functional
avidity
of
peptide-specific
cytotoxic
T
lymphocytes
(
CTLs
)
induced
from
peripheral
blood
mononuclear
cells
of
healthy
volunteers
were
evaluated
by
using
an
enzyme-linked
immunosorbent
spot
assay
and
a
cytotoxicity
assay
.

Four
peptides
,
designated
as
P455
,
P92
,
P276
and
P360
,
had
high
affinity
and
stability
of
binding
towards
the
HLA-A*0201
molecule
,
and
specific
CTLs
induced
by
them
significantly
responded
to
the
corresponding
peptides
and
secreted
IFN-γ
.

At
the
same
time
,
the
CTLs
were
able
to
specifically
lyse
EPS8-expressing
cell
lines
in
an
HLA-A*0201-restricted
manner
.

The
present
study
demonstrated
that
P455
,
P92
,
P276
and
P360
were
CTL
epitopes
of
EPS8
,
and
were
able
to
be
used
for
epitope-defined
adoptive
T-cell
transfer
and
multi-epitope-based
vaccine
design
.

An
outbreak
of
diarrhea
in
pigs
started
in
Guangdong
,
South
China
in
January
2011
.

Cases
were
characterized
by
watery
diarrhea
,
dehydration
and
vomiting
,
with
80-100
%
morbidity
and
50-90
%
mortality
in
suckling
piglets
.

The
causative
agent
of
the
diarrhea
was
ultimately
identified
as
porcine
epidemic
diarrhea
virus
(
PEDV
)
.

In
this
study
,
we
isolated
a
PEDV
strain
designated
CHGD-01
from
piglet
intestines
using
Vero
cell
cultures
,
and
its
specific
cytopathic
effects
were
confirmed
in
susceptible
cells
by
direct
immunofluorescence
testing
and
electron
microscopy
.

The
complete
genome
of
CHGD-01
was
shown
to
be
28,035
nucleotides
in
length
,
with
a
similar
structure
to
that
of
PEDV
reference
strains
.

Phylogenetic
analyses
based
on
the
whole
genome
revealed
that
CHGD-01
shared
nucleotide
sequence
identities
of
98.2-98.4
%
with
two
other
Chinese
isolates
reported
in
the
same
year
,
thus
constituting
a
new
cluster
.

Amino
acid
sequence
analysis
based
on
individual
virus
genes
indicated
a
close
relationship
between
the
spike
protein
gene
of
CHGD-01
and
the
field
strain
KNU0802
in
Korea
.

Its
ORF3
and
nucleoprotein
genes
,
however
,
were
divergent
from
all
other
sequenced
PEDV
isolate
clusters
and
therefore
formed
a
new
group
,
suggesting
a
new
variant
PEDV
isolate
in
China
.

Further
studies
will
be
required
to
determine
the
immunogenicity
and
pathogenicity
of
this
new
variant
.

The
threat
of
a
worldwide
influenza
pandemic
has
greatly
increased
over
the
past
decade
with
the
emergence
of
highly
virulent
avian
influenza
strains
.

The
increased
frequency
of
drug-resistant
influenza
strains
against
currently
available
antiviral
drugs
requires
urgent
development
of
new
strategies
for
antiviral
therapy
,
too
.

The
research
in
the
field
of
therapeutic
peptides
began
to
develop
extensively
in
the
second
half
of
the
20
th
century
.

Since
then
,
the
mechanisms
of
action
for
several
peptides
and
their
antiviral
prospect
received
large
attention
due
to
the
global
threat
posed
by
viruses
.

Here
,
we
discussed
the
therapeutic
properties
of
peptides
used
in
influenza
treatment
.

Peptides
with
antiviral
activity
against
influenza
can
be
divided
into
three
main
groups
.

First
,
entry
blocker
peptides
such
as
a
Flupep
that
interact
with
influenza
hemagglutinin
,
block
its
binding
to
host
cells
and
prevent
viral
fusion
.

Second
,
several
peptides
display
virucidal
activity
,
disrupting
viral
envelopes
,
e.g.
,
Melittin
.

Finally
,
a
third
set
of
peptides
interacts
with
the
viral
polymerase
complex
and
act
as
viral
replication
inhibitors
such
as
PB1
derived
peptides
.

Here
,
we
present
a
review
of
the
current
literature
describing
the
antiviral
activity
,
mechanism
and
future
therapeutic
potential
of
these
influenza
antiviral
peptides
.

Background
:
Cyrtomium
fortumei
(
J
.
)

Smith
is
an
important
Chinese
herbal
medicine
because
of
its
biological
functions
.

However
,
systematic
and
comprehensive
studies
on
the
phytochemicals
from
Cyrtomium
fortumei
(
J
.
)

Smith
and
their
bioactivity
are
limited
.

Results
:
Using
the
bioassay-guided
technique
,
the
ethyl
acetate
and
n-BuOH
extracts
of
the
rhizomes
of
Cyrtomium
fortumei
(
J
.
)

Smith
were
shown
to
exhibit
good
antitumor
activities
,
consequently
leading
to
the
isolation
of
23
compounds
.

All
compounds
were
isolated
from
the
plant
for
the
first
time
.

The
inhibitory
activities
of
these
compounds
were
investigated
on
tumor
cells
MGC-803
,
PC3
,
and
A375
in
vitro
by
MTT
(
thiazolyl
blue
tetrazolium
bromide
)
assay
,
and
the
results
showed
that
pimpinellin
(
3
)
had
potent
cytotoxic
activities
against
the
three
cell
lines
,
with
the
IC
50
values
of
14.4
±
0.3
μM
,
20.4
±
0.5
μM
,
and
29.2
±
0.6
μM
,
respectively
.

The
mechanism
of
the
antitumor
action
indicated
that
pimpinellin
inhibited
the
growth
of
MGC-803
cells
via
the
induction
of
tumor
cell
apoptosis
,
with
apoptosis
ratio
of
27.44
%
after
72
h
of
treatment
at
20
μM
.

Conclusions
:
This
study
suggests
that
most
of
the
compounds
from
the
roots
of
Cyrtomium
fortumei
(
J
.
)

Smith
could
inhibit
the
growth
of
human
carcinoma
cells
.

Moreover
,
pimpinellin
inhibited
the
growth
of
tumor
cells
via
the
induction
of
tumor
cell
apoptosis
.

Backgrounds
:
Electronic
medical
records
(
EMR
)
form
a
rich
repository
of
information
that
could
benefit
public
health
.

We
asked
how
structured
and
free-text
narrative
EMR
data
should
be
combined
to
improve
epidemic
surveillance
for
acute
respiratory
infections
(
ARI
)
.

Methods
:
Eight
previously
characterized
ARI
case
detection
algorithms
(
CDA
)
were
applied
to
historical
EMR
entries
to
create
authentic
time
series
of
daily
ARI
case
counts
(
background
)
.

An
epidemic
model
simulated
influenza
cases
(
injection
)
.

From
the
time
of
the
injection
,
cluster-detection
statistics
were
applied
daily
on
paired
background+injection
(
combined
)
and
background-only
time
series
.

This
cycle
was
then
repeated
with
the
injection
shifted
to
each
week
of
the
evaluation
year
.

We
computed
:
a
)
the
time
from
injection
to
the
first
statistical
alarm
uniquely
found
in
the
combined
dataset
(
Detection
Delay
)
;
b
)
how
often
alarms
originated
in
the
background-only
dataset
(
false-alarm
rate
,
or
FAR
)
;
and
c
)
the
number
of
cases
found
within
these
false
alarms
(
Caseload
)
.

For
each
CDA
,
we
plotted
the
Detection
Delay
as
a
function
of
FAR
or
Caseload
,
over
a
broad
range
of
alarm
thresholds
.

Results
:
CDAs
that
combined
text
analyses
seeking
ARI
symptoms
in
clinical
notes
with
provider-assigned

rather
than
the
sensitivity
of

lowered
Detection
Delay
at
any
given

.

Conclusion
:
An
empiric
approach
can
guide
the
integration
of
EMR
data
into
case-detection
methods
that
improve
both
the
timeliness
and

Background
:
The
innate
immune
response
is
the
first
line
of
defence
against
invading
pathogens
and
is
regulated
by
complex
signalling
and
transcriptional
networks
.

Systems
biology
approaches
promise
to
shed
new
light
on
the
regulation
of
innate
immunity
through
the
analysis
and
modelling
of
these
networks
.

A
key
initial
step
in
this
process
is
the
contextual
cataloguing
of
the
components
of
this
system
and
the
molecular
interactions
that
comprise
these

.

InnateDB

.

Results
:
Here
,
we
describe
the
InnateDB
curation
project
,
which
is
manually
annotating
the
human

mouse
innate

interactome
in
rich
contextual
detail
,
and
present
our
novel
curation
software
system
,
which
has
been
developed
to
ensure
interactions
are
curated
in
a
highly
accurate
and
data-standards
compliant
manner
.

To
date
,
over
13,000
interactions
(
protein
,
DNA
and
RNA
)
have
been
curated
from
the
biomedical
literature
.

Here
,
we
present
data
,
illustrating
how
InnateDB
curation
of
the
innate
immunity
interactome
has
greatly
enhanced
network
and
pathway
annotation
available
for
systems-level
analysis
and
discuss
the
challenges
that
face
such
curation
efforts
.

Significantly
,
we
provide
several
lines
of
evidence
that
analysis
of
the
innate
immunity
interactome
has
the
potential
to
identify
novel
signalling
,
transcriptional
and
post-transcriptional
regulators
of
innate
immunity
.

Additionally
,
these
analyses
also
provide
insight
into
the
cross-talk
between
innate
immunity
pathways
and
other
biological
processes
,
such
as
adaptive
immunity
,
cancer
and
diabetes
,
and
intriguingly
,
suggests
links
to
other
pathways
,
which
as
yet
,
have
not
been
implicated
in
the
innate
immune
response
.

In
summary
,
curation
of
the
InnateDB
interactome
provides
a
wealth
of
information
to
enable
systems-level

Background
:
Lower
respiratory

(
CAP
)
is
a
common
infectious
disease
that
is
associated
with
significant
morbidity
and
mortality
.

The
patterns
of
aetiological
pathogens
differ
by
region
and
country
.

Special
attention
must
be
paid
to
CAP
in
Southeast
Asia
(

)
,
a
region
facing
rapid
demographic
transition
.

Estimates
burden
and
aetiological
patterns
of
CAP
are
essential
for
the
clinical
and
public
health
management
.

The
purposes
of
the
study
are
to
determine
the

,
clinical
pictures
and
risk
factors
of

.

Methods
:
A
prospective
surveillance
for

was
conducted
in
Khanh
Hoa

admitted
to
a
provincial
hospital
from
September
2009
to
August
2010
were
enrolled
in
the

.

Patients
were
classified
into
CAP
and
non-pneumonic
LRTI
(
NPLRTI
)
according
to
the
radiological
findings
.

Bacterial

Of
all
367
LRTI
episodes
examined
,
174
(

Older
age
,
the
presence
of

common
.

Conclusions
:
The
current
adult
CAP
incidence
in
Vietnam
was
relatively
low
;
this
result
was
mainly
attributed
to
the
young
age
of
our
study
population
.

During
the
replication
of
human
cytomegalovirus
(
HCMV
)
genome
,
the
viral
DNA
polymerase
subunit
UL44
plays
a
key
role
,
as
by
binding
both
DNA
and
the
polymerase
catalytic
subunit
it
confers
processivity
to
the
holoenzyme
.

However
,
several
lines
of
evidence
suggest
that
UL44
might
have
additional
roles
during
virus
life
cycle
.

To
shed
light
on
this
,
we
searched
for
cellular
partners
of
UL44
by
yeast
two-hybrid
screenings
.

Intriguingly
,
we
discovered
the
interaction
of
UL44
with
Ubc9
,
an
enzyme
involved
in
the
covalent
conjugation
of
SUMO
(
Small
Ubiquitin-related
MOdifier
)
to
cellular
and
viral
proteins
.

We
found
that
UL44
can
be
extensively
sumoylated
not
only
in
a
cell-free
system
and
in
transfected
cells
,
but
also
in
HCMVinfected
cells
,
in
which
about
50
%
of
the
protein
resulted
to
be
modified
at
late
times
post-infection
,
when
viral
genome
replication
is
accomplished
.

Mass
spectrometry
studies
revealed
that
UL44
possesses
multiple
SUMO
target
sites
,
located
throughout
the
protein
.

Remarkably
,
we
observed
that
binding
of
UL44
to
DNA
greatly
stimulates
its
sumoylation
both
in
vitro
and
in
vivo
.

In
addition
,
we
showed
that
overexpression
of
SUMO
alters
the
intranuclear
distribution
of
UL44
in
HCMV-infected
cells
,
and
enhances
both
virus
production
and
DNA
replication
,
arguing
for
an
important
role
for
sumoylation
in
HCMV
life
cycle
and
UL44
function
(
s
)
.

These
data
report
for
the
first
time
the
sumoylation
of
a
viral
processivity
factor
and
show
that
there
is
a
functional
interplay
between
the
HCMV
UL44
protein
and
the
cellular
sumoylation
system

respiratory
syndrome
(
MERS
)
is
an
acute
,
high-mortality-rate
,
severe
infectious
disease
caused
by
an
emerging
MERS
coronavirus
(
MERS-CoV
)
that
causes
severe
respiratory
diseases
.

The
continuous
spread
and
great
pandemic
potential
of
MERS-CoV
make
it
necessarily
important
to
develop
effective
vaccines
.

We
previously
demonstrated
that
the
application
of
Gram-positive
enhancer
matrix
(
GEM
)
particles
as
a
bacterial
vector
displaying
the
MERS-CoV
receptor-binding
domain
(
RBD
)
is
a
very
promising
MERS
vaccine
candidate
that
is
capable
of
producing
potential
neutralization
antibodies
.

We
have
also
used
the
rabies
virus
(
RV
)
as
a
viral
vector
to
design
a
recombinant
vaccine
by
expressing
the
MERS-CoV
S1
(
spike
)
protein
on
the
surface
of
the
RV
.

In
this
study
,
we
compared
the
immunological
efficacy
of
the
vaccine
candidates
in
BALB/c
mice
in
terms
of
the
levels
of
humoral
and
cellular
immune
responses
.

The
results
show
that
the
rabies
virus
vector-based
vaccine
can
induce
remarkably
earlier
antibody
response
and
higher
levels
of
cellular
immunity
than
the
GEM
particles
vector
.

However
,
the
GEM
particles
vector-based
vaccine
candidate
can
induce
remarkably
higher
antibody
response
,
even
at
a
very
low
dose
of
1
µg
.

These
results
indicate
that
vaccines
constructed
using
different
vaccine
vector
platforms
for
the
same
pathogen
have
different
rates
and
trends
in
humoral
and
cellular
immune
responses
in
the
same
animal
model
.

This
discovery
not
only
provides
more
alternative
vaccine
development
platforms
for
MERS-CoV
vaccine
development
,
but
also
provides
a
theoretical
basis
for
our
future
selection
of
vaccine
vector
platforms
for
other
specific
pathogens

Interferon-induced
transmembrane
(
IFITM
)
proteins
are
a
family
of
viral
restriction
factors
that
inhibit
the
entry
processes
of
several
pathogenic
viruses
,
including
influenza
A
virus
(
IAV
)
,
in
vitro
.

Here
we
report
that
IAV-infected
knockout
mice
lacking
the
Ifitm
locus
on
chromosome
7
exhibited
accelerated
disease
progression
,
greater
mortality
,
and
higher
pulmonary
and
systemic
viral
burdens
as
compared
to
wild
type
controls
.

We
further
observed
that
the
phenotype
of
Ifitm3-specific
knockout
mice
was
indistinguishable
from
that
of
mice
lacking
the
entire
Ifitm
locus
.

Ifitm3
was
expressed
by
IAV
target
cells
including
alveolar
type
II
pneumocytes
and
tracheal/bronchial
respiratory
epithelial
cells
.

Robust
Ifitm3
expression
was
also
observed
in
several
tissues
in
the
absence
of
infection
.

Among
murine
Ifitm
promoters
,
only
that
of
Ifitm3
could
be
induced
by
type
I
and
II
interferons
.

Ifitm3
could
also
be
upregulated
by
the
gp130
cytokines
IL-6
and
oncostatin
M
on
cells
expressing
appropriate
receptors
,
suggesting
that
multiple
cytokine
signals
could
contribute
to
Ifitm3
expression
in
a
cell
or
tissue-specific
manner
.

Collectively
,
these
findings
establish
a
central
role
for
Ifitm3
in
limiting
acute
influenza
in
vivo
,
and
provide
further
insight

An
infectious
disease
characterized
with

bills
and
protruding
tongues
has
attacked
to
meat
ducks
in
China
since
March
2015
,
which
has
caused
ducks
poor
growth
and
enormous
economic
losses
to
duck
industry
of
China
.

It
was
eventually
proved
to
be
caused
by
parvovirus
after
pathogen
isolation
and
identification
.

As
the
genomic
sequence
analysis
showed
,
this
pathogen
shared
90.8-94.6
%
of
nucleotide
identity
with
goose
parvovirus
(
GPV
)
,
and
it
was
called
duck-origin
novel
goose
parvovirus
(
N-GPV
)
.

In
this
study
,
a
quantitative
loop-mediated
isothermal
amplification
(
qLAMP
)
assay
was
developed
for
the
rapid
diagnosis
of
N-GPV
.

A
set
of
four
specific
primers
,
two
inner
and
two
outer
,
were
designed
targeting
at

,
which
could
be
completed
within
60

on
a
real-time
PCR
instrument
for
quantitative
analysis
.

Specificity
test
of
LAMP
assay
showed
that
there
was
no
cross-reactivity
between
N-GPV
and
other
duck
pathogens
,
and
the
detection
limit
of
qLAMP
assay
was
1.0
×
10
2
copies/µL
.

The
repeatability
of
this
method
was
confirmed
by
interassay
and
intra-assay
tests
with
variability
ranging
from
0.74
to
2.25
%
.

The
results
have
indicated
that
the
qLAMP
assay
was
a
simple
,
rapid
,
accurate
,
sensitive
,
and
specific
method
for
detecting

Like
all
positive-sense
RNA
viruses
,
hepatitis
C
virus
(
HCV
)
induces
host
membrane
alterations
for
its
replication
termed
the
membranous
web
(
MW
)
.

Assembling
replication
factors
at
a
membranous
structure
might
facilitate
the
processes
necessary
for
genome
replication
and
packaging
and
shield
viral
components
from
host
innate
immune
defenses
.

The
biogenesis
of
the
HCV
MW
is
a
complex
process
involving
a
concerted
effort
of
HCV
nonstructural
proteins
with
a
growing
list
of
host
factors
.

Although
a
comprehensive
understanding
of
MW
formation
is
still
missing
,
a
number
of
important
viral
and
host
determinants
have
been
identified
.

This
review
will
summarize
the
recent
studies
that
have
led
to
our
current
knowledge
of
the
role
of
viral
and
host
factors
in
the
biogenesis
of
the
MWs
and
discuss
how
HCV
uses
this
specialized
membrane
structure
for
its
replication
.

Researchers
routinely
adopt
molecular
clock
assumptions
in
conducting
sequence
analyses
to
estimate
dates
for
viral
origins
in
humans
.

We
used
computational
methods
to
examine
the
extent
to
which
this
practice
can
result
in
inaccurate
'retrodiction
.
'

Failing
to
account
for
dynamic
molecular
evolution
can
affect
greatly
estimating
index
case
dates
,
resulting
in
an
overestimated
age
for
the
SARS-CoV-human
infection
,
for
instance
.

DNA
sequences
seen
in
the
normal
character-based
representation
appear
to
have
a
formidable
mixing
of
the
four
nucleotides
without
any
apparent
order
.

Nucleotide
frequencies
and
distributions
in
the
sequences
have
been
studied
extensively
,
since
the
simple
rule
given
by
Chargaff
almost
a
century
ago
that
equates
the
total
number
of
purines
to
the
pyrimidines
in
a
duplex
DNA
sequence
.

While
it
is
difficult
to
trace
any
relationship
between
the
bases
from
studies
in
the
character
representation
of
a
DNA
sequence
,
graphical
representations
may
provide
a
clue
.

These
novel
representations
of
DNA
sequences
have
been
useful
in
providing
an
overview
of
base
distribution
and
composition
of
the
sequences
and
providing
insights
into
many
hidden
structures
.

We
report
here
our
observation
based
on
a
graphical
representation
that
the
intra-purine
and
intra-pyrimidine
differences
in
sequences
of
conserved
genes
generally
follow
a
quadratic
distribution
relationship
and
show
that
this
may
have
arisen
from
mutations
in
the
sequences
over
evolutionary
time
scales
.

From
this
hitherto
undescribed
relationship
for
the
gene
sequences
considered
in
this
report
we
hypothesize
that
such
relationships
may
be
characteristic
of
these
sequences
and
therefore
could
become
a
barrier
to
large
scale
sequence
alterations
that
override
such
characteristics
,
perhaps
through
some
monitoring
process
inbuilt
in
the
DNA
sequences
.

Such
relationship
also
raises
the
possibility
of
intron
sequences
playing
an
important
role
in
maintaining
the
characteristics
and
could
be
indicative
of
possible
intron-late
phenomena
.

Human
coronaviruses
(
HCoVs
)
are
associated
with
a
variety
of
clinical
presentations
in
children
,
but
their
role
in
disease
remains
uncertain
.

The
objective
of
our
prospective
study
was
to
investigate
HCoVs
associations
with
various
clinical
presentations
in
hospitalized
children
up
to
6
years
of
age
.

Children
hospitalized
with

gastroenteritis
(
AGE

,
or

,
and
children
admitted
for
elective
surgical
procedures
(
healthy
controls
)
were
included
in
the
study
.

In
patients
with
AB
,
AGE
,
and
FS
,
a
nasopharyngeal
(
NP

swab
and
blood
sample
were
obtained
upon
admission
and
the
follow-up
visit
14
days
later
,
whereas
in
children
with
AGE
a
stool
sample
was
also
acquired
upon
admission
;
in
healthy
controls
a
NP
swab
and
stool
sample
were
taken
upon
admission
.

Amplification
of
polymerase
1b
gene
was
used
to
detect
HCoVs
in
the
specimens
.

HCoVs-positive
specimens
were
also
examined
for
the
presence
of
several
other
viruses
.

HCoVs
were
most
often
detected
in
children
with
FS
(
19/192
,
9
.9
%
,
95
%

,
followed
by
children
with
AGE

19/218
,
8.7
%
,
95

and

(
20/308
,
6.5
%
,
95
%
CI
:
4.0-9.8
%
)
.

The
presence
of
other
viruses
was
a
common
finding
,
most
frequent
in
the
group
of
children
with
AB
(
19/20
,
95
%
,
95
%
CI
:
75.1-99.8
%
)
,
followed
by
FS
(
10/19
,
52.6
%
,
95
%
CI
:
28.9-75.6
%
)
and
AGE
(
7/19
,
36.8
%
,
95
%
CI
:
16.3-61.6
%
)
.

In
healthy
control
children
HCoVs
were
detected
in
3/156
(
1.9
%
,
95
%
CI
:
0.4-5.5
%
)
NP
swabs
and
1/150
(
0.7
%
,
95
%
CI
:
0.02-3.3
%
)
stool
samples
.

It
seems
that
an
etiological
role
of
HCoVs
is
most
likely
in
children
with
FS
,
considering
that
they
had
a
higher
proportion
of
positive
HCoVs
results
than
patients
with
AB
and
those
with
AGE
,
and
had
the
highest
viral
load
;
however
,
the
co-detection
of
other
viruses
was
52.6
%
.

Human
metapneumovirus
(

is
a
widely
distributed
pathogen
responsible
for
acute
upper

lower
respiratory
infections
of
varying
severity
.

Previously
,
we
reported
that
Nsulfonated

of
poly

efficiently
inhibit

,
we
show
a
dose
dependent
inhibition
of
hMPV
infection
by
NSPAHs
in
LLC-MK2
cells
.

The
results
showed
strong
antiviral
properties
of
NSPAHs
.

While
the
activity
of
NSPAHs
is
comparable
to
those
of
carrageenans
,
they
show
better
physicochemical
properties
and
may
be
delivered
at
high
concentrations
.

The
functional
assays
showed
that
tested
polymers
block
hMPV
release
from
infected
cells
and
,
consequently
,
constrain
virus
spread
.

Moreover
,
further
studies
on
viruses
utilizing
different
egress
mechanisms
suggest
that
observed
antiviral
effect
depend
on
selective
inhibition
of
viruses
budding
from
the

Pancreatic
cancer
is
the
5
th
leading
cause
of
cancer
deaths
,
and
there
are
no
effective
treatments
.

We
developed
a
poxvirus
platform
vaccine
with
improved
immunogenicity
and
inserted
the
mesothelin
gene
to
create
an
anti-mesothelin
cancer
vaccine
.

Mesothelin
expression
is
mostly
restricted
to
tumors
in
adult
mammals
and
thus
may
be
a
good
target
for
cancer
treatment
.

We
show
here
that
the
modified
vaccinia
virus
Ankara
(
MVA
)
virus
expressing
mesothelin
and
the
enhanced
MVA
virus
missing
the
immunosuppressive
A35
gene
and
expressing
mesothelin
were
both
safe
in
mice

were
able
to
induce
IFN-gamma
secreting
T
cells
in
response
to
mesothelin
expressing
tumor
cells
.

In
addition
,
the
MVA
virus
has
oncolytic
properties
in
vitro
as
it
can
replicate
in
and
kill
Panc02
pancreatic
adenocarcinoma
cell
line
tumor
cells
,
even
though
it
is
unable
to
replicate
in
most
mammalian
cells
.

Deletion
of
the
A35
gene
in
MVA
improved
T
cell
responses
as
expected
.

However
,
we
were
unable
to
demonstrate
inhibition
of
Panc02
tumor
growth
in
immunocompetent
mice
with
pre-vaccination
of
mice
,
boosts
,
or
even
intratumoral
injections
of
the
recombinant
viruses
.

Vaccine
efficacy
may
be
limited
by
shedding
of
mesothelin
from
tumor
cells

creating
a
protective
screen
from
the

During
summer
2007
Italy
has
experienced
an
epidemic
caused
by
Chikungunya
virus
-the
first
large
outbreak
documented
in
a
temperate
climate
country
-with
approximately
161
laboratory
confirmed
cases
concentrated
in
two
bordering
villages
in
North-Eastern
Italy
comprising
3,968
inhabitants
.

The
seroprevalence
was
recently
estimated
to
be
10.2
%
.

In
this
work
we
provide
estimates
of
the
transmission
potential
of
the
virus
and
we
assess
the
efficacy
of
the
measures
undertaken
by
public
health
authorities
to
control
the
epidemic
spread
.

To
such
aim
,
we
developed
a
model
describing
the
temporal
dynamics
of
the
competent
vector
,
known
as
Aedes
albopictus
,
explicitly
depending
on
climatic
factors
,
coupled
to
an
epidemic
transmission
model
describing
the
spread
of
the
epidemic
in
both
humans
and
mosquitoes
.

The
cumulative
number
of
notified
cases
predicted
by
the
model
was
185
on
average
(
95
%
CI
117-278
)
,
in
good
agreement
with
observed
data
.

The
probability
of
observing
a
major
outbreak
after
the
introduction
of
an
infective
human
case
was
estimated
to
be
in
the
range
of
32
%
-76
%
.

We
found
that
the
basic
reproduction
number
was
in
the
range
of
1.8-6
but
it
could
have
been
even
larger
,
depending
on
the
density
of
mosquitoes
,
which
in
turn
depends
on
seasonal
meteorological
effects
,
besides
other
local
abiotic
factors
.

These
results
confirm
the
increasing
risk
of
tropical
vector-borne
diseases
in
temperate
climate
countries
,
as
a
consequence
of
globalization
.

However
,
our
results
show
that
an
epidemic
can
be
controlled
by
performing
a
timely
intervention
,
even
if
the
transmission
potential
of
Chikungunya
virus
is
sensibly
high
.

have
led
to
improved
progression-free
survival
of
many
patients
;
however
the
therapies
are
toxic
,
rarely
achieve
durable
long-term
complete
responses
and
are
not
curative
.

the
ccRCC
milieu
to
combat
T
cell
exhaustion
is
an
innovation
in
this
field
that
should
provide
renewed

Melioidosis
,
caused
by
the
bacterium
Burkholderia
pseudomallei
,
is
an
infectious
disease
of
humans
or
animals
,
and
the
specific
environmental
conditions
that
are
present
in
western
Indian
Ocean
islands
are
particularly
suitable
for
the
establishment/survival
of
B.
pseudomallei
.

Indeed
,
an
increasing
number
of
new
cases
have
been
reported
in
this
region
(
Madagascar
,
Mauritius
,
Réunion
(
France
)
,
and
Seychelles
,
except
Comoros
and
Mayotte
(
France
)
)
,
and
are
described
in
this
review
.

Our
review
clearly
points
out
that
further
studies
are
needed
in
order
to
investigate
the
real
incidence
and
burden
of
melioidosis
in
the
western
Indian
Ocean
and
especially
Madagascar
,
since
it
is
likely
to
be
higher
than
currently
reported
.

Thus
,
research
and
surveillance
priorities
were
recommended
(
i
)
to
improve
awareness
of
melioidosis
in
the
population
and
among
clinicians
;
(
ii
)
to
improve
diagnostics
,
in
order
to
provide
rapid
and
effective
treatment
;
(
iii
)
to
implement
a
surveillance
and
reporting
system
in
the
western
Indian
Ocean
;
and
(
iv
)
to
investigate
the
presence
of
B.
pseudomallei
in
environmental
samples
,
since
we
have
demonstrated
its
presence
in
soil
samples
originating
from
the
yard
of
a
Madagascan

.

The
RNA
synthesis
of
porcine
reproductive
and
respiratory
syndrome
virus
(
PRRSV
)
,
a
positive-strand
RNA
virus
,
is
compartmentalized
in
virus-induced
double-membrane
vesicles
where
viral
proteins
and
some
cellular
proteins
assemble
into
replication
and
transcription
complexes
(
RTCs
)
.

The
viral
replicase
proteins
are
the
major
components
of
the
RTCs
but
the
physical
associations
among
these
non-structural
proteins
(
nsps
)
remain
elusive
.

In
this
study
,
we
investigated
the
potential
interactions
between
PRRSV
nsps
by
yeast
two-hybrid
(
Y2H
)
,
bimolecular
fluorescence
complementation
(
BiFC
)
and
pull-down
assays
.

Our
analyses
revealed
a
complex
network
of
interactions
involving
most
of
PRRSV
nsps
.

Among
them
,
nsp9
and
nsp12
were
identified
as
the
hubs
of
the
nsp
interactome
;
transmembrane
proteins
nsp2
and
nsp5
both
interacted
with
nsp3
,
indicating
that
the
three
membrane-bound
proteins
might
bind
together
to
form
the
scaffold
to
support
the
association
of
RTCs
with
the
intracellular
membrane
.

The
PRRSV
nsp
interactions
identified
in
this
study
may
provide
valuable
clues
for
future
researches
on
the
RTC
formation
and
function
.

RNA
interference
(
RNAi
)
is
rapidly
becoming
an
important
method
for
analyzing
gene
functions
in
many
eukaryotes
and
holds
promise
for
the
development
of
therapeutic
gene
silencing
.

The
induction
of
RNAi
relies
on
small
silencing
RNAs
,
which
affect
specific
messenger
RNA
(
mRNA
)
degradation
.

Two
types
of
small
RNA
molecules
,
i.e
.

small
interfering
RNAs
(
siRNAs
)
and
microRNAs
(
miRNAs
)
,
are
central
to
RNAi
.

Drug
discovery
studies
and
novel
treatments
of
siRNAs
are
currently
targeting
a
wide
range
of
diseases
,
including
various
viral
infections
and
cancers
.

Lung
diseases
in
general
are
attractive
targets
for
siRNA
therapeutics
because
of
their
lethality
and
prevalence
.

In
addition
,
the
lung
is
anatomically
accessible
to
therapeutic
agents
via
the
intrapulmonary
route
.

Recently
,
increasing
evidence
indicates
that
miRNAs
play
an
important
role
in
lung
abnormalities
,
such
as
inflammation
and
oncogenesis
.

Therefore
,
miRNAs
are
being
targeted
for
therapeutic
purposes
.

In
this
review
,
we
present
strategies
for
RNAi
delivery
and
discuss
the
current
state-of-the-art
RNAi-based
therapeutics
for
various
lung
diseases
.

The
functional
role
of
ELR-positive
CXC
chemokines
in
host
defense
during
acute
viral-induced
encephalomyelitis
was
determined
.

Inoculation
of
the
neurotropic
JHM
strain
of
mouse
hepatitis
virus
(
JHMV
)
into
the
central
nervous
system
(
CNS
)
of
mice
resulted
in
the
rapid
mobilization
of
PMNs
expressing
the
chemokine
receptor
CXCR2
into
the
blood
.

Migration
of
PMNs
to
the
CNS
coincided
with
increased
expression
of
transcripts
specific
for
the
CXCR2
ELR-positive
chemokine
ligands
CXCL1
,
CXCL2
,
and
CXCL5
within
the
brain
.

Treatment
of
JHMV-infected
mice
with
anti-CXCR2
blocking
antibody
reduced
PMN
trafficking
into
the
CNS
by
.95
%
,
dampened
MMP-9
activity
,
and
abrogated
blood-brain-barrier
(
BBB
)
breakdown
.

Correspondingly
,
CXCR2
neutralization
resulted
in
diminished
infiltration
of
virus-specific
T
cells
,
an
inability
to
control
viral
replication
within
the
brain
,
and
100
%
mortality
.

Blocking
CXCR2
signaling
did
not
impair
the
generation
of
virus-specific
T
cells
,
indicating
that
CXCR2
is
not
required
to
tailor
anti-JHMV
T
cell
responses
.

Evaluation
of
mice
in
which
CXCR2
is
genetically
silenced
(
CXCR22/2
mice
)
confirmed
that
PMNs
neither
expressed
CXCR2
nor
migrated
in
response
to
ligands
CXCL1
,
CXCL2
,
or
CXCL5
in
an
in
vitro
chemotaxis
assay
.

Moreover
,
JHMV
infection
of
CXCR22/2
mice
resulted
in
an
approximate
60
%
reduction
of
PMN
migration
into
the
CNS
,
yet
these
mice
survived
infection
and
controlled
viral
replication
within
the
brain
.

Treatment
of
JHMV-infected
CXCR22/2
mice
with
anti-CXCR2
antibody
did
not
modulate
PMN
migration
nor
alter
viral
clearance
or
mortality
,
indicating
the
existence
of
compensatory
mechanisms
that
facilitate
sufficient
migration
of
PMNs
into
the
CNS
in
the
absence
of
CXCR2
.

Collectively
,
these
findings
highlight
a
previously
unappreciated
role
for
ELR-positive
chemokines
in
enhancing
host
defense
during
acute
viral
infections
of
the
CNS
.

Recent
experimental
studies
provide
evidence
indicating
that
manipulation
of
the
mononuclear
phagocyte
phenotype
could
be
a
feasible
approach
to
alter
the
severity
and
persistence
of
pulmonary
injury
and
fibrosis
.

Mineralocorticoid
receptor
(
MR
)
has
been
reported
as
a
target
to
regulate
macrophage
polarization
.

The
present
work
was
designed
to
investigate
the
therapeutic
potential
of
MR
antagonism
in
bleomycin-induced
acute
lung
injury
and
fibrosis
.

We
first
demonstrated
the
expression
of
MR
in
magnetic
bead-purified
Ly6G-/
CD11b+
circulating
monocytes
and
in
alveolar
macrophages
harvested
in
bronchoalveolar
lavage
fluid
(
BALF
)
from
C57BL/6
mice
.

Then
,
a
pharmacological
intervention
study
using
spironolactone
(
20mg/kg/day
by
oral
gavage
)
revealed
that
MR
antagonism

to
decreased
inflammatory

Moreover
,
serial

revealed
that
spironolactone
could
partially
inhibit

reduce

activation
(

remained
unaffected
by
spironolactone
during
investigation
.

The
present
work
provides
the
experimental
evidence
that
spironolactone
could
attenuate
bleomycin-induced

Porcine
epidemic
diarrhea
virus
(
PEDV
)
is
an
alphacoronavirus
that
has
a
significant
agricultural
and
economic
impact
due
to
the
high
mortality
rate
associated
with
infection
of
neonatal
piglets
.

Like
other
coronaviruses
,
PEDV
makes
use
of
a
large
,
trimeric
spike
(
S
)
glycoprotein
to
mediate
membrane
fusion
and
gain
entry
into
host
cells
.

Despite
the
importance
of
the
spike
protein
in
viral
entry
and
host
immune
responses
,
high-resolution
structural
information
concerning
this
large
macromolecular
machine
has
been
difficult
to
obtain
.

Here
,
we
report
the
cryo-electron
microscopy
structure
of
the
PEDV
S
protein
in
the
prefusion
conformation
at
a
resolution
of
3.1
Å
.

Our
studies
revealed
that
the
sialic
acid-binding
domain
at
the
N
terminus
of
the
S1
subunit
has
an
orientation
that
is
substantially
different
from
that
observed
in
the
previously
determined
spike
structure
from
human
alphacoronavirus
NL63
.

We
also
observed
dissociated
S1
subunit
trimers
wherein
the
putative
receptor-binding
domains
exist
in
a
conformation
differing
from
that
observed
in
the
intact
spike
proteins
,
suggesting
that
the
PEDV
receptor-binding
domain
undergoes
conformational
rearrangements
akin
to
those
that
have
been
described
in
the
related
betacoronaviruses
.

Collectively
,
these
data
provide
new
insights
into
the
biological
processes
that
mediate
alphacoronavirus
attachment
,
receptor
engagement
,
and
fusion
triggering
while
also
identifying
a
source
of
conformational
heterogeneity
that
could
be
manipulated
to
improve
PEDV
vaccine
antigens
.

IMPORTANCE
Coronavirus
spike
proteins
are
large
,
densely
glycosylated
macromolecular
machines
that
mediate
receptor
binding
and
membrane
fusion
to
facilitate
entry
into
host
cells
.

This
report
describes
the
atomic-resolution
structure
of
the
spike
protein
from
porcine
epidemic
diarrhea
virus
,
a
pathogenic
alphacoronavirus
that
causes
severe
agricultural
damage
.

The
structure
reveals
a
novel
position
for
the
sialic
acid-binding
attachment
domain
in
the
intact
spike
.

We
also
observed
shed
fusion-suppressive
capping
subunits
that
displayed
the
putative
receptorbinding
domain
in
an
accessible
conformation
.

These
observations
provide
a
basis
for
understanding
the
molecular
mechanisms
that
drive
the
earliest
stages
of
alphacoronavirus
infection
and
will
inform
future
efforts
to
rationally
design
vaccines
.

Coronaviruses
are
enveloped
positive-stranded
RNA
viruses
that
replicate
in
the
cytoplasm
.

To
deliver
their
nucleocapsid
into
the
host
cell
,
they
rely
on
the
fusion
of
their
envelope
with
the
host
cell
membrane
.

The
spike
glycoprotein
(
S
)
mediates
virus
entry
and
is
a
primary
determinant
of
cell
tropism
and
pathogenesis
.

It
is
classified
as
a
class
I
fusion
protein
,
and
is
responsible
for
binding
to
the
receptor
on
the
host
cell
as
well
as
mediating
the
fusion
of
host
and
viral
membranes-A
process
driven
by
major
conformational
changes
of
the
S
protein
.

This
review
discusses
coronavirus
entry
mechanisms
focusing
on
the
different
triggers
used
by
coronaviruses
to
initiate
the
conformational
change
of
the
S
protein
:
receptor
binding
,
low
pH
exposure
and
proteolytic
activation
.

We
also
highlight
commonalities
between
coronavirus
S
proteins
and
other
class
I
viral
fusion
proteins
,
as
well
as
distinctive
features
that
confer
distinct
tropism
,
pathogenicity
and
host
interspecies
transmission
characteristics
to
coronaviruses
.

Background
:
The
data
contribute
to
a
better
understanding
of
the
circulation
of
influenza
viruses
especially
in
North-Africa
.

Objective
:
The
objective
of
this
surveillance
was
to
detect
severe
influenza
cases
,
identify
their
epidemiological
and
virological
characteristics
and
assess
their
impact
on
the
healthcare
system
.

We
describe
in
this
report
the
findings
of
laboratory-based
surveillance
of
human
cases
of
influenza
virus
and
other
respiratory
viruses
'
infection
during
three
seasons
in
Tunisia
.

Objective
:
The
intent
of
this
study
was
to
examine
the
recovery
of
individuals
who
had
been
hospitalized
for
severe
acute
respiratory
syndrome
(
SARS
)
in
the
year
following
their
discharge
from
the
hospital
.

Parameters
studied
included
serum
levels
of
SARS
coronavirus
(
SARS-CoV
)
IgG
antibody
,
tests
of
lung
function
,
and
imaging
data
to
evaluate
changes
in
lung
fibrosis
.

In
addition
,
we
explored
the
incidence
of
femoral
head
necrosis
in
some
of
the
individuals
recovering
from
SARS
.

The
subjects
of
this
study
were
383
clinically
diagnosed
SARS
patients
in
Beijing
,
China
.

They
were
tested
regularly
for
serum
levels
of
SARS-CoV
IgG
antibody
and
lung
function
and
were
given
chest
X-rays
and/or
high
resolution
computerized
tomography
(
HRCT
)
examinations
at
the
Chinese
PLA
General
Hospital
during
the
12
months
that
followed
their
release
from
the
hospital
.

Those
individuals
who
were
found
to
have
lung
diffusion
abnormities
(
transfer
coefficient
for
carbon
monoxide
[
D
L
CO
]
<
80
%
of
predicted
value
[
pred
]
)
received
regular
lung
function
tests
and
HRCT
examinations
in
the
follow-up
phase
in
order
to
document
the
changes
in
their
lung
condition
.

Some
patients
who
complained
of
joint
pain
were
given
magnetic
resonance
imaging
(
MRI
)
examinations
of
their
femoral
heads
.

Findings
:
Of
all
the
subjects
,
81.2
%
(
311
of
383
patients
)
tested
positive
for
serum
SARS-CoV
IgG
.

Of
those
testing
positive
,
27.3
%
(
85
of
311
patients
)
were
suffering
from
lung
diffusion
abnormities
(
D
L
CO
<
80
%
pred
)
and
21.5
%
(
67
of
311
patients
)
exhibited
lung
fibrotic
changes
.

In
the
12
month
duration
of
this
study
,
all
of
the
40
patients
with
lung
diffusion
abnormities
who
were
examined
exhibited
some
improvement
of
lung
function
and
fibrosis
detected
by
radiography
.

Of
the
individuals
receiving
MRI
examinations
,
23.1
%
(
18
of
78
patients
)
showed
signs
of
femoral
head
necrosis
.

The
lack
of
sero-positive
SARS-CoV
in
some
individuals
suggests
that
there
may
have
been
some
misdiagnosed
cases
among
the
subjects
included
in
this
study
.

Of
those
testing
positive
,
the
serum
levels
of
SARS-CoV
IgG
antibody
decreased
significantly
during
the
12
months
after
hospital
discharge
.

Additionally
,
we
found
that
the
individuals
who
had
lung
fibrosis
showed
some
spontaneous
recovery
.

Finally
,
some
of
the
subjects
developed
femoral
head
necrosis
.

Background
:
Interferon
inducible
transmembrane
proteins
(
IFITMs
)
have
diverse
roles
,
including
the
control
of
cell
proliferation
,
promotion
of
homotypic
cell
adhesion
,
protection
against
viral
infection
,
promotion
of
bone
matrix
maturation
and
mineralisation
,
and
mediating
germ
cell
development
.

Most
IFITMs
have
been
well
characterised
in
human
and
mouse
but
little
published
data
exists
for
other
animals
.

This
study
characterised
IFITMs
in
two
distantly
related
marsupial
species
,
the
Australian
tammar
wallaby
and
the
South
American
grey
short-tailed
opossum
,
and
analysed
the
phylogeny
of
the
IFITM
family
in
vertebrates
.

Results
:
Five
IFITM
paralogues
were
identified
in
both
the
tammar
and
opossum
.

As
in
eutherians
,
most
marsupial
IFITM
genes
exist
within
a
cluster
,
contain
two
exons
and
encode
proteins
with
two
transmembrane
domains
.

Only
two
IFITM
genes
,
IFITM5
and
IFITM10
,
have
orthologues
in
both
marsupials
and
eutherians
.

IFITM5
arose
in
bony
fish
and
IFITM10
in
tetrapods
.

The
bone-specific
expression
of
IFITM5
appears
to
be
restricted
to
therian
mammals
,
suggesting
that
its
specialised
role
in
bone
production
is
a
recent
adaptation
specific
to
mammals
.

IFITM10
is
the
most
highly
conserved
IFITM
,
sharing
at
least
85
%
amino
acid
identity
between
birds
,
reptiles
and
mammals
and
suggesting
an
important
role
for
this
presently
uncharacterised
protein
.

Conclusions
:
Like
eutherians
,
marsupials
also
have
multiple
IFITM
genes
that
exist
in
a
gene
cluster
.

The
differing
expression
patterns
for
many
of
the
paralogues
,
together
with
poor
sequence
conservation
between
species
,
suggests
that
IFITM
genes
have
acquired
many
different
roles
during
vertebrate
evolution
.

Widespread
geographic
movement
and
extensive
comingling
of
exhibition
swine
facilitates
the
spread
and
transmission
of
infectious
pathogens
.

Nasal
samples
were
collected
from
2862
pigs
at
102
exhibitions
and
tested
for
five
pathogens
.

At
least
one
pathogen
was
molecularly
detected
in
pigs
at
63
(
61.8
%
)
exhibitions
.

Influenza
A
virus
was
most
prevalent
and
was
detected
in
498
(
17.4
%
)
samples
.

Influenza
D
virus
was
detected
in
two
(
0.07
%
)
samples
.

More
than
one
pathogen
was
detected
in
165
(
5.8
%
)
samples
.

Influenza
A
virus
remains
a
top
threat
to
animal
and
human
health
,
but
other
pathogens
may
be
disseminated
through
the
exhibition
swine
population
.

Background
:
Primary
Immunodeficiencies
(
PIDs
)
are
a
heterogeneous
group
of
genetic
immune
disorders
.

While
some
PIDs
can
manifest
with
more
than
one
phenotype
,
signs
,
and
symptoms
of
various
PIDs
overlap
considerably
.

Recently
,
novel
defects
in
immune-related
genes
and
additional
variants
in
previously
reported
genes
responsible
for
PIDs
have
been
successfully
identified
by
Next
Generation
Sequencing
(
NGS
)
,
allowing
the
recognition
of
a
broad
spectrum
of
disorders
.

Objective
:
To
evaluate
the
strength
and
weakness
of
targeted
NGS
sequencing
using
custom-made
Ion
Torrent
and
Haloplex
(
Agilent
)
panels
for
diagnostics
and
research
purposes
.

Cifaldi
et
al
.

Methods
:
Five
different
panels
including
known
and
candidate
genes
were
used
to
screen
105
patients
with
distinct
PID
features
divided
in
three
main
PID
categories
:
T
cell
defects
,
Humoral
defects
and
Other
PIDs
.

The
Ion
Torrent
sequencing
platform
was
used
in
73
patients
.

Among
these
,
18
selected
patients
without
a
molecular
diagnosis
and
32
additional
patients
were
analyzed
by
Haloplex
enrichment
technology
.

Results
:
The
complementary
use
of
the
two
custom-made
targeted
sequencing
approaches
allowed
the
identification
of
causative
variants
in
28.6
%
(
n
=
30
)
of
patients
.

Twenty-two
out
of
73
(
34.6
%
)
patients
were
diagnosed
by
Ion
Torrent
.

In
this
group
20
were
included
in
the
SCID/CID
category
.

Eight
out
of
50
(
16
%
)
patients
were
diagnosed
by
Haloplex
workflow
.

Ion
Torrent
method
was
highly
successful
for
those
cases
with
welldefined
phenotypes
for
immunological
and
clinical
presentation
.

The
Haloplex
approach
was
able
to
diagnose
4
SCID/CID
patients
and
4
additional
patients
with
complex
and
extended
phenotypes
,
embracing
all
three
PID
categories
in
which
this
approach
was
more
efficient
.

Both
technologies
showed
good
gene
coverage
.

Conclusions
:
NGS
technology
represents
a
powerful
approach
in
the
complex
field
of
rare
disorders
but
its
different
application
should
be
weighted
.

A
relatively
small
NGS
target
panel
can
be
successfully
applied
for
a
robust
diagnostic
suspicion
,
while
when
the
spectrum
of
clinical
phenotypes
overlaps
more
than
one
PID
an
in-depth
NGS
analysis
is
required
,
including
also
whole
exome/genome
sequencing
to
identify
the
causative
gene
.

Containing
the
recent
West
African
outbreak
of
Ebola
virus
(
EBOV
)
required
the
deployment
of
substantial
global
resources
.

Operationally
,
health
workers
and
surveillance
teams
treated
cases
,
collected
genetic
samples
,
and
tracked
case
contacts
.

Despite
the
substantial
progress
in
analyzing
and
modeling
EBOV
epidemiological
data
,
a
complete
characterization
of
the
spatiotemporal
spread
of
Ebola
cases
remains
a
challenge
.

In
this
work
,
we
offer
a
novel
perspective
on
the
EBOV
epidemic
that
utilizes
virus
genome
sequences
to
inform
population-level
,
spatial
models
.

Calibrated
to
phylogenetic
linkages
,
these
dynamic
spatial
models
provide
unique
insight
into
the
disease
mobility
of
EBOV
in
Sierra
Leone
.

Further
,
we
developed
a
model
selection
framework
that
identifies
important
epidemiological
variables
influencing
the
spatiotemporal
propagation
of
EBOV
.

Consistent
with
other
investigations
,
our
results
show
that
the
spread
of
EBOV
during
the
beginning
and
middle
portions
of
the
epidemic
strongly
depended
on
the
size
of
and
distance
between
populations
.

Our
analysis
also
revealed
a
substantial
decline
in
the
dependence
on
population
size
at
the
end
of
the
epidemic
,
coinciding
with
the
large-scale
intervention
campaign
:
Operation
Western
Area
Surge
.

More
generally
,
we
believe
this
framework
,
pairing
molecular
diagnostics
with
dynamic
models
,
has
the
potential
to
be
a
powerful
forecasting
tool
along
with
offering
operationally-relevant
guidance
for
surveillance
and
sampling
strategies
during
an
epidemic
.

Background
:
Gene
expression
profiling
(
GEP
)
in
cells
obtained
from
peripheral
blood
has
shown
that
this
is
a
very
useful
approach
for
biomarker
discovery
and
for
studying
molecular
pathogenesis
of
prevalent
diseases
.

While
there
is
limited
literature
available
on
gene
expression
markers
associated
with
Chronic
Obstructive
Pulmonary
Disease
(
COPD
)
,
the
transcriptomic
picture
associated
with
critical
respiratory
illness
in
this
disease
is
not
known
at
the
present
moment
.

Findings
:
By
using
Agilent
microarray
chips
,
we
have
profiled
gene
expression
signatures
in
the
whole
blood
of
28
COPD
patients
hospitalized
with
different
degrees
of
respiratory
compromise.12
of
them
needed
of
admission
to
the
ICU
,
whilst
16
were
admitted
to
the
Respiratory
Medicine
Service
.

GeneSpring
GX
11.0
software
was
used
for
performing
statistical
comparisons
of
transcript
levels
between
ICU
and
non-ICU
patients
.

Ingenuity

analysis
8.5
(
IPA
)
and
the
Kyoto
Encyclopedia
of
Genes
and
Genomes
(

)
were
used
to
select
,
annotate
and
visualize
genes
by
function
and
pathway
(
gene
ontology
)
.

T-test
showed
evidence
of
1501
genes
differentially
expressed
between
ICU
and
non-ICU
patients
.

IPA
and
KEGG
analysis
of
the
most
representative
biological
functions
revealed
that
ICU
patients
had
increased
levels
of
neutrophil
gene
transcripts
,
being
[
cathepsin
G
(
CTSG
)
]
,
[
elastase
,
neutrophil
expressed
(
ELANE
)
]
,

,
[

)
]
,
azurocidin

(
AZU1
)
]
,
and
[
bactericidal/permeability-increasing
protein
(
BPI
)
]
the
most
representative
ones
.

Proteins
codified
by
these
genes
form
part
of
the
azurophilic
granules
of
neutrophils
and
are
involved
in
both
antimicrobial
defence
and
tissue
damage
.

This
``
neutrophil
signature
''
was
paralleled
by
the
necessity
of
advanced
respiratory
and
vital
support
,
and
the
presence
of
bacterial
infection
.

Conclusion
:
Study
of
transcriptomic
signatures
in
blood
suggests
an
essential
role
of
neutrophil
proteases
in
COPD
patients
with
critical
respiratory
illness
.

Measurement
and
modulation
of
the
expression
of
these
genes
could
present
an
option
for
clinical
monitoring
and
treatment
of
severe
COPD
exacerbations
.

The
population
of
hepatitis
B
combined
with
a
number
of
metabolic
disorders
is
increasing
significantly
.

Resveratrol
(
RSV
)
has
been
used
as
a
preclinical
drug
for
the
treatment
of
the
metabolic
disorders
.

However
,
the
impact
of
RSV
on
HBV
replication
remains
unknown
.

In
this
study
,
the
HBV-expressing
hepatocelluar
carcinoma
cell
line
and
mouse
model
created
by
hydrodynamic
injection
of
viral
DNA
were
used
.

We
found
that
RSV
activates
Sirt1
,
which
in
turn
deacetylates
PGC-1α
and
subsequently
increases
the
transcriptional
activity
of
PPARα
,
leading
to
the
enhanced
HBV
transcription
and
replication
in
vitro
and
in
vivo
.

In
addition
,
we
found
that
this
pathway
is
also
required
for
fastinginduced
HBV
transcription
.

Taken
together
,
this
study
identifies
that
RSV
enhances
HBV
transcription
and
replication
especially
acting
on
the
core
promoter
,
which
depends
on
Sirt1-PGC-1α-PPARα
pathway
.

We
conclude
that
RSV
may
exacerbate
the
progression
of
hepatitis
B
and
that
patients
with
hepatitis
B
infection
should
be
cautious
taking
RSV
as
a
dietary
supplement
.

Hepatitis
B
virus
(
HBV
)
is
a
small
enveloped
DNA
virus
,
which
has
chronically
infected
more
than
350
million
people
worldwide
and
caused
about
1
million
people
death
per
year
due
to
HBV-associated
liver
pathologies
1
.

Current
first-line
drugs
for
HBV
treatment
include
interferon
α
(
IFNα
)
and
nucleoside
or
nucleotide
analogues
.

While
these
drugs
can
minimize
HBV
replication
,
they
are
unable
to
cure
hepatitis
B
.

Therefore
,
protecting
HBV
patients
from
recurring
of
high
HBV
DNA
levels
to
minimize
the
liver
damages
is
still
one
of
the
most
important
strategies
for
managing
this
infectious
disease
.

Increasing
evidence
shows
that
,
as
a
result
of
sedentary
behaviors
and
poor
dietary
choices
,
more
and
more
people
suffer
metabolic
syndromes
2
.

It
correlates
with
an
increased
risk
of
diabetes
,
cardiovascular
diseases
and
stroke
3-6
.

HBV
patients
have
also
been
subjected
to
the
metabolic
disorders
and
,
at
present
,
the
prevalence
of
combined
metabolic
syndrome
and
chronic
HBV
infection
in
the
general
population
is
around
0.99-1.74
%
7-9
.

Although
the
interaction
between
chronic
hepatitis
B
and
metabolic
diseases
is
controversial
,
the
presence
of
both
chronic
HBV
infection
and
metabolic
syndrome
further
increases
the
risk
of
cirrhosis
and
hepatocellular
carcinoma
(
HCC
)
10-13
.

Resveratrol
(
trans-3,5,40-trihydroxystilbene
,
RSV
)
is
a
polyphenol
found
in
a
variety
of
plant
species
.

RSV
has
been
shown
to
exert
beneficial
effects
across
species
and
various
disease
models
.

It
prevents
or
slows
down
the
progression
of
a
variety
of
illnesses
,
especially
metabolic
diseases
14-16
.

Recently
it
has
been
shown
that
RSV
has
impacts
on
various
viral
infections
via
different
pathways
.

For
instance
,
RSV
has
been
shown
to
antagonize
the
respiratory
syncytial
virus
infection
in
the
lung
via
inhibiting
the
TRIF/TBK1/IRF-3
complex
17
.

RSV
was
also
found
to
be
effective
in
treating
influenza
virus
18
and
severe
acute
respiratory
syndrome
(
SARS
)
19
.

RSV
has
also
been
shown
to
synergize
with
several
antiretroviral
drugs
in
the
treatment
of
human
immunodeficiency
virus
(
HIV
)
20
and
herpes
simplex
viruses
(
HSV
)
21
.

In
an
in
vivo
study
,
25
%
RSV
cream
can
achieve
the
same
efficacy
in
the
treatment
of
HSV-1-induced
skin
lesions
on
the
abraded
epidermis
of
SKH1
mice
as
5
%
acyclovir
cream
22
.

In
addition
,
RSV
has
been
confirmed
to
enhance
replication
of
hepatitis
C
virus
,
which
indicates
that
RSV
was
not
suitable
as
an
antioxidant
therapy
for
chronic
hepatitis
C
23
.

However
,
the
effect
of
RSV
on
hepatitis
B
virus
remains
unclear
.

In
this
study
,
we
investigated
the
role
of
RSV
in
regulation
of
HBV
replication
.

Surprisingly
,
we
found
that
RSV
administration
dramatically
up-regulated
HBV
DNA
production
in
HBV-expressing
cells
and
the
mouse
model
via
activating
the
Sirt1-PGC-1α
-PPARα
pathway
.

Background
:
Human
infections
with
avian
influenza
A
(
H7N9
)
virus
are
associated
with
severe
illness
and
high
mortality
.

To
better
inform
triage
decisions
of
hospitalization
and
management
,
we
developed
a
clinical
prediction
rule
for
diagnosing
patients
with
A
(
H7N9
)
and
determined
its
predictive
performance
.

Methods
:
Clinical
details
on
presentation
of
adult
patients
hospitalized
with
either
A
(
H7N9
)
(
n
=
121
)
in
China
from
March
to
May
2013
or
other
causes
of
acute
respiratory
infections
(
n
=
2,603
)
in
Jingzhou
City
,
China
from
January
2010
through
September
2012
were
analyzed
.

A
clinical
prediction
rule
was
developed
using
a
two-step
coefficient-based
multivariable
logistic
regression
scoring
method
and
evaluated
with
internal
validation
by
bootstrapping
.

Results
:
In
step
1
,
predictors
for
A
(
H7N9
)
included
male
sex
,
poultry
exposure
history
,
and
fever
,
haemoptysis
,
or
shortness
of
breath
on
history
and
physical
examination
.

In
step
2
,
haziness
or
pneumonic
consolidation
on
chest
radiographs
and
leukopenia
were
also
associated
with
a
higher
probability
of
A
(
H7N9
)
.

The
observed
risk
of
A
(
H7N9
)
was
0.3
%
for
those
assigned
to
the
low-risk
group
and
2.5
%
,
4.3
%
,
and
44.0
%
for
tertiles
1
through
3
,
respectively
,
in
the
high-risk
group
.

This
prediction
rule
achieved
good
model
performance
,
with
an
optimism-corrected
sensitivity
of
0.93
,
a
specificity
of
0.80
,
and
an
area
under
the
receiver-operating
characteristic
curve
of
0.96
.

Conclusions
:
A
simple
decision
rule
based
on
data
readily
obtainable
in
the
setting
of
patients
'
first
clinical
presentations
from
the
first
wave
of
the
A/H7N9
epidemic
in
China
has
been
developed
.

This
prediction
rule
has
achieved
good
model
performance
in
predicting
their
risk
of
A
(
H7N9
)
infection
and
should
be
useful
in
guiding
important
clinical
and
public
health
decisions
in
a
timely
and
objective
manner
.

Data
to
be
gathered
with
its
use
in
the
current
evolving
second
wave
of
the
A/H7N9
epidemic
in
China
will
help
to
inform
its
performance
in
the
field
and
contribute
to
its
further
refinement
.

In
recent
years
there
has
been
growing
availability
of
individual-level
spatio-temporal
disease
data
,
particularly
due
to
the
use
of
modern
communicating
devices
with
GPS
tracking
functionality
.

These
detailed
data
have
been
proven
useful
for
inferring
disease
transmission
to
a
more
refined
level
than
previously
.

However
,
there
remains
a
lack
of
statistically
sound
frameworks
to
model
the
underlying
transmission
dynamic
in
a
mechanistic
manner
.

Such
a
development
is
particularly
crucial
for
enabling
a
general
epidemic
predictive
framework
at
the
individual
level
.

In
this
paper
we
propose
a
new
statistical
framework
for
mechanistically
modelling
individual-to-individual
disease
transmission
in
a
landscape
with
heterogeneous
population
density
.

Our
methodology
is
first
tested
using
simulated
datasets
,
validating
our
inferential
machinery
.

The
methodology
is
subsequently
applied
to
data
that
describes
a
regional
Ebola
outbreak
in
Western
Africa
(
2014
)
(
2015
)
.

Our
results
show
that
the
methods
are
able
to
obtain
estimates
of
key
epidemiological
parameters
that
are
broadly
consistent
with
the
literature
,
while
revealing
a
significantly
shorter
distance
of
transmission
.

More
importantly
,
in
contrast
to
existing
approaches
,
we
are
able
to
perform
a
more
general
model
prediction
that
takes
into
account
the
susceptible
population
.

Finally
,
our
results
show
that
,
given
reasonable
scenarios
,
the
framework
can
be
an
effective
surrogate
for
susceptible-explicit
individual
models
which
are
often
computationally
challenging
.

spatio-temporal

In
this

we
develop
a

that
overcomes
a

Influenza
A
virus
is
the
respiratory
pathogen
responsible
for
influenza
.

Infection
by
the
2009
pandemic
influenza
A
(
H1N1
)
virus
caused
severe
lower
airway
inflammation
and
pneumonia
.

Asthma
is
a
chronic
inflammatory
disorder
of
the
airways
that
affects
the
entire
brachial
tree
,
and
was
one
of
the
commonest
underlying
medical
conditions
among
patients
hospitalized
with
the
2009
pandemic
influenza
virus
infection
.

Although
respiratory
virus
infections
are
the
major
causes
of
asthma
exacerbation
,
the
mechanism
by
which
influenza
exacerbates
asthma
is
poorly
understood
.

Animal
models
of
disease
comorbidity
are
crucial
to
understanding
host-pathogen
interactions
and
elucidating
complex
pathologies
.

Existing
murine
models
of
influenza
virus
infection
in
asthmatics
show
that
asthmatic
mice
are
highly
resistant
to
influenza
virus
infection
,
which
contradicts
clinical
observations
in
humans
.

Here
,
we
developed
a
murine
model
of
influenza
virus/asthma
comorbidity
using
NC/Nga
mice
,
which
are
highly
sensitive
to
allergic
reactions
such
as
atopic
dermatitis
and
allergic
airway
inflammation
.

This
model
was
then
used
to
examine
the
impact
of
allergic
airway
inflammation
on
lung
pathology
in
the
2009
pandemic
influenza
virus
infected
mice
.

The
results
showed
that
induction
of
acute
allergic
airway
inflammation
in
pre-existing
influenza
virus
infection
had
additive
effects
on
exacerbation
of
lung
pathology
,
which
mirrors
findings
in
human
epidemiological
studies
.

In
contrast
,
pre-existing
allergic
airway
inflammation
protected
from
subsequent
influenza
virus
infection
,
which
was
compatible
with
those
of
previous
murine
models
of
influenza
virus
infection
in
asthmatic
mice
.

These
variable
outcomes
of
this
murine
model
indicate
that
the
temporal
relation
between
allergic
airway
inflammation
and
influenza
virus
infection
might
play
a
critical
role
in
asthma
and
influenza
comorbidity
.

Thus
,
this
murine
model
will
further
our
understanding
of
how
influenza
virus
infection
affects
an
asthmatic
host
and
may
aid
the
development
of
strategies
to
improve
treatments
and
outcomes
for
asthmatics
harboring
influenza
virus
infection

Globally
,
regions
at
the
highest
risk
for
emerging
infectious
diseases
are
often
the
ones
with
the
fewest
resources
.

As
a
result
,
implementing
sustainable
infectious
disease
surveillance
systems
in
these
regions
is
challenging
.

The
cost
of
these
programs
and
difficulties
associated
with
collecting
,
storing
and
transporting
relevant
samples
have
hindered
them
in
the
regions
where
they
are
most
needed
.

Therefore
,
we
tested
the
sensitivity
and
feasibility
of
a
novel
surveillance
technique
called
xenosurveillance
.

This
approach
utilizes
the
host
feeding
preferences
and
behaviors
of
Anopheles
gambiae
,
which
are
highly
anthropophilic
and
rest
indoors
after
feeding
,
to
sample
viruses
in
human
beings
.

We
hypothesized
that
mosquito
bloodmeals
could
be
used
to
detect
vertebrate
viral
pathogens
within
realistic
field
collection
timeframes

relevant

Frameshifting
is
induced
by
mRNA
secondary
structures
that
compromise
ribosome
fidelity
during
decoding
of
a
heptanucleotide
'slippery
'
sequence
.

The
nsp2
PRF
signal
of
porcine
reproductive
and
respiratory
syndrome
virus
is
distinctive
in
directing
both
−2
and
−1
PRF
and
in
its
requirement
for
a
trans-acting
protein
factor
,
the
viral
replicase
subunit
nsp1␤
.

Here
we
show
that
the
the
trans-activation
of
frameshifting
is
carried
out
by
a
protein
complex
composed
of
nsp1␤
and
a
cellular
poly
(
C
)
binding
protein
(
PCBP
)
.

From
the
results
of
in
vitro
translation
and
electrophoretic
mobility
shift
assays
,
we
demonstrate
that
a
PCBP/nsp1␤
complex
binds
to
a
C-rich
sequence
downstream
of
the
slippery
sequence
and
here
mimics
the
activity
of
a
structured
mRNA
stimulator
of
PRF
.

This
is
the
first
description
of
a
role
for
a
trans-acting
cellular
protein
in
PRF
.

The
discovery
broadens
the
repertoire
of
activities
associated
with
poly
(
C
)
binding
proteins
and
prototypes
a
new
class
of
virus-host
interactions
.

Background
:
Platelets
are
associated
with
HIV
in
the
blood
of
infected
individuals
and
might
modulate
viral
dissemination
,
particularly
if
the
virus
is
directly
transmitted
into
the
bloodstream
.

The
C-type
lectin
DC-SIGN
and
the
novel
HIV
attachment
factor
CLEC-2
are
expressed
by
platelets
and
facilitate
HIV
transmission
from
platelets
to
T-cells
.

Here
,
we
studied
the
molecular
mechanisms
behind
CLEC-2-mediated
HIV-1
transmission
.

Binding
studies
with
soluble
proteins
indicated
that
CLEC-2
,
in
contrast
to
DC-SIGN
,
does
not
recognize
the
viral
envelope
protein
,
but
a
cellular
factor
expressed
on
kidney-derived
293T
cells
.

Subsequent
analyses
revealed
that
the
cellular
mucin-like
membranous
glycoprotein
podoplanin
,
a
CLEC-2
ligand
,
was
expressed
on
293T
cells
and
incorporated
into
virions
released
from
these
cells
.

Knock-down
of
podoplanin
in
293T
cells
by
shRNA
showed
that
virion
incorporation
of
podoplanin
was
required
for
efficient
CLEC-2-dependent
HIV-1
interactions
with
cell
lines
and
platelets
.

Flow
cytometry
revealed
no
evidence
for
podoplanin
expression
on
viable
T-cells
and
peripheral
blood
mononuclear
cells
(
PBMC
)
.

Podoplanin
was
also
not
detected
on
HIV-1
infected
T-cells
.

However
,
apoptotic
bystander
cells
in
HIV-1
infected
cultures
reacted
with
anti-podoplanin
antibodies
,
and
similar
results
were
obtained
upon
induction
of
apoptosis
in
a
cell
line
and
in
PBMCs
suggesting
an
unexpected
link
between
apoptosis
and
podoplanin
expression
.

Despite
the
absence
of
detectable
podoplanin
expression
,
HIV-1
produced
in
PBMC
was
transmitted
to
Tcells
in
a
CLEC-2-dependent
manner
,
indicating
that
T-cells
might
express
an
as
yet
unidentified
CLEC-2
ligand
.

Conclusions
:
Virion
incorporation
of
podoplanin
mediates
CLEC-2
interactions
of
HIV-1
derived
from
293T
cells
,
while
incorporation
of
a
different
cellular
factor
seems
to
be
responsible
for
CLEC-2-dependent
capture
of
PBMC-derived
viruses
.

Furthermore
,
evidence
was
obtained
that
podoplanin
expression
is
connected
to
apoptosis
,
a
finding
that
deserves
further
investigation
.

Since
1997
,
G1-lineage
H9N2
avian
influenza
viruses
have
been
circulating
in
Asia
and
later
on
in
the
Middle
East
,
and
they
have
been
associated
to
mild
respiratory
disease
,
drops
in
egg
production
and
moderate
mortality
in
chickens
,
in
particular
in
the
presence
of
concurrent
infections
.

In
this
study
,
we
investigated
the
importance
of
the
G1-lineage
H9N2
A/chicken/Israel/1163/2011
virus
as
a
primary
pathogen
in
layers
,
analyzing
its
tropism
and
binding
affinity
for
the
oviduct
tissues
,
and
investigating
the
long-term
impact
on
egg
production
.

Besides
causing
a
mild
respiratory
infection
,
the
virus
replicated
in
the
oviduct
of
60
%
of
the
hens
causing
different
degrees
of
salpingitis
throughout
the
organ
,
in
particular
at
the
level
of
the
infundibulum
,
where
the
detection
of
the
virus
was
associated
with
severe
heterophilic
infiltrate
,
and
necrosis
of
the
epithelium
.

Binding
affinity
assays
confirmed
that
the
infundibulum
was
the
most
receptive
region
of
the
oviduct
.

The
drop
in
egg
production
was
at
its
peek
at
2
weeks
post-infection
(
pi
)
(
60
%
decrease
)
and
continued
up
to
80
days
pi
(
35
%
decrease
)
.

On
day
80
pi
,
non-laying
birds
showed
egg
yolk
peritonitis
,
and
histopathological
analyses
described
profound
alteration
of
the
infundibulum
architecture
,
duct
ectasia
and
thinning
of
the
epithelium
,
while
the
rest
of
the
oviduct
and
ovary
appeared
normal
.

Our
results
show
that
this
H9N2
virus
is
a
primary
pathogen
in
layer
hens
,
and
that
its
replication
in
the
infundibulum
is
responsible
for
acute
and
chronic
lesions
that
limits
the
effective
functionality
of
the
oviduct

compromising
the

Previous

have
identified
interferon-induced
transmembrane

(
IFITMs
)
as
an
interferon-stimulated
gene
family
.

However
,
the
role
of
IFITMs
in
HTNV
infection
is
unclear
.

In
this
study
,
we
observed
that

polymorphisms

associated
with
the

severity
and

load
in
the
plasma
of
HFRS
patients
.

In

experiments
showed
that
the
truncated
protein
produced
by
the
rs12252
C
allele
exhibited
an
impaired
anti-HTNV
activity

We
also
proved
that
IFITM3
was
able
to
inhibit
HTNV
infection
in
both
HUVEC
and
A549
cells
by
overexpression
and
RNAi
assays
,
likely
via
a
mechanism
of
inhibiting
virus
entry
demonstrated
by
binding
and
entry
assay
.

Localization
of
IFITM3
in
late
endosomes
was
also
observed
.

In
addition
,
we
demonstrated
that
the
transcription
of
IFITM3
is
negatively
regulated
by
an
lncRNA
negative
regulator
of
interferon
response
(
NRIR
)
.

Taken
together
,
we
conclude
that
IFITM3
,
negatively
regulated
by
NRIR
,
inhibits
HTNV
infection
,
and
its
SNP
rs12252
correlates
with
the
plasma
HTNV
load
and
the
disease
severity
of
patients
with
HFRS

Mink
enteritis
virus
(
MEV
)
is
one
of
the
most
important
pathogens
in
the
mink
industry
.

Recent
studies
have
shed
light
into
the
role
of
microRNAs
(
miRNAs
)
,
small
noncoding
RNAs
of
length
ranging
from
18-23
nucleotides
(
nt
)
,
as
critical
modulators
in
the
host-pathogen
interaction
networks
.

We
previously
showed
that
miRNA
miR-181b
can
inhibit
MEV
replication
by
repression
of
viral
non-structural
protein
1
expression
.

Here
,
we
report
that
two
other
miRNAs
(
miR-320a
and
miR-140
)
inhibit
MEV
entry
into
feline
kidney
(
F81
)
cells
by
downregulating
its
receptor
,
transferrin
receptor
(
TfR
)
,
by
targeting
the
3′
untranslated
region
(
UTR
)
of
TfR
mRNA
,
while
being
themselves
upregulated
.

Animals
2016
,
6
,
45
2
of
18
to
CO
2
also
displayed
behaviors
consistent
with
increased
anxiety
in
the
behavioral
testing
that
followed
the
exposure
.

Next
,
this
study
assessed
the
behavioral
and
physiologic
responses
of
rats
that
were
euthanized
with
100
%
CO
2
infused
at
10
%
,
30
%
,
or
100
%
volume
per
minute
displacement
rates
.

Analysis
of
the
concentrations
of
CO
2
and
oxygen
in
the
euthanasia
chamber
and
the
behavioral
responses
of
the
rats
suggest
that
the
use
of
the
very
low
flow
volume
per
minute
displacement
rate
(
10
%
)
may
prolong
the
duration
of
panicogenic
ranges
of
ambient
CO
2
,
while
the
use
of
the
higher
flow
volume
per
minute
displacement
rate
(
100
%
)
increases
agitation
.

Therefore
,
of
the
volume
displacement
per
minute
rates
evaluated
,
this
study
suggests
that
30
%
minimizes
the
potential
pain
and
distress
experienced
by
the
animal
.

Background
:
Infectious
bronchitis
virus
(
IBV
)
,
a
prototype
of
the
Coronaviridae
family
,
is
an
economically
important
causative
agent
of
infectious
bronchitis
in
chickens
and
causes
an
acute
and
highly
contagious
upper
respiratory
tract
infections
that
may
lead
to
nephritis
.

However
,
the
molecular
antiviral
mechanisms
of
chickens
to
IBV
infection
remain
poorly
understood
.

In
this
study
,
we
conducted
global
gene
expression
profiling
of
chicken
kidney
tissue
after
nephropathogenic
IBV
infection
to
better
understand
the
interactions
between
host
and
virus
.

Results
:
IBV
infection
contributed
to
differential
expression
of
1777
genes
,
of
which
876
were
up-regulated
and
901
down-regulated
in
the
kidney
compared
to
those
of
control
chickens
and
103
associated
with
immune
and
inflammatory
responses
may
play
important
roles
in
the
host
defense
response
during
IBV
infection
.

Twelve
of
the
altered
immune-related
genes
were
confirmed
by
real-time
RT-PCR
.

Gene
ontology
category
,
KEGG
pathway
,
and
gene
interaction
networks
(
STRING
analysis
)
were
analyzed
to
identify
relationships
among
differentially
expressed
genes
involved
in
signal
transduction
,
cell
adhesion
,
immune
responses
,
apoptosis
regulation
,
positive
regulation
of
the
I-kappaB
kinase/NF-kappaB
cascade
and
response
to
cytokine
stimulus
.

Most
of
these
genes
were
related
and
formed
a
large
network
,
in
which
IL6
,
STAT1
,
MYD88
,
IRF1
and
NFKB2
were
key
genes
.

Our
results
provided
comprehensive
knowledge
regarding
the
host
transcriptional
response
to
IBV
infection
in
chicken
kidney
tissues
,
thereby
providing
insight
into
IBV
pathogenesis
,
particularly
the
involvement
of
innate
immune
pathway
genes
associated
with
IBV
infection
.

Infectious
bronchitis
virus
(
IBV
)
variants
constantly
emerge
and
pose
economic
threats
to
poultry
farms
worldwide
.

Numerous
studies
on
the
molecular
and
pathogenic
characterization
of
IBV
variants
have
been
performed
between
2007
and
2017
,
which
we
have
reviewed
herein
.

We
noted
that
viral
genetic
mutations
and
recombination
events
commonly
gave
rise
to
distinct
IBV
genotypes
,
serotypes
and
pathotypes
.

In
addition
to
characterizing
the
S1
genes
,
full
viral
genomic
sequencing
,
comprehensive
antigenicity
,
and
pathogenicity
studies
on
emerging
variants
have
advanced
our
understanding
of
IBV
infections
,
which
is
valuable
for
developing
countermeasures
against
IBV
field
outbreaks
.

This
review
of
IBV
variants
provides
practical
value
for
understanding
their
phylogenetic
relationships
and
epidemiology
from
both
regional

Dromedary
camels
have
been
shown
to
be
the
main
reservoir
for
human
Middle
East
respiratory
syndrome
(
MERS
)
infections
.

This
systematic
review
aims
to
compile
and
analyse
all
published
data
on
MERS-coronavirus
(
CoV
)
in
the
global
camel
population
to
provide
an
overview
of
current
knowledge
on
the
distribution
,
spread
and
risk
factors
of
infections
in
dromedary
camels
.

We
included
original
research
articles
containing
laboratory
evidence
of
MERS-CoV
infections
in
dromedary
camels
in
the
field
from
2013
to
April
2018
.

In
general
,
camels
only
show
minor
clinical
signs
of
disease
after
being
infected
with
MERS-CoV
.

Serological
evidence
of
MERS-CoV
in
camels
has
been
found
in
20
countries
,
with
molecular
evidence
for
virus
circulation
in
13
countries
.

The
seroprevalence
of
MERS-CoV
antibodies
increases
with
age
in
camels
,
while
the
prevalence
of
viral
shedding
as
determined
by
MERS-CoV
RNA
detection
in
nasal
swabs
decreases
.

In
several
studies
,
camels
that
were
sampled
at
animal
markets
or
quarantine
facilities
were
seropositive
more
often
than
camels
at
farms
as
well
as
imported
camels
vs.
locally
bred
camels
.

Some
studies
show
a
relatively
higher
seroprevalence
and
viral
detection
during
the
cooler
winter
months
.

Knowledge
of
the
animal
reservoir
of
MERS-CoV
is
essential
to
develop
intervention
and
control
measures
to
prevent
human
infections
.

Equine
lentivirus
receptor
1
(
ELR1
)
has
been
identified
as
the
sole
receptor
for
equine
infectious
anemia
virus
(
EIAV
)
and
is
a
member
of
the
tumor
necrosis
factor
receptor
(
TNFR
)
superfamily
.

In
addition
to
the
previously
described
membraneassociated
form
of
ELR1
,
two
other
major
alternative
splicing
variant
mRNAs
were
identified
in
equine
monocyte-derived
macrophages
(
eMDMs
)
.

One
major
spliced
species
(
ELR1-IN
)
contained
an
insertion
of
153
nt
,
which
resulted
in
a
premature
stop
codon
situated
561
nt
upstream
of
the
predicted
membrane
spanning
domain
.

The
other
major
species
(
ELR1-DE
)
has
a
deletion
of
109
nt
that
causes
a
shift
of
the
open
reading
frame
and
generates
a
stop
codon
312
nt
downstream
.

Because
ELR1-DE
presumably
encodes
a
peptide
of
a
mere
23
residues
,
only
ELR1-IN
was
further
analyzed
.

The
expression
of
a
soluble
form
of
ELR1
(
sELR1
)
by
ELR1-IN
was
confirmed
by
Western
blot
and
immunofluorescence
analyses
.

Similar
to
ELR1
,
the
transcription
level
of
ELR1-IN
varied
among
individual
horses
and
at
different
time
points
in
the
same
individuals
.

The
ratio
of
ELR1-IN
mRNA
species
to
ELR1
mRNA
was
approximately
1:2.5
.

Pre-incubation
of
the
recombinant
sELR1
with
EIAV
significantly
inhibited
EIAV
infection
in
equine
macrophages
,
the
primary
in
vivo
target
cell
of
the
virus
.

Fetal
equine
dermal
(
FED
)
cells
are
susceptible
to
EIAV
in
vitro
,
and
the
replication
of
EIAV
in
FED
cells
transiently
transfected
with
ELR1-IN
was
markedly
reduced
when
compared
with
replication
in
cells
transfected
with
the
empty
vector
.

Finally
,
the
expression
levels
of
both
forms
of
the
EIAV
receptor
were
significantly
regulated
by
infection
with
this
virus
.

Taken
together
,
our
data
indicate
that
sELR1
acts
as
a
secreted
cellular
factor
that
inhibits
EIAV
infection
in
host
cells
.

Virological
tests
have
now
shown
conclusively
that
a
novel
coronavirus
is
causing
the
2019-2020
atypical
pneumonia
outbreak
in
Wuhan
,
China
.

We
demonstrate
that
non-virological
descriptive
characteristics
could
have
determined
that
the
outbreak
is
caused
by
a
novel
pathogen
in
advance
of
virological
testing
.

Characteristics
of
the
ongoing
outbreak
were
collected
in
real
time
from
two
medical
social
media
sites
.

These
were
compared
against
characteristics
of
eleven
pathogens
that
have
previously
caused
cases
of
atypical
pneumonia
.

The
probability
that
the
current
outbreak
is
due
to
``
Disease
X
''
(
i.e.
,
previously
unknown
etiology
)
as
opposed
to
one
of
the
known
pathogens
was
inferred
,
and
this
estimate
was
updated
as
the
outbreak
continued
.

The
probability
(
expressed
as
a
percentage
)
that
Disease
X
is
driving
the
outbreak
was
assessed
as
over
29
%
on
31
December
2019
,
one
week
before
virus
identification
.

After
some
specific
pathogens
were
ruled
out
by
laboratory
tests
on
5
January
2020
,
the
inferred
probability
of
Disease
X
was
over
49
%
.

We
showed
quantitatively
that
the
emerging
outbreak
of
atypical
pneumonia
cases
is
consistent
with
causation
by
a
novel
pathogen
.

The
proposed
approach
,
which
uses
only
routinely
observed
non-virological
data
,
can
aid
ongoing
risk
assessments
in
advance
of
virological
test
results
becoming
available
.

Astroviruses
(
AstVs
)
are
responsible
for
infection
of
a
large
diversity
of
mammalian
and
avian
species
,
including
bats
,
aquatic
birds
,
livestock
and
humans
.

We
investigated
AstVs
circulation
in
bats
in
Mozambique
and
Mayotte
,
a
small
island
in
the
Comoros
Archipelago
located
between
east
Africa
and
Madagascar
.

Biological
material
was
collected
from
338
bats
and
tested
for
the
presence
of
the
AstV
RNA-dependent
RNA-polymerase
gene
with
a
pan-AstV
semi-nested
polymerase
chain
reaction
assay
.

None
of
the
79
samples
obtained
from
Mayotte
bats
(
Pteropus
seychellensis
comorensis
and
Chaerephon
pusillus
)
tested
positive
;
however
,
20.1
%
of
bats
sampled
in
Mozambique
shed
AstVs
at
the
time
of
sampling
and
significant
interspecific
variation
in
the
proportion
of
positive
bats
was
detected
.

Many
AstVs
sequences
obtained
from
a
given
bat
species
clustered
in
different
phylogenetic
lineages
,
while
others
seem
to
reflect
some
level
of
host-virus
association
,
but
also
with
AstVs
previously
reported
from
Malagasy
bats
.

Our
findings
support
active
circulation
of
a
large
diversity
of
AstVs
in
bats
in
the
western
Indian
Ocean
islands
,
including
the
southeastern
African
coast
,
and
highlight
the
need
for
more
detailed
assessment
of
its
risk
of
zoonotic
transmission
to
human
populations
.

Background
:
The
isolation
of
human
monoclonal
antibodies
(
mAbs
)
that
neutralize
a
broad
spectrum
of
primary
HIV-1
isolates
and
the
characterization
of
the
human
neutralizing
antibody
B
cell
response
to
HIV-1
infection
are
important
goals
that
are
central
to
the
design
of
an
effective
antibody-based
vaccine
.

Methods
and
Findings
:
We
immortalized
IgG
+
memory
B
cells
from
individuals
infected
with
diverse
clades
of
HIV-1
and
selected
on
the
basis
of
plasma
neutralization
profiles
that
were
cross-clade
and
relatively
potent
.

Culture
supernatants
were
screened
using
various
recombinant
forms
of
the
envelope
glycoproteins
(
Env
)
in
multiple
parallel
assays
.

We
isolated
58
mAbs
that
were
mapped
to
different
Env
surfaces
,
most
of
which
showed
neutralizing
activity
.

One
mAb
in
particular
(
HJ16
)
specific
for
a
novel
epitope
proximal
to
the
CD4
binding
site
on
gp120
selectively
neutralized
a
multi-clade
panel
of
Tier-2
HIV-1
pseudoviruses
,
and
demonstrated
reactivity
that
was
comparable
in
breadth
,
but
distinct
in
neutralization
specificity
,
to
that
of
the
other
CD4
binding
site-specific
neutralizing
mAb
b12
.

A
second
mAb
(
HGN194
)
bound
a
conserved
epitope
in
the
V3
crown
and

A
third
mAb
(
HK20
)
with
broad
neutralizing
activity
,
particularly
as
a
Fab
fragment
,
recognized
a
highly
conserved
epitope
in
the
HR-1
region
of
gp41
,
but
showed
striking
assay-dependent
selectivity
in
its
activity
.

Conclusions
:
This
study
reveals
that
by
using
appropriate
screening
methods
,
a
large
proportion
of
memory
B
cells
can
be
isolated
that
produce
mAbs
with
HIV-1
neutralizing
activity
.

Three
of
these
mAbs
show
unusual
breadth
of
neutralization
and
therefore
add
to
the
current
panel
of
HIV-1
neutralizing
antibodies
with
potential
for
passive
protection
and

Background
:
Bioaerosol
sampling
devices
are
necessary
for
the
characterization
of
infectious
bioaerosols
emitted
by
naturally-infected
hosts
with
acute
respiratory
virus
infections
.

Assessment
of
these
devices
under
multiple
experimental
conditions
will
provide
insight
for
device
use
.

The
primary
objective
of
this
study
was
to
assess
and
compare
bioaerosol
sampling
devices
using
a
)
an
in

,
environmentally-controlled
artificial
bioaerosol
system
at
a
range
of
different

and
b
)
an
in
vivo
bioaerosol
system
of
influenza
virus-infected
ferrets
under
controlled
environmental
conditions
.

Secondarily
,
we
also
sought
to
examine
the
impact
of
NSAIDs
on
bioaerosol
emission
in
influenza
virus-infected
ferrets
to
address
its
potential
as
a
determinant
of
bioaerosol
emission
.

We
examined
the
performance
of
low
and
moderate
volume
bioaerosol
samplers
for
the
collection
of
viral
RNA
and
infectious
influenza
virus
in
vitro
and
in
vivo
using
artificial
bioaerosols
and
the
ferret
model
of
influenza
virus
infection
.

The
following
samplers
were
tested
:
the
polytetrafluoroethylene
filter
(
PTFE
filter
)
,
the
2stage
National
Institute
of
Occupational
Safety

)
and
the
6-stage
viable
Andersen
impactor
(
Andersen

)
.

The
PTFE
filter
and
NIOSH
cyclone
sampler
collected
similar
amounts
of
viral
RNA
and
infectious
virus
from
artificially-generated
aerosols
under
a
range
of
relative
humidities
(

)
.

Using
the
ferret
model
,
the
PTFE
filter
,
NIOSH
cyclone

the
functional
role
of
MIF
in
different
pathological
conditions
,
the
information
obtained
from
these
models
is
biased
towards
a
specific
species
.

In
experimental
science
,
results
obtained
from
multiple
clinically
relevant
animal
models
always
provide
convincing
data
that
might
recapitulate
in
humans
.

Syrian
golden
hamster
(
Mesocricetus
auratus
)
,
is
a
clinically
relevant
animal
model
for
multiple
human
diseases
.

Hence
,
the
major
objectives
of
this
study
were
to
characterize
the
structure
and
function
of
Mesocricetus
auratus
MIF
(
MaMIF
)
and
finally
evaluate
its
effect
on
pancreatic
tumor
growth
in
vivo
.

Initially
,
the
recombinant
MaMIF
was
cloned
,
expressed
and
purified
in
a
bacterial
expression
system
.

The
MaMIF
primary
sequence
,
biochemical
properties
,
and
crystal
structure
analysis
showed
greater
similarity
with
human
MIF
.

The
crystal
structure
of
MaMIF
illustrates
that
it
forms
a
homotrimer
as
known
in
human
and
mouse
.

However
,
MaMIF
exhibits
some
minor
structural
variations
when
compared
to
human
and
mouse
MIF
.

The
in
vitro
functional
studies
show
that
MaMif
has
tautomerase
activity
and
enhances
activation
and
migration
of
hamster
peripheral
blood
mononuclear
cells
(
PBMCs
)
.

Interestingly
,
injection
of
MaMIF
into
HapT1
pancreatic
tumor-bearing
hamsters
significantly
enhanced
the
tumor
growth
and
tumor-associated
angiogenesis
.

Together
,
the
current
study
shows
a
structural
and
functional
similarity
between
the
hamster
and
human
MIF
.

Moreover
,
it
has
demonstrated
that
a
high
level
of
circulating
MIF
originating
from
non-tumor
cells
might
also
promote
pancreatic
tumor
growth
in
vivo
.

Clinically
relevant
animal
models
help
in
understanding
the
pathogenesis
of
different
human
and
animal
diseases
and
play
crucial
roles
in
developing
new
therapeutics
against
them
1
.

In
spite
of
the
dominance
of
the
mouse
as
an
experimental
model
animal
,
the
hamster
has
carved
its
niche
as
a
potential
model
animal
for
studying
many
diseases
and
for
the
evaluation
of
therapeutic
agents
.

Hamsters
are
frequently
used
in
various
disease
pathogenesis
studies
due
to
the
ease
of
handling
them
and
the
similarity
to
humans
in
disease
development
.

Hamsters
are
important
animal
models
for
studying
various
infectious
diseases
of
humans
2-9
.

The
hamster
models
of
pancreatic
and
oral
cancer
have
gained
importance
in
their
respective
fields
10-15
.

Moreover
,
these
animals
have
also
been
instrumental
in
studying
metabolic
and/or
inflammatory
diseases
like
diabetes
and
pancreatitis
16
,
17
.

Despite
the
fact
that
the
hamster
is
an
important
clinically
relevant
animal
model
for
different
diseases
,
it
is
not
used
to
its
full
potential
.

In
this
aspect
,
the
non-availability
of
complete
genetic
information
of
these
animals
and
lack
of
biological
reagents
like
recombinant
proteins
and
antibodies
related
to
them
are
the
major
constraints
.

Macrophage
migration
inhibitory
factor
(
MIF
)
is
a
pro-inflammatory
cytokine
with
pleiotropic
functions
in
various
pathophysiological
processes
18-21
.

Though
initially
identified
as
a
T
cell-derived
cytokine
that
inhibits
macrophage
migration
,
its
pleiotropic
effects
on
immune
cells
,
cancer
cells
,
as
well
as
non-cancerous
cells
made
MIF
more
enigmatic
to
the
researchers
.

Involvement
of
MIF
in
several
human
diseases
like
pulmonary
hypertension
,
endothelial
cell
growth
,
atherosclerosis
,
wound
healing
,
viral
infection
,
many
cancers
including
lung
,
colon
,
prostate
,
breast
and
pancreatic
cancer
has
gained
significant
interest
in
this
molecule
22
.

In
one
of
our
earlier
published
study
,
we
have
characterized
HapT1
cell
line-based
Syrian
golden
hamster
tumor
as
a
model
of
pancreatic
cancer-associated
desmoplasia
,
an
event
that
plays
a
key
role
in
human
pancreatic
cancer
progression
.

In
that
study
,
for
the
first
time
,
proteomics
analysis
of
whole-cell
lysate
from
hamster
pancreatic
stellate
cells
(
PSCs
)
showed
expression
of
macrophage
migration
inhibitory
factor
(
MIF
)
by
the
cells
11
.

At
that
particular
time
,
due
to
the
unavailability
of
information
and
reagents
for
Mesocricetus
auratus
MIF
(
MaMIF
)
,
we
were
unable
to
investigate
the
function
of
this
molecule
in
the
hamster
model
of
pancreatic
cancer
.

Hence
,
in
the
current
study
,
our
major
objective
was
to
characterize
the
MaMIF
protein
and
evaluate
the
effect
of
exogenous
MIF
on
the
growth
of
pancreatic
tumor
in
a
syngeneic
model
of
hamster
pancreatic
cancer
.

In
the
current
study
,
we
have
successfully
purified
recombinant
MaMIF
protein
from
a
bacterial
protein
expression
system
.

Our
analysis
showed
that
like
human
MIF
,
MaMIF
also
forms
a
trimer
in
solution
.

A
commercially
available
MIF
antibody
raised
against
human
MIF
cross-reacts
with
MaMIF
.

We
resolved
the
trimeric
MaMIF
crystal
structure
at
1.8
Å
resolution
,
and
the
structural
analysis
showed
multiple
features
in
MaMIF
to
be
similar
to
mouse
and
human
MIF
.

Further
,
biochemical
and
cell
culture-based
studies
using
endotoxin-free
MaMIF
showed
it
's
enzymatic
(
tautomerase
)
and
immunostimulatory
activities
,
which
suggest
that
the
purified
protein
is
biologically
active
.

Importantly
,
all
the
biological
properties
of
MaMIF
investigated
in
this
study
were
similar
to
human
MIF
.

At
the
end
,
we
have
investigated
the
effect
of
MaMIF
on
the
growth
of
HapT1
pancreatic
tumor
in
its
syngeneic
host
.

The
data
clearly
shows
the
pro-tumorigenic
effect
of
MaMIF
on
the
HapT1
pancreatic
tumor
.

Taken
together
,
the
data
presented
in
this
study
have
unraveled
multiple
information
regarding
MaMIF
,
and
indicate
the
importance
of
hamster
as
a
model
to
investigate
questions
related
to
the
role
of
MIF
in
pancreatic
cancer
progression

and
stained
with

.

Next
,
the
E.

recombinant
MaMIF
used
in
our
biochemical
experiments
was
used
to
perform

to
elucidate
the

of
MIF
polyclonal
antibody
(

used
to

The
purpose
of
the
current
study
was
to
examine
the
ocular
pathogenesis
and
immune
reaction
in
mice
after
intravitreal
dispase
injection
.

Methods
:
Three
microliters
of
dispase
at
a
concentration
of
0.2
U/μl
were
injected
into
the
vitreal
cavities
of
4-6-weekold
mice
.

Hematoxylin
and
eosin
staining
,
immunofluorescence
analysis
,
and
electroretinograms
of
the
eyes
were
then
performed
to
assess
ocular
changes
,
and
enzyme-linked
immunospot
assays
and
intracellular
staining
of
single-cell
suspensions
of
the
spleens
were
used
to
detect
immune
changes
during
an
8
week
observation
period
.

Results
:
Neutrophils
were
the
main
inflammatory
infiltrating
cells
appearing
at
the
anterior
chamber
.

No
cluster
of

)
3+
labeled
T
cells
,
F4/80+
labeled
macrophages
,
or
CD56+
labeled
natural
killer
cells
were
found
in
the
vitreal
cavities
or
retinas
in
dispase-injected
mice
within
5
days
after
injection
.

Proliferative
vitreoretinopathy
(
PVR
)
like
signs
first
appeared
at
2
weeks
,
gradually
increased
thereafter
,
and
reached
peak
values
at
8
weeks
.

There
was
a
statistically
significant
difference
in
b-wave
amplitudes
between
the
PVR
and
saline-control
eyes
.

Enzyme-linked
immunospot
assays
and
intracellular
staining
showed
that
specific
CD4+
and
CD8+
labeled
T
cells
were
not
involved
in
dispase-injected
mice
.

Conclusions
:
Our
data
show
that
neutrophils
in
the
anterior
chamber
and
PVR-like
signs
in
the
retinas
were
found
,
and
that
specific
immune
reactions
were
not
involved
after
intravitreal
dispase
injection
in
mice
.

We
introduce
a
method
for
estimating
incidence
curves
of
several
co-circulating
infectious
pathogens
,
where
each
infection
has
its
own
probabilities
of
particular
symptom
profiles
.

Our
deconvolution
method
utilizes
weekly
surveillance
data
on
symptoms
from
a
defined
population
as
well
as
additional
data
on
symptoms
from
a
sample
of
virologically
confirmed
infectious
episodes
.

We
illustrate
this
method
by
numerical
simulations
and
by
using
data
from
a
survey
conducted
on
the
University
of
Michigan
campus

Last
,
we
describe
the
data
needs
to
make
such
estimates

.

The
objective
of
this

was
to
investigate
the

Overall
,
959

The

of
research
publications
in
social

in
the
field
of

showed
a
steady
upward

of
the
total

of
the

.

A

showed
that
personality

were
continual

Conclusions
:
This

reporting
the
global
trends
in
the
research

,
publication
characteristics
such
as
quality
and

.

The
USA
and
its

play
a

Infectious
laryngotracheitis
(
ILT
)
is
an
acute
respiratory
disease
of
poultry
caused
by
infectious
laryngotracheitis
virus
(
ILTV
)
.

Control
of
the
disease
with
live
attenuated
vaccines
administered
via
eye
drop
build
upon
immune
responses
generated
by
the
eye-associated
lymphoid
tissues
.

The
aim
of
this
study
was
to
assess
cytokine
and
lymphocyte
changes
in
the
conjunctiva-associated
lymphoid
tissues
(
CALT
)
and
Harderian
gland
(
HG
)
stimulated
by
the
ocular
inoculation
of
the
ILTV
chicken
embryo
origin
(
CEO
)
vaccine
strain
and
virulent
strain
63140
.

This
study
offers
strong
evidence
to
support
the
roles
that
the
CALT
and
HG
play
in
the
development
of
protective
ILTV
immune
responses
.

It
supports
the
premise
that
ILTV-mediated
immunomodulation
favors
the
B
cell
response
over
those
of
T
cells
.

Further
,
it
provides
evidence
that
expansions
of
CD8α
+
cells
,
with
the
concomitant
expression
of
the
Granzyme
A
gene
,
are
key
to
reducing
viral
genomes
in
the
CALT
and
halting
ILTV
cytolytic
replication
in
the
conjunctiva
.

Ultimately
,
this
study
revealed
that
the
early
upregulation
of
interleukin
(
IL
)
-12p40
and
Interferon
(
IFN
)
-γ
cytokine
genes
,
which
shape
the
antigen-specific
cell-mediated
immune
responses
,
retarded
the
decline
of
virus
replication
,
and
enhanced
the
development
of
lesions
in
the
conjunctiva
epithelium
.

Intervention
strategies
to
control
the
disease
rely
on
the
implementation
of
biosecurity
measures
and
vaccination
with
live-attenuated
and/or
recombinant
viral
vector
vaccines
expressing
ILTV
proteins
[
1
]
.

Among
live-attenuated
vaccines
,
there
are
two
main
types
:
the
tissue
culture
origin
(
TCO
)
vaccine
[
2
]
and
chicken
embryo
origin
(
CEO
)
vaccines
[
3
]
.

Both
,
CEO
and
TCO
vaccines
can
be
administered
through
the
ocular
,
oral
or
intranasal
mucosal
routes
to
elicit
local
and
systemic
immunity
[
4
,
5
]
,
are
capable
of
protecting
chickens
against
clinical
signs
and
mortality
,
and
suppress
replication
of
the
challenge
virus
[
6
]
.

However
,
it
has
been
demonstrated
that
live
attenuated
vaccine
strains
,
most
commonly
the
CEO
vaccine
strains
,
can
revert
to
virulence
if
allowed
to
circulate
in
naïve
chickens
and
give
rise
to
outbreak
viruses
,
such
as
the
virulent
strain
63140
[
1
]
.

Although
live
attenuated
vaccines
are
routinely
used
in
the
field
,
there
is
little
definitive
knowledge
about
the
molecular
and
cellular
immune
response
associated
with
ocular
vaccine-induced
protection
.

Early
seminal
studies
demonstrated
a
critical
role
for
the
cell-mediated
arm
of
the
immune
system
in
ILTV
protection
.

In
particular
,
it
appears
that
specific
T
cell
subsets
play
a
role
in
vaccine
protection
and
resistance
against
the
disease
[
7-9
]
.

More
recent
studies
suggest
that
the
local
inflammatory
processes
contribute
to
the
pathology
of
the
disease
,
and
eventually
modulate
the
responses
of
the
adaptive
immune
system
to
facilitate
viral
replication
[
10
]
.

Furthermore
,
ILTV
infection
appears
to
down-regulate
type
I
interferon
transcription
and
delays
the
early
transcription
of
inflammatory
genes
to
favor
initial
virus
replication
in
the
trachea
[
11
,
12
]
.

Unlike
the
mammalian
immune
system
,
the
avian
immune
system
lacks
a
discrete
lymphatic
network
.

Lymph
nodes
in
mammals
are
the
principal
sites
for
initial
antigen
presentation
in
mounting
naive
responses
.

In
contrast
,
chickens
have
a
distributed
immune
network
featuring
clusters
of
mucosal-associated
lymphoid
tissues
(
MALTs
)
that
appear
to
fill
the
role
of
organizing
naïve
responses
[
13
]
.

The
head-associated
lymphoid
tissue
(
HALT
)
is
comprised
of
the
nasal-associated
lymphoid
tissue
(
NALT
)
,
the
eye-associated
lymphoid
tissues
organized
in
the
conjunctiva-associated
lymphoid
tissue
(
CALT
)
and
the
Harderian
gland
(
HG
)
.

Despite
the
absence
of
a
direct
anatomic
connection
to
the
respiratory
system
,
the
HG
,
CALT
,
and
NALT
serve
as
major
contributors
of
immunity
for
the
upper
respiratory
airways
.

For
example
,
in
the
NALT
,
cells
capable
of
taking
up
Newcastle
disease
virus
(
NDV
)
-coated
beads
following
intranasal
administration
were
identified
as
potential
antigen
presenting
cells
(
APCs
)
[
14
]
.

In
the
HG
,
the
number
of
IgA-and
IgY-producing
cells
increased
after
the
ocular
inoculation
of
an
adenovirus
5
vector
expressing
the
avian
influenza
H5
protein
[
15
]
,
and
T
effector
cells
(
CD3
+
,
CD44
+
)
were
detected
in
the
HG
and
the
CALT
after
infectious
bronchitis
virus
(
IBV
)
ocular
inoculation
[
16
]
.

Currently
,
little
is
known
about
the
components
of
the
cell-mediated
immune
responses
associated
with
resistance
against
ILT
that
develops
within
the
eye-associated
lymphoid
tissues
.

Recent
findings
indicate
that
the
mucosal
route
of
viral
entry-ocular
,
oral
,
or
nasal-can
greatly
influence
the
levels
of
ILTV
lytic
replication
and
lymphocyte
infiltration
in
the
trachea
and
conjunctiva
[
17
]
.

Therefore
,
assessing
the
changes
in
immune
cell
populations
within
the
eye-associated
lymphoid
tissues
(
CALT
and
HG
)
after
ILTV
exposure
may
help
identify
important
features
occurring
in
mucosal
tissues
that
are
involved
in
ILTV
pathogenesis
and
host
immune
responses
.

To
this
end
,
the
objective
of
the
present
study
was
to
assess
differences
in
immune
cell
dynamics
by
monitoring
the
number
of
T
and
B
lymphocytes
,
the
number
of
MHC
class
I
and
MHC
class
II
antigen
surface
expressing

,
and
transcript
profile
of
interleukin
(

-12p40
,

-γ
,
and
Granzyme
A
genes
in
CALT
and
HG
after
ocular
inoculation
with
the
CEO
vaccine
strain
or
the
virulent
strain
63140
.

Collectively
,
this
study
highlights
the
important
role
of
the
eye-associated
lymphoid
tissue
and
the
immunity
elicited
against
ILTV
infection
.

It
provides
evidence
that
the
CALT
and
HG
play
different
roles
in
the
development
of
ILTV
immune
responses
which
were
greatly
influenced
by
the
viral
strain

Introduction
:
Allergic
reaction
to
dust
mites
is
a
relatively
common
condition
among
children
,
triggering
cutaneous
and
respiratory
responses
that
have
a
great
impact
on
the
health
of
this
population
.

Anaphylactic
hypersensitivity
is
characterized
by
an
exacerbated
response
involving
the
production
of
regulatory
cytokines
responsible
for
stimulating
the
production
of
IgE
antibodies
.

Objective
:
To
investigate
an
association
of
variants
in
cytokine
genes
(
IL1A
2889
,
IL1B
)
between
patients
sensitive
to
dust
mites
and
a
control
group
.

Methods
:
A
total
of
254
patients
were
grouped
as
atopic
and
non-atopic
according
to
sensitivity
as
evaluated
by
the
Prick
Test
and
to
cytokine
genotyping
by
the
polymerase
chain
reaction-sequence
specific
primers
(
PCR-SSP
)
method
using
the
Cytokine
Genotyping
Kit
.

Blomia
tropicalis
and
a
non-atopic
control
group
showed
significant
differences
between
allele
and
genotype
frequencies
in
the
regulatory
regions
of
cytokine
genes
,
with
important
evidence
for
IL4

in
T/C

.

Other
associations
were
observed
in
the
pro-inflammatory
cytokines
IL1A

Conclusion
:
Our
results
suggest
a
possible
association
between
single
nucleotide
polymorphisms
(
SNPs
)
in
cytokine
genes
and
hypersensitivity
to
dust

.

Vaccinia
virus
(
VACV
)
is
a
large
,
cytoplasmic
,
double-stranded
DNA
virus
that
requires
complex
interactions
with
host
proteins
in
order
to
replicate
.

To
explore
these
interactions
a
functional
high
throughput
small
interfering
RNA
(
siRNA
)
screen
targeting
6719
druggable
cellular
genes
was
undertaken
to
identify
host
factors
(
HF
)
influencing
the
replication
and
spread
of
an
eGFP-tagged
VACV
.

The
experimental
design
incorporated
a
low
multiplicity
of
infection
,
thereby
enhancing
detection
of
cellular
proteins
involved
in
cell-to-cell
spread
of
VACV
.

The
screen
revealed
153
pro-and
149
anti-viral
HFs
that
strongly
influenced
VACV
replication
.

These
HFs
were
investigated
further
by
comparisons
with
transcriptional
profiling
data
sets
and
HFs
identified
in
RNAi
screens
of
other
viruses
.

In
addition
,
functional
and
pathway
analysis
of
the
entire
screen
was
carried
out
to
highlight
cellular
mechanisms
involved
in
VACV
replication
.

This
revealed
,
as
anticipated
,
that
many
pro-viral
HFs
are
involved
in
translation
of
mRNA
and
,
unexpectedly
,
suggested
that
a
range
of
proteins
involved
in
cellular
transcriptional
processes
and
several
DNA
repair
pathways
possess
anti-viral
activity
.

Multiple
components
of
the
AMPK
complex
were
found
to
act
as
pro-viral
HFs
,
while
several
septins
,
a
group
of
highly
conserved
GTP
binding
proteins
with
a
role
in
sequestering
intracellular
bacteria
,
were
identified
as
strong
anti-viral
VACV
HFs
.

This
screen
has
identified
novel
and
previously
unexplored
roles
for
cellular
factors
in
poxvirus
replication
.

This
advancement
in
our
understanding
of
the
VACV
life
cycle
provides
a
reliable
knowledge
base
for
the
improvement
of
poxvirus-based
vaccine
vectors
and
development
of
anti-viral
theraputics
.

Background
:
Respiratory
viruses
,
such
as
influenza
viruses
,
initially
infect
the
upper
airways
but
can
manifest
as
severe
lower
respiratory
tract
infections
in
high-risk
patients
with
significant
morbidity
and
mortality
.

For
syndromic
diagnosis
,
several
multiplex
nucleic
acid
amplification
tests
have
been
developed
for
clinics
,
of
which
SureX

Multiplex
Kit
(

)
can
simultaneously
detect

of
this
assay
by
comparing
with

:
Ten
pathogens
were
detected
in
this
assay
,
of
which
rhinovirus
,
adenovirus
,
and
influenza

were
the
most
common
.

The
overall
agreement
between
the
ResP
and
the
comparator
tests
was
93.8
%
.

The
ResP
demonstrated
86.5

agreement
for
positive
results
and
97.8

Conclusion
:
The
ResP

comparing
with
pathogen-specific
PCRs
for
detection
of

Background
:
Since
2010
,
a
variant
Porcine
epidemic
diarrhea
virus
(
PEDV
)
,
which
causes
an
acute
,
highly
contagious
,
and
devastating
viral
enteric
disease
with
a
high
mortality
rate
in
suckling
pigs
,
broke
out
in
China
and
spread
rapidly
to
neighboring
countries
,
even
to
the
North
America
.

This
virus
gradually
became
the
main
subtype
of
PEDV
worldwide
.

However
,
there
were
no
reports
of
mild
pathogenicity
of
a
variant
porcine
epidemic
diarrhea
virus
in
China
.

Findings
:
In
2013
,
a
PEDV-positive
sample
from
a
sow
with
very
mild
clinical
sign
was
used
to
inoculate
in
Vero
cells
to
isolate
the
virus
.

This
PEDV
field
strain
,
designated
FL2013
strain
,
was
successfully
propagated
and
genetically
characterized
.

The
phylogenetic
trees
based
upon
either
the
complete
genome
or
S
gene
showed
that
the
FL2013
strain
belongs
to
the
genogroup
G2b
.

The
S
gene
of
FL2013
has
a
7-aa
deletion
(
FEKVHVQ
)
in
the
C-terminus
comparison
with
the
other
G2
PEDV
sequences
.

Further
comparative
pathology
study
indicated
that
the
FL2013
strain
had
reduced
virulence
to
newborn
piglets
.

Conclusions
:
A
novel
variant
PEDV
strain
FL2013
with
reduced
virulence
,
as
determined
by
the
pathological
study
,
was
identified
from
east
China
.

This
strain
is
closely
related
to
the
genogroup-2
PEDV
strains
prevalent
in
the
U.S.
and
China
currently
,
but
had
a
short
deletion
at
the
3′-end
of
the
spike
gene
.

Background
:
Neuropathology
caused
by
acute
viral
infection
of
the
brain
is
associated
with
the
development
of
persistent
neurological
deficits
.

Identification
of
the
immune
effectors
responsible
for
injuring
the
brain
during
acute
infection
is
necessary
for
the
development
of
therapeutic
strategies
that
reduce
neuropathology
but
maintain
immune
control
of
the
virus
.

Methods
:
The
identity
of
brain-infiltrating
leukocytes
was
determined
using
microscopy
and
flow
cytometry
at
several
acute
time
points
following
intracranial
infection
of
mice
with
the
Theiler
's
murine
encephalomyelitis
virus
.

Behavioral
consequences
of
immune
cell
depletion
were
assessed
by
Morris
water
maze
.

Results
:
Inflammatory
monocytes

defined
as
CD45

and

,
defined

CD45
hi
CD11b
+++
F4/80
-Gr1
+
1A8
+
,
were
found
in
the
brain
at
12
h
after
infection
.

Flow
cytometry
of
brain-infiltrating
leukocytes
collected
from
LysM
:
GFP
reporter
mice
confirmed
the
identification
of
neutrophils
and
inflammatory
monocytes
in
the
brain
.

Microscopy
of
sections
from
infected
LysM
:
GFP
mice
showed
that
infiltrating
cells
were
concentrated
in
the
hippocampal
formation
.

Immunostaining
confirmed
that
neutrophils
and
inflammatory
monocytes
were
localized
to
the
hippocampal
formation
at
12
h
after
infection
.

Immunodepletion
of
inflammatory
monocytes
and
neutrophils
but
not
of
neutrophils
only
resulted
in
preservation
of
hippocampal
neurons
.

Immunodepletion
of
inflammatory
monocytes
also
preserved
cognitive
function
as
assessed
by
the
Morris
water
maze
.

Conclusions
:
Neutrophils
and
inflammatory
monocytes
rapidly
and
robustly
responded
to
Theiler
's
virus
infection
by
infiltrating
the
brain
.

Inflammatory
monocytes
preceded
neutrophils
,
but
both
cell
types
were
present
in
the
hippocampal
formation
at
a
timepoint
that
is
consistent
with
a
role
in
triggering
hippocampal
pathology
.

Depletion
of
inflammatory
monocytes
and
neutrophils
with
the
Gr1
antibody
resulted
in
hippocampal
neuroprotection
and
preservation
of
cognitive
function
.

Specific
depletion
of
neutrophils
with
the
1A8
antibody
failed
to
preserve
neurons
,
suggesting
that
inflammatory
monocytes
are
the
key
effectors
of
brain
injury
during
acute
picornavirus
infection
of
the
brain
.

These
effector
cells
may
be
important
therapeutic
targets
for
immunomodulatory
or
immunosuppressive
therapies
aimed
at
reducing
or
preventing
central
nervous
system
pathology
associated
with
acute
viral
infection
.

The
majority
of
recently
emerging
infectious
diseases
in
humans
is
due
to
cross-species
pathogen
transmissions
from
animals
.

To
establish
a
productive
infection
in
new
host
species
,
viruses
must
overcome
barriers
to
replication
mediated
by
diverse
and
rapidly
evolving
host
restriction
factors
such
as
protein
kinase
R
(
PKR
)
.

Many
viral
antagonists
of
these
restriction
factors
are
species
specific
.

For
example
,
the
rhesus
cytomegalovirus
PKR
antagonist
,
RhTRS1
,
inhibits
PKR
in
some
African
green
monkey
(
AGM
)
cells
,
but
does
not
inhibit
human
or
rhesus
macaque
PKR
.

To
model
the
evolutionary
changes
necessary
for
cross-species
transmission
,
we
generated
a
recombinant
vaccinia
virus
that
expresses
RhTRS1
in
a
strain
that
lacks
PKR
inhibitors
E3L
and
K3L
(
VVDEDK+RhTRS1
)
.

Serially
passaging
VVDEDK+RhTRS1
in
minimally-permissive
AGM
cells
increased
viral
replication
10-to
100-fold
.

Notably
,
adaptation
in
these
AGM
cells
also
improved
virus
replication
1000-to
10,000-fold
in
human
and
rhesus
cells
.

Genetic
analyses
including
deep
sequencing
revealed
amplification
of
the
rhtrs1
locus
in
the
adapted
viruses
.

Supplying
additional
rhtrs1
in
trans
confirmed
that
amplification
alone
was
sufficient
to
improve
VVDEDK+RhTRS1
replication
.

Viruses
with
amplified
rhtrs1
completely
blocked
AGM
PKR
,
but
only
partially
blocked
human
PKR
,
consistent
with
the
replication
properties
of
these
viruses
in
AGM
and
human
cells
.

Finally
,
in
contrast
to
AGMadapted
viruses
,
which
could
be
serially
propagated
in
human
cells
,
VVDEDK+RhTRS1
yielded
no
progeny
virus
after
only
three
passages
in
human
cells
.

Thus
,
rhtrs1
amplification
in
a
minimally
permissive
intermediate
host
was
a
necessary
step
,
enabling
expansion
of
the
virus
range
to
previously
nonpermissive
hosts
.

These
data
support
the
hypothesis
that
amplification
of
a
weak
viral
antagonist
may
be
a
general
evolutionary
mechanism
to
permit
replication
in
otherwise
resistant
host
species
,
providing
a
molecular
foothold
that
could
enable
further
adaptations
necessary
for
efficient
replication
in
the
new
host
.

The
purpose
of
the
current
study
was
to
identify
potential
ligands
and
develop
a
novel
diagnostic
test
to
highly
pathogenic
avian
influenza
A
virus
(
HPAI
)
,
subtype
H5N1
viruses
using
phage
display
technology
.

The
H5N1
viruses
were
used
as
an
immobilized
target
in
a
biopanning
process
using
a
12-mer
phage
display
random
peptide
library
.

After
five
rounds
of
panning
,
three
phages
expressing
peptides
HAWDPIPARDPF
,
AAWHLIVALAPN
or
ATSHLHVRLPSK
had
a
specific
binding
activity
to
H5N1
viruses
were
isolated
.

Putative
binding
motifs
to
H5N1
viruses
were
identified
by
DNA
sequencing
.

In
terms
of
the
minimum
quantity
of
viruses
,
the
phage-based
ELISA
was
better
than
antiserum-based
ELISA
and
a
manual
,
semiquantitative
endpoint
RT-PCR
for
detecting
H5N1
viruses
.

More
importantly
,
the
selected
phages
bearing
the
specific
peptides
to
H5N1
viruses
were
capable
of
differentiating
this
virus
from
other
avian
viruses
in
enzyme-linked
immunosorbent
assays
.

As
the
predominant
aetiological
agent
of
the
common
cold
,
human
rhinovirus
(
HRV
)
is
the
leading
cause
of
human
infectious
disease
.

Early
studies
showed
that
a
monovalent
formalin-inactivated
HRV
vaccine
can
be
protective
,
and
virus-neutralizing
antibodies
(
nAb
)
correlated
with
protection
.

However
,
co-circulation
of
many
HRV
types
discouraged
further
vaccine
efforts
.

Here
,
we
test
the
hypothesis
that
increasing
virus
input
titres
in
polyvalent
inactivated
HRV
vaccine
may
result
in
broad
nAb
responses
.

We
show
that
serum
nAb
against
many
rhinovirus
types
can
be
induced
by
polyvalent
,
inactivated
HRVs
plus
alhydrogel
(
alum
)
adjuvant
.

Using
formulations
up
to
25-valent
in
mice
and
50-valent
in
rhesus
macaques
,
HRV
vaccine
immunogenicity
was
related
to
sufficient
quantity
of
input
antigens
,
and
valency
was
not
a
major
factor
for
potency
or
breadth
of
the
response
.

Thus
,
we
have
generated
a
vaccine
capable
of
inducing
nAb
responses
to
numerous
and
diverse
HRV
types
.

Macroalgae
are
increasingly
viewed
as
a
source
of
secondary
metabolites
with
great
potential
for
the
development
of
new
drugs
.

In
this
development
,
in
vitro
studies
are
only
the
first
step
in
a
long
process
,
while
in
vivo
studies
and
clinical
trials
are
the
most
revealing
stages
of
the
true
potential
and
limitations
that
a
given
metabolite
may
have
as
a
new
drug
.

This
literature
review
aims
to
give
a
critical
overview
of
the
secondary
metabolites
that
reveal
the
most
interesting
results
in
these
two
steps
.

Phlorotannins
show
great
pharmaceutical
potential
in
in
vivo
models
and
,
among
the
several
examples
,
the
anti-dyslipidemia
activity
of
dieckol
must
be
highlighted
because
it
was
more
effective
than
lovastatin
in
an
in
vivo
model
.

The
IRLIIVLMPILMA
tridecapeptide
that
exhibits
an
in
vivo
level
of
activity
similar
to
the
hypotensive
clinical
drug
captopril
should
still
be
stressed
,
as
well
as
griffithsin
which
showed
such
stunning
results
over
a
variety
of
animal
models
and
which
will
probably
move
onto
clinical
trials
soon
.

Regarding
clinical
trials
,
studies
with
pure
algal
metabolites
are
scarce
,
limited
to
those
carried
out
with
kahalalide
F
and
fucoxanthin
.

The
majority
of
clinical
trials
currently
aim
to
ascertain
the
effect
of
algae
consumption
,
as
extracts
or
fractions
,
on
obesity
and
diabetes
.

Cytotoxic
CD8
+
T
lymphocytes
(
CTL
)
efficiently
control
acute
virus
infections
but
can
become
exhausted
when
a
chronic
infection
develops
.

The
checkpoint
receptor
PD-1
suppresses
the
functionality
of
virus-specific
CD8
+
T
cells
during
chronic
infection
.

However
,
the
role
of
the
PD-L1/PD-1
pathway
during
the
acute
phase
of
infections
has
not
been
well
characterized
.

In
the
current
study
the
effects
of
PD-1
or
PD-L1
deficiency
on
the
CD8
+
T
cell
response
against
Friend
retroviral
(
FV
)
infection
of
knockout
mice
was
analyzed
during
acute
infection
.

We
observed
an
enhanced
proliferation
,
functional
maturation
,
and
reduced
apoptosis
of
effector
CD8
+
T
cells
in
the
absence
of
PD-1
or
PD-L1
.

The
knockout
of
PD-L1
had
a
stronger
effect
on
the
functionality
of
CD8
+
T
cells
than
that
of
PD-1
.

Augmented
CTL
responses
were
associated
with
an
improved
control
of
FV
replication
.

The
strong
phenotype
of
FV-infected
PD-L1
knockout
mice
was
independent
of
the
interaction
with
CD80
as
an
additional
receptor
for
PD-L1
.

Furthermore
,
we
performed
a
detailed
analysis
of
the
production
of
different
granzymes
in
virus-specific
CD8
+
T
cells
and
observed
that
especially
the
simultaneous
production
of
multiple
granzymes
in
individual
T
cells
(
multifunctionality
)
was
under
the
control
of
the
PD-1/PD-L1
pathway
.

The
findings
from
this
study
allow
for
a
better
understanding
of
the
development
of
antiviral
cytotoxic
immunity
during
acute
viral
infections
.

Vector-borne
infectious
diseases
,
such
as
malaria
,
dengue
,
chikungunya
,
and
West
Nile
fevers
are
increasingly
identified
as
major
global
human
health
threats
in
developing
and
developed
countries
.

The
success
or
failure
of
vector
control
rests
mainly
on
the
nature
and
scale
of
the
behavioural
response
of
exposed
populations
.

Large-scale
adoption
of
recommended
protective
behaviour
represents
a
critical
challenge
that
can
not
be
addressed
without
a
better
understanding
of
how
individuals
perceive
and
react
to
the
risk
of
infection
.

Recently
,
French
overseas
territories
faced
large-scale
outbreaks
:
an
epidemic
of
chikungunya
fever
in
La
Réunion
and
Mayotte
(
2005
)
(
2006
)
and
four
successive
outbreaks
of
dengue
fever
in
one
Caribbean
island
,
Martinique
(
1995Martinique
(
-2007
.

To
assess
how
these
populations
perceived
and
responded
to
the
risk
,
and
how
the
nature
and
scale
of
protection
affected
their
clinical
status
,
socioepidemiological
surveys
were
conducted
on
each
island
during
the
outbreaks
.

These
surveys
address
three
crucial
and
interconnected
questions
relevant
to
the
period
after
persons
infected
by
the
virus
were
identified
:
which
factors
shape
the
risk
of
acquiring
disease
?

Which
sociodemographic
characteristics
and
living
conditions
induce
a
higher
likelihood
of
infection
?

What
is
the
impact
of
risk
perception
on
protective
behaviours
adopted
against
mosquito
bites
?

Grounded
on
the
results
of
these
surveys
,
a
general
framework
is
proposed
to
help
draw
out
the
knowledge
needed
to
reveal
the
factors
associated
with
higher
probability
of
infection
as
an
outbreak
emerges
.

The
lessons
learnt
can
inform
health
authorities
'
efforts
to
improve
risk
communication
programmes
,
both
in
terms
of
the
target
and
content
of
messages
,
so
as
to
explore
new
strategies
for
ensuring
sustainable
protective
behaviour
.

The
authors
compare
three
epidemics
of
vector-borne
diseases
to
elucidate
psychosocial
factors
that
determine
how
populations
perceive
and
respond
to
the
risk
of
infectious
disease

negative
emotions

Background
:
Veterinary
infection
control
for
the
management
of
Hendra
virus
(
HeV
)
,
an
emerging
zoonosis
in
Australia
,
remained
suboptimal
until
2010
despite
71.4
%
(
5/7
)
of
humans
infected
with
HeV
being
veterinary
personnel
or
assisting
a
veterinarian
,
three
of
whom
died
before
2009
.

The
aim
of
this
study
was
to
identify
the
perceived
barriers
to
veterinary
infection
control
and
HeV
management
in
private
veterinary
practice
in
Queensland
,
where
the
majority
of
HeV
outbreaks
have
occurred
in
Australia
.

Results
:
Most
participants
agreed
that
a
number
of
key
factors
had
contributed
to
the
slow
uptake
of
adequate
infection
control
measures
for
the
management
of
HeV
amongst
private
veterinarians
:
a
work
culture
characterised
by
suboptimal
infection
control
standards
and
misconceptions
about
zoonotic
risks
;
a
lack
of
leadership
and
support
from
government
authorities
;
the
difficulties
of
managing
biosecurity
and
public
health
issues
from
a
private
workforce
perspective
;
and
the
slow
pattern
of
emergence
of
HeV
.

By
2010
,
some
infection
control
and
HeV
management
changes
had
been
implemented
.

Participants
interviewed
agreed
that
further
improvements
remained
necessary
;
but
also
cautioned
that
this
was
a
complex
process
which
would
require
time
.

Conclusion
:
Private
veterinarians
and
government
authorities
prior
to
2009
were
unprepared
to
handle
new
slowly
emerging
zoonoses
,
which
may
explain
their
mismanagement
of
HeV
.

Slowly
emerging
zoonoses
may
be
of
low
public
health
significance
but
of
high
significance
for
specialised
groups
such
as
veterinarians
.

Private
veterinarians
,
who
are
expected
to
fulfil
an
active
biosecurity
and
public
health
role
in
the
frontline
management
of
such
emerging
zoonoses
,
need
government
agencies
to
better
recognise
their
contribution
,
to
consult
with
the
veterinary
profession
when
devising
guidelines
for
the
management
of
zoonoses
and
to
provide
them
with
greater
leadership
and
support
.

We
propose
that
specific
infection
control
guidelines
for
the
management
of
slowly
emerging
zoonoses
in
private
veterinary
settings
need
to
be
developed

Parkinson
's
disease
(
PD
)
is
characterized
by
dopaminergic
neuronal
loss
in
the
substantia
nigra
pars
compacta
(
SNPC
)
and
the
striatum
.

Nuclear
receptor-related
1
protein
(
Nurr1
)
is
a
nuclear
hormone
receptor
implicated
in
limiting
mitochondrial
dysfunction
,
apoptosis
,
and
inflammation
in
the
central
nervous
system
and
protecting
dopaminergic
neurons
and
a
promising
therapeutic
target
for
PD
.

Cicadidae
Periostracum
(
CP
)
,
the
cast-off
skin
of
Cryptotympana
pustulata
Fabricius
,
has
been
used
in
traditional
medicine
for
its
many
clinical
pharmacological
effects
,
including
the
treatment
of
psychological
symptoms
in
PD
.

However
,
scientific
evidence
for
the
use
of
CP
in
neurodegenerative
diseases
,
including
PD
,
is
lacking
.

Here
,
we
investigated
the
protective
effects
of
CP
on
1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine-
(
MPTP-
)
induced
PD
in
mice
and
explored
the
underlying
mechanisms
of
action
,
focusing
on
Nurr1
.

CP
increased
the
expression
levels
of
Nurr1
,
tyrosine
hydroxylase
,
DOPA
decarboxylase
,
dopamine
transporter
,
and
vesicular
monoamine
transporter
2
via
extracellular
signal-regulated
kinase
phosphorylation
in
differentiated
PC12
cells
and
the
mouse
SNPC
.

In
MPTP-induced
PD
,
CP
promoted
recovery
from
movement
impairments
.

CP
prevented
dopamine
depletion
and
protected
against
dopaminergic
neuronal
degradation
via
mitochondria-mediated
apoptotic
proteins
such
as
B-cell
lymphoma
2
(
Bcl-2
)
,
Bcl-2-associated
X
,
cytochrome
c
,
and
cleaved
caspase-9
and
caspase-3
by
inhibiting
MPTP-induced
neuroinflammatory
cytokines
,
inducible
nitric
oxide
synthase
,
cyclooxygenase
2
,
and
glial/microglial
activation
.

Moreover
,
CP
inhibited
lipopolysaccharide-induced
neuroinflammatory
cytokines
and
response
levels
and
glial/microglial
activation
in
BV2
microglia
and
the
mouse
brain
.

Our
findings
suggest
that
CP
might
contribute
to
neuroprotective
signaling
by
regulating
neurotrophic
factors
primarily
via
Nurr1
signaling
,
neuroinflammation
,
and
mitochondria-mediated
apoptosis
.

The
gammacoronavirus
infectious
bronchitis
virus
(
IBV
)
causes
an
acute
,
highly
contagious
respiratory
disease
of
poultry
.

Live
attenuated
vaccines
are
traditionally
generated
by
serial
passage
of
a
virulent
strain
in
embryonated
chicken
eggs
;
however
,
the
molecular
mechanism
of
attenuation
is
unknown
.

M41-CK
,
a
virulent
lab-adapted
strain
of
IBV
,
was
egg
passaged
over
100
times
in
four
parallel
independent
replicates
.

All
four
final
egg-passaged
viruses
were
attenuated
in
vivo
and
exhibited
similar
growth
phenotypes
in
adult
chicken
kidney
cells
and
ex
vivo
tracheal
organ
cultures
.

The
virus
populations
were
sequenced
by
454
pyrosequencing
at
the
end
of
passaging
,
and
the
results
showed
that
overall
sequence
diversity
in
the
IBV
population
increased
but
the
four
replicates
only
had
between
11
and
17
consensus-level
single
nucleotide
polymorphisms
(
SNPs
)
.

Although
hot
spots
of
variation
were
identified
in
spike
and
nucleocapsid
structural
proteins
as
well
as
the
3=
untranslated
region
,
each
attenuated
virus
possessed
a
different
pattern
of
genomic
variation
.

Overall
,
only
a
small
number
of
consensus-level
SNPs
were
acquired
during
egg
passage
,
leaving
a
potentially
short
route
back
to
virulence
.

These
results
highlight
the
unpredictable
nature
of
attenuation
by
serial
egg
passage
and
the
need
to
develop
mechanisms
to
rationally
attenuate
IBV
for
the
next
generation
of
effective

IMPORTANCE
Infectious
bronchitis
remains
a
major
problem
in
the
global
poultry
industry
,
despite
the
existence
of
many
different
vaccines
.

IBV
vaccines
are
currently
developed
by
serial
passage
of
a
virulent
strain
on
embryonated
hen
's
eggs
until
attenuation
;
however
,
little
is
known
about
the
evolution
of
the
viral
population
during
the
process
of
attenuation
.

High-throughput
sequencing
of
four
replicates
of
a
serially
egg-passaged
IBV
revealed
a
different
pattern
of
genomic
variation
in
each
attenuated
replicate
and
few
consensus-level
SNPs
.

This
raises
concerns
that
only
a
small
number
of
genomic
mutations
are
required
to
revert
to
a
virulent
phenotype
,
which
may
result
in
vaccine
breakdown
in
the
field
.

The
observed
hot
spots
of
variation
in
the
attenuated
viruses
have
the
potential
to
be
used
in
the
rational
attenuation
of
virulent
IBV
for
next-generation
vaccine
design
.

Background
:
Since
2008
,
a
progressive
pneumonia
has
become
prevalent
in
broilers
and
laying
hens
.

This
disease
occurrs
the
first
day
after
hatching
and
lasts
more
than
30
days
,
resulting
in
approximately
70
%
morbidity
and
30
%
mortality
in
broilers
.

The
objective
of
this
study
was
to
isolate
and
identify
the
pathogens
that
are
responsible
for
the
progressive
pneumonia
and
establish
an
animal
model
for
drug
screening
.

Results
:
193
serum
samples
were
collected
from
8
intensive
farms
from
5
provinces
in
China
and
analysed
in
the
current
research
.

Our
clinical
survey
showed
that
65.2
%
to
100
%
of
breeding
broilers
,
breeding
layers
,
broilers
and
laying
hens
were
seropositive
for
ORT
antibodies
.

From
8
intensive
farms
,
six
ORT
isolates
were
identified
by
PCR
and
biochemical
assays
,
and
two
H9N2
viruses
were
isolated
.

Newcastle
Disease
Virus
(
NDV
)
and
Infectious
BronchitisVirus
(
IBV
)
were
excluded
.

Typical
pneumonia
and
airsacculitis
were
observed
both
in
broilers
inoculated
intraperitoneally
with
an
ORT
isolate
alone
and
in
those
co-infected
with
ORT
and
H9N2
virus
isolates
.

Specifically
,
the
survival
rate
was
30
%
,
20
%
,
70
%
,
50
%
and
90
%
in
birds
inoculated
with
ORT+H9N2
virus
,
ORT
followed
by
H9N2
virus
,
H9N2
virus
followed
by
ORT
,
and
ORT
or
H9N2
virus
alone
,
respectively
.

Conclusions
:
The
results
of
this
study
suggest
that
ORT
infections
of
domestic
poultry
have
been
occurring
frequently
in
China
.

ORT
infection
can
induce
higher
economic
losses
and
mortality
if
H9N2
AIV
is
also
present
.

Although
the
isolation
of
ORT
and
H9N2
virus
has
been
reported
previously
,
there
have
been
no
reported
co-infections
of
poultry
with
these
two
pathogens
.

This
is
the
first
report
of
co-infection
of
broilers
with
ORT
and
H9N2
virus
,
and
this
co-infection
is
probably
associated
with
the
outbreak
of
broiler
airsacculitis
in
China
,
which
has
caused
extensive
economic
losses
.

RNA-protein
interactions
(
RPIs
)
have
critical
roles
in
numerous
fundamental
biological
processes
,
such
as
post-transcriptional
gene
regulation
,
viral
assembly
,
cellular
defence
and
protein
synthesis
.

As
the
number
of
available
RNA-protein
binding
experimental
data
has
increased
rapidly
due
to
high-throughput
sequencing
methods
,
it
is
now
possible
to
measure
and
understand
RNA-protein
interactions
by
computational
methods
.

In
this
study
,
we
integrate
a
sequence-based
derived
kernel
with
regularized
least
squares
to
perform
prediction
.

The
derived
kernel
exploits
the
contextual
information
around
an
amino
acid
or
a
nucleic
acid
as
well
as
the
repetitive
conserved
motif
information
.

We
propose
a
novel
machine
learning
method
,
called
RPiRLS
to
predict
the
interaction
between
any
RNA
and
protein
of
known
sequences
.

For
the
RPiRLS
classifier
,
each
protein
sequence
comprises
up
to
20
diverse
amino
acids
but
for
the
RPiRLS-7G
classifier
,
each
protein
sequence
is
represented
by
using
7-letter
reduced
alphabets
based
on
their
physiochemical
properties
.

We
evaluated
both
methods
on
a
number
of
benchmark
data
sets
and
compared
their
performances
with
two
newly
developed
and
state-of-the-art
methods
,
RPI-Pred
and
IPMiner
.

On
the
non-redundant
benchmark
test
sets
extracted
from
the
PRIDB
,
the
RPiRLS
method
outperformed
RPI-Pred
and
IPMiner
in
terms
of
accuracy
,
specificity
and
sensitivity
.

Further
,
RPiRLS
achieved
an
accuracy
of
92
%
on
the
prediction
of
lncRNA-protein
interactions
.

The
proposed
method
can
also
be
extended
to
construct
RNA-protein
interaction
networks
.

The
emergence
of
Middle
East
respiratory
syndrome
coronavirus
(
MERS-CoV
)
as
a
cause
of
severe
respiratory
disease
highlights
the
need
for
effective
approaches
to
CoV
vaccine
development
.

Efforts
focused
solely
on
the
receptor-binding
domain
(
RBD
)
of
the
viral
Spike
(
S
)
glycoprotein
may
not
optimize
neutralizing
antibody
(
NAb
)
responses
.

Here
we
show
that
immunogens
based
on
full-length
S
DNA
and
S1
subunit
protein
elicit
robust
serumneutralizing
activity
against
several
MERS-CoV
strains
in
mice
and
non-human
primates
.

Serological
analysis
and
isolation
of
murine
monoclonal
antibodies
revealed
that
immunization
elicits
NAbs
to
RBD
and
,
non-RBD
portions
of
S1
and
S2
subunit
.

Multiple
neutralization
mechanisms
were
demonstrated
by
solving
the
atomic
structure
of
a
NAb-RBD
complex
,
through
sequencing
of
neutralization
escape
viruses
and
by
constructing
MERS-CoV
S
variants
for
serological
assays
.

Immunization
of
rhesus
macaques
confers
protection
against
MERS-CoV-induced
radiographic
pneumonia
,
as
assessed
using
computerized
tomography
,
supporting
this
strategy
as
a
promising
approach
for
MERS-CoV
vaccine
development
.

we
analysed
the
expression
of
clinically
important
pro-inflammatory
and
immune-modulatory
cytokines
.

IAV
infection
or
treatment
with
supernatants
from
IAV-infected
cell
cultures
resulted
in
priming
of
the
DCs
which
subsequently
influenced
the
production
of
IL-12p70
,
as
well
as
IL-6
,
following
SP
infection
.

Co-infection
of
the
same
cell
was
not
required
but
this
effect
was
dependent
on
the
time
,
dose
and
duration
of
the
infections
,
as
well
as
pathogen
viability
,
bacterial
uptake
and
endosome
acidification
.

Bacterially
infected
cells
were
characterized
as
the
main
producers
of
IL-12p70
.

Finally
,
we
showed
that
type
I
interferons
were
primarily
responsible
for
the
priming
of
IL-12p70
that
was
observed
by
infection
with
IAV
.

These
results
provide
a
probable
mechanism
for
the
elevated
levels
of
particular
cytokines
observed
in
IAV
and
SP
co-infected
cell
cultures
with
implications
for
the
pathogenic
outcome
observed
during
in
vivo
infection
.

Virus
surveillance
in
vector
insects
is
potentially
of
great
benefit
to
public
health
.

Large-scale
sequencing
of
small
and
long
RNAs
has
previously
been
used
to
detect
viruses
,
but
without
any
formal
comparison
of
different
strategies
.

Furthermore
,
the
identification
of
viral
sequences
largely
depends
on
similarity
searches
against
reference
databases
.

Here
,
we
developed
a
sequence-independent
strategy
based
on
virus-derived
small
RNAs
produced
by
the
host
response
,
such
as
the
RNA
interference
pathway
.

In
insects
,
we
compared
sequences
of
small
and
long
RNAs
,
demonstrating
that
viral
sequences
are
enriched
in
the
small
RNA
fraction
.

We
also
noted
that
the
small
RNA
size
profile
is
a
unique
signature
for
each
virus
and
can
be
used
to
identify
novel
viral
sequences
without
known
relatives
in
reference
databases
.

Using
this
strategy
,
we
characterized
six
novel
viruses
in
the
viromes
of
laboratory
fruit
flies
and
wild
populations
of
two
insect
vectors
:
mosquitoes
and
sandflies
.

We
also
show
that
the
small
RNA
profile
could
be
used
to
infer
viral
tropism
for
ovaries
among
other
aspects
of
virus
biology
.

Additionally
,
our
results
suggest
that
virus
detection
utilizing
small
RNAs
can
also
be
applied
to
vertebrates
,
although
not
as
efficiently
as
to
plants
and
insects
.

The
role
of
host
genetic
variation
in
pneumonia
development
and
outcome
is
poorly
understood
.

We
studied
common
polymorphisms
in
the
genes
of
proinflammatory
cytokines
(
IL6
rs1800795
,
IL8
rs4073
,
IL1B
rs16944
)
,
anti-inflammatory
cytokines
(
IL10
rs1800896
,
IL4
rs2243250
,
IL13
rs20541
)
and
toll-like
receptors
(
TLR2
rs5743708
and
rs4696480
,
TLR4
rs4986791
,
TLR9
rs352139
,
rs5743836
and
rs187084
)
in
patients
with
community-acquired
pneumonia
(
CAP
)
(
390
cases
,
203
controls
)
and
nosocomial
pneumonia
(
355
cases
,
216
controls
)
.

Experimental
data
were
included
in
a
series
of
11
meta-analyses
and
eight
subset
analyses
related
to
pneumonia
susceptibility
and
outcome
.

TLR2
rs5743708
minor
genotype
appeared
to
be
associated
with
CAP/Legionnaires
'
disease/pneumococcal
disease
.

In
CAP
patients
,
the
IL6
rs1800795-C
allele
was
associated
with
severe
sepsis/septic
shock/severe
systemic
inflammatory
response
,
while
the
IL10
rs1800896-A
allele
protected
against
the
development
of
these
critical
conditions
.

To
contribute
to
deciphering
of
the
above
results
,
we
performed
an
in
silico
analysis
and
a
qualitative
synthesis
of
literature
data
addressing
basal
and
stimulated
genotype-specific
expression
level
.

This
data
together
with
database
information
on
transcription
factors
'
affinity
changes
caused
by
SNPs
in
putative
promoter
regions
,
the
results
of
linkage
disequilibrium
analysis
along
with
SNPs
functional
annotations
supported
assumptions
about
the
complexity
underlying
the
revealed
associations
.

Pneumonia
,
one
of
the
most
common
infectious
diseases
,
is
associated
with
high
morbidity
and
mortality
worldwide
.

Pneumonia
is
classified
according
to
the
site
of
acquisition
as
community-acquired
(
CAP
)
and
hospital-acquired
(
or
nosocomial
)
pneumonia
(
HAP
or
NP
)
,
which
includes
healthcare-associated
pneumonia
(
HCAP
)
and
ventilator-associated
pneumonia
(
VAP
)
.

HAP
tends
to
be
a
more
serious
problem
than
CAP
since
HAP
patients
have
an
increased
risk
of
infection
caused
by
antibiotic-resistant
organisms
,
besides
they
are
often
older
and
burdened
by
comorbidities
.

Pneumonia
is
considered
to
be
the
the
most
prevalent
cause
of
sepsis
associated
with
the
highest
mortality
rates
1
.

In
infection
,
host
genetic
background
may
be
of
even
more
importance
than
in
cancer
and
cardiovascular
diseases
which
are
known
to
have
a
high
hereditary
component
2
.

Most
infectious
phenotypes
result
from
a
complex
interplay
between
multiple
genetic
factors
related
to
host
and
pathogen
genetics
and
a
variety
of
non-genetic
factors
.

Since
infectious
diseases
are
related
to
immune-mediated
disorders
,
genetic
susceptibility
loci
for
immune
traits
can
be
considered
as
good
candidates
in
genetic
association
studies
of
pneumonia
and
its
complications
3
.

The
first
line
of
defence
of
the
innate
immune
system
is
represented
by
pattern-recognition
receptors
that
sense
bacterial
,
viral
or
fungal
molecular
structures
and
induce
systemic
inflammation
.

The
most
studied
class
of
pattern-recognition
receptors
is
that
of
the
toll-like
receptors
(
TLRs
)
.

Once
inflammation
has
been
launched
a
crosstalk
between
pro-and
anti-inflammatory
branches
of
the
immune
response
should
provide
a
balanced
immune
reaction
crucial
for
a
favorable
resolution
of
infection
.

Genetic
studies
of
pneumonia
are
not
numerous
while
investigations
assessing
the
role
of
host
genetics
in
sepsis
due
to
pneumonia
are
even
more
unfrequent
.

Furthermore
,
to
date
there
are
no
GWAS
reported
for
pneumonia
.

Meta-analyses
of
genetic
susceptibility

The
vacuolar-type
H
+
-ATPase
(
v-ATPase
)
is
the
major
proton
pump
that
acidifies
intracellular
compartments
of
eukaryotic
cells
.

Since
the
inhibition
of
v-ATPase
resulted
in
anti-tumor
and
anti-metastatic
effects
in
different
tumor
models
,
this
enzyme
has
emerged
as
promising
strategy
against
cancer
.

Here
,
we
used
the
well-established
v-ATPase
inhibitor
archazolid
,
a
natural
product
first
isolated
from
the
myxobacterium
Archangium
gephyra
,
to
study
the
consequences
of
v-ATPase
inhibition
in
endothelial
cells
(
ECs
)
,
in
particular
on
the
interaction
between
ECs
and
cancer
cells
,
which
has
been
neglected
so
far
.

Human
endothelial
cells
treated
with
archazolid
showed
an
increased
adhesion
of
tumor
cells
,
whereas
the
transendothelial
migration
of
tumor
cells
was
reduced
.

The
adhesion
process
was
independent
from
the
EC
adhesion
molecules
ICAM-1
,
VCAM-1
,
E-selectin
and
N-cadherin
.

Instead
,
the
adhesion
was
mediated
by
β1-integrins
expressed
on
tumor
cells
,
as
blocking
of
the
integrin
β1
subunit
reversed
this
process
.

Tumor
cells
preferentially
adhered
to
the
β1-integrin
ligand
collagen
and
archazolid
led
to
an
increase
in
the
amount
of
collagen
on
the
surface
of
ECs
.

The
accumulation
of
collagen
was
accompanied
by
a
strong
decrease
of
the
expression
and
activity
of
the
protease
cathepsin
B.
Overexpression
of
cathepsin
B
in
ECs
prevented
the
capability
of
archazolid
to
increase
the
adhesion
of
tumor
cells
onto
ECs
.

Our
study
demonstrates
that
the
inhibition
of
v-ATPase
by
archazolid
induces
a
pro-adhesive
phenotype
in
endothelial
cells
that
promotes
their
interaction
with
cancer
cells
,
whereas
the
transmigration
of
tumor
cells
was
reduced
.

These
findings
further
support
archazolid
as
a
promising
anti-metastatic
compound

Background
:
Bronchiolitis
obliterans
organizing
pneumonia
(
BOOP
)
is
a
type
of
diffuse
interstitial
lung
disease
characterized
by
the
pathology
of
fibroblastic
plugs
in
the
lumens
of
the
respiratory
bronchioles
,
alveolar
ducts
,
and
alveoli
.

The
occurrence
of
BOOP
in
human
immunodeficiency
virus
(
HIV
)
-infected
patients
has
rarely
been
described
,
and
there
have
been
no
clinical
case
reports
in
Korea
.

Case
presentation
:
A
24-year-old
female
who
had
been
diagnosed
with
HIV
ten
years
prior
was
admitted
due
to
a
1-year
history
of
cough
and
sputum
production
and
a
3-day
history
of
fever
.

She
had
poor
adherence
to
anti-retroviral
therapy
(
ART
)
due
to
gastrointestinal
troubles
.

At
the
time
of
admission
,
her
CD4
T-cell
count
was
5
cells/mm
3
.

A
high
resolution
computed
tomography
(
CT
)
scan
showed
tiny
centrilobular
nodules
with
a
tree-in-bud
pattern
in
both
lungs
.

Bacterial
culture
,
Pneumocystis
jirovecii
polymerase
chain
reaction
(
PCR
)
,
Aspergillus
galactomannan
antigen
(
Ag
)
assay
,
and
respiratory
virus
PCR
were
negative
.

Rapid
chest
x-ray
improvement
was
seen
after
a
7-day
treatment
with
anti-tuberculosis
medication
,
ceftriaxone
,
and
clarithromycin
.

Miliary
tuberculosis
seemed
unlikely
considering
the
rapid
radiologic
improvement
and
negative
tuberculosis
PCR
results
.

Due
to
the
unknown
etiology
,
we
performed
video-assisted
thoracoscopic
surgery
(
VATS
)
to
determine
the
cause
of
the
diffuse
lung
infiltration
.

Pathologic
findings
were
consistent
with
BOOP
,
while
tissue
acid-fast
bacilli
(
AFB
)
stain
and
tuberculosis
PCR
results
were
negative
.

Tuberculosis
medication
and
intravenous
ceftriaxone
were
discontinued
,
while
treatment
with
clarithromycin
monotherapy
was
sustained
.

Five
months
after
discharge
,
the
patient
was
asymptomatic
with
a
normal
chest
x-ray
and
as
her
adherence
to
ART
improved
,
her
CD4
T-cell
count
rose
to
181
cells/mm
3
.

Clarithromycin
was
discontinued
at
that
time
and
the
patient
is
currently
receiving
regular
outpatient
follow-up
.

Conclusion
:
This
case
suggests
that
macrolides
are
a
potential
treatment
option
in
HIV-infected
patients
with
mild
BOOP
.

In
cases
that
are
otherwise
unexplained
or
unresponsive
to
treatment
,
BOOP
should
be
taken
into
consideration
and
surgical
biopsy
performed
to
confirm
a
diagnosis
of
BOOP
.

Autophagy
,
a
highly
regulated
degradative
process
that
promotes
cellular
homeostasis
,
is
increasingly
recognised
as
a
fundamental
component
of
the
cellular
response
against
viral
infection
.

In
this
study
,
we
investigated
the
role
of
autophagy
during
Junín
virus
(
JUNV
)
multiplication
using
human
A549
cells
.

We
found
that
JUNV
infection
induces
an
increment
of
the
LC3-II/LC3-I
ratio
,
an
accumulation
of
punctate
pattern
in
RFP-LC3-transfected
cells
and
the
colocalisation
of
viral
nucleoprotein
and
LC3
protein
,
suggesting
autophagosome
formation
.

JUNV
infection
also
induced
the
degradation
of
the
autophagy
receptor
p62
,
suggesting
that
complete
autophagic
flux
was
triggered
.

In
addition
,
we
showed
that
inhibition
of
autophagy
with
bafilomycin
A1
or
3-methyladenine
significantly
reduces
viral
multiplication
.

Moreover
,
viral
yield
was
increased
when
autophagy
was
induced
using
rapamycin
.

Furthermore
,
JUNV
infection
induced
the
colocalisation
of
p62
,
ATG16
,
RAB5
,
RAB7A
and
LAMP1
with
the
autophagosomal
LC3
protein
.

That
suggests
that
phagosomes
undergo
the
maturation
process
during
viral
infection
.

Finally
,
we
demonstrated
that
siRNA
experiments
targeting
essential
autophagy
genes
(
ATG5
,
ATG7
and
Beclin
1
)
reduce
viral
protein
synthesis
and
viral
yield
.

Overall
,
our
results
indicate
that
JUNV
activates
host
autophagy
machinery
enhancing
its
multiplication
.

phosphatidylinositol
3-kinase
(
PI3K
)
complex
(
which
includes
Beclin
1
and
VPS34
)
and
the
ATG12
(
ATG12-ATG5-ATG16
)
and
LC3
complexes
[
4
]
.

The
activation
of
PI3K
results
in
the
recruitment
of
the
ATG12
complex
to
isolation
membranes
and
the
lipidation
of
the
LC3
.

This
lipidated
form
of
LC3
,
known
as
LC3-II
,
is
associated
with
the
internal
and
external
surface
of
the
expanding
phagophores
and
is
generally
used
as
a
marker
of
autophagosomes
[
5
]
.

The
association
of
LC3-II
to
the
membrane
is
related
to
the
expansion
of
the
isolation
membrane
and
closure
of
autophagosomes
.

After
fusion
with
late
endosomes
or
lysosomes
,
the
autophagosome
becomes
an
autolysosome
,
where
LC3-II
is
partly
degraded
and
partly
delipidated
and
recycled
[

.

Functional
autophagy
is
essential
for
cell
viability
under
stress
conditions
,
including
viral
infections
[
7
,
8
]
.

This
cellular
process
can
be
antiviral
or
proviral
,
depending
on
the
virus
and
the
cellular
context
.

A
central
aspect
of
the
autophagic
antiviral
activity
is
to
promote
viral
clearance
by
degradation
of
viral
components
.

Moreover
,
autophagy
also
contributes
to
the
innate
and
adaptive
immunity
by
boosting
the
delivery
of
Toll-like
receptor
ligands
to
endosomes
or
by
feeding
antigens
to
the
MHC
class
II
pathway
[
7
,
9
]
.

On
the
other
hand
,
some
viruses
take
advantage
of
autophagy
by
using
elements
of
the
autophagic
machinery
to
ensure
a
proper
cellular
platform
for
replication
[

or
by
benefiting
from
the
rearrangement
of
cellular
lipid
metabolism
in
order
to
support
stronger
viral
replication
[

]
.

Therefore
,
the
interaction
of
viruses
with
the
host
autophagy
machinery
may
be
a
crucial
mechanism
for
cell
survival
and
could
determines
infection
outcome
.

The
family
Arenaviridae
currently
includes
two
genera
,
Mammarenavirus
(
mammals
)
and
Reptarenavirus
(

)
[

]
.

On
the
basis
of
serological
,
geographical
and
genetic
evidence
,
the
mammarenaviruses
are
subdivided
into

The
mammarenaviruses
are
generally
associated
with
infection
in
rodents
,
but
some
are
responsible
for
fatal
diseases

fever
(

)
caused
by

Therefore
,
the
hemorrhagic
fever-causing
mammarenaviruses
are
recognised
to
pose
a
significant
threat
to
public
health

are

it

employs
alternative

Moreover
,
it
has
been
demonstrated
that
clathrin-mediated
endocytosis
is
the
main
route
used
by

involves
the

other
cellular
proteins

Genome

In
particular
,
JUNV
internalisation
leads
to

and
requires
both

However
,
the
interplay
between
the
mechanisms
and
regulation
of
intracellular
trafficking
and
the
arenavirus
life
cycle
remains
mostly
unexplored
.

In
individuals
with
AHF
,
the
severity
and
prognosis
of
the
disease
correlate
with
high
levels
of
IFN

Several
proteins
involved
in
the
IFN
signalling
mechanisms
are
also
implicated
in
the
regulation
of
autophagy
[

Moreover
,
recent
studies
show
that
autophagy
plays
a
critical
role
in
the
production
of
IFN
during
viral

Therefore
,
we

Theiler
's
murine
encephalomyelitis
virus
(
TMEV
)
is
a
member
of
the
genus
Cardiovirus
in
the
Picornaviridae
,
a
family
of
positive-sense
single-stranded
RNA
viruses
.

Previously
,
we
demonstrated
that
in
the
related
cardiovirus
,
Encephalomyocarditis
virus
,
a
programmed
؊1
ribosomal
frameshift
(
؊1
PRF
)
occurs
at
a
conserved
G_GUU_UUU
sequence
within
the
2B-encoding
region
of
the
polyprotein
open
reading
frame
(
ORF
)
.

Here
we
show
that
؊1
PRF
occurs
at
a
similar
site
during
translation
of
the
TMEV
genome
.

In
addition
,
we
demonstrate
that
a
predicted
3=
RNA
stem-loop
structure
at
a
noncanonical
spacing
downstream
of
the
shift
site
is
required
for
efficient
frameshifting
in
TMEV
and
that
frameshifting
also
requires
virus
infection
.

Mutating
the
G_GUU_UUU
shift
site
to
inhibit
frameshifting
results
in
an
attenuated
virus
with
reduced
growth
kinetics
and
a
small-plaque
phenotype
.

Frameshifting
in
the
virus
context
was
found
to
be
extremely
efficient
at
74
to
82
%
,
which
,
to
our
knowledge
,
is
the
highest
frameshifting
efficiency
recorded
to
date
for
any
virus
.

We
propose
that
highly
efficient
؊1
PRF
in
TMEV
provides
a
mechanism
to
escape
the
confines
of
equimolar
expression

inherent
in
the
single-polyprotein
expression
strategy
of

With

PRF

on

heptanucleotide

Here
we
describe
an
unusual
case
of
؊1
PRF
in
Theiler
's
murine
encephalomyelitis
virus
(
TMEV
)

is
extraordinarily
efficient
(

82
%

into
the
alternative

)
and
,
in
stark
contrast
to
other
examples
of
؊1
PRF
,
is
dependent
upon
a
stem-loop
structure
beginning
14
nt
downstream
of

.

Furthermore
,
in
TMEV-based
reporter
constructs
in
transfected
cells
,
efficient
frameshifting
is
critically
dependent
upon
virus
infection
.

We
suggest
that
TMEV
evolved
frameshifting
as
a
novel
mechanism
for
removing
ribosomes
from
the
message
(
a

Background
.

Flaviviridae
viruses
are
single-stranded
,
positive-sense
RNA
viruses
,
which
threat
human
constantly
mediated
by
mosquitoes
,
ticks
,
and
sandflies
.

Considering
the
recent
increase
in
the
prevalence
of
the
family
virus
and
its
risk
potential
,
we
investigated
the
codon
usage
pattern
to
understand
its
evolutionary
processes
and
provide
some
useful
data
to
develop
the
medications
for
most
of
Flaviviridae
viruses
.

Results
.

The
overall
extent
of
codon
usage
bias
in
65
Flaviviridae
viruses
is
low
with
the
average
value
of
GC
contents
being
50.5
%
and
the
highest
value
being
55.9
%
;
the
lowest
value
is
40.2
%
.

ENC
values
of
Flaviviridae
virus
genes
vary
from
48.75
to
57.83
with
a
mean
value
of
55.56
.

U-and
A-ended
codons
are
preferred
in
the
Flaviviridae
virus
.

Correlation
analysis
shows
that
the
positive
correlation
between
ENC
value
and
GC
content
at
the
third
nucleotide
positions
was
significant
in
this
family
virus
.

The
result
of
analysis
of
ENC
,
neutrality
plot
analysis
,
and
correlation
analysis
revealed
that
codon
usage
bias
of
all
the
viruses
was
affected
mainly
by
natural
selection
.

Meanwhile
,
according
to
correspondence
analysis
(
CoA
)
based
on
RSCU
and
phylogenetic
analysis
,
the
Flaviviridae
viruses
mainly
are
made
up
of
two
groups
,
Group
I
(
Yellow
fever
virus
,
Apoi
virus
,
Tembusu
virus
,
Dengue
virus
1
,
and
others
)
and
Group
II
(
West
Nile
virus
lineage
2
,
Japanese
encephalitis
virus
,
Usutu
virus
,
Kedougou
virus
,
and
others
)
.

Conclusions
.

All
in
,
the
bias
of
codon
usage
pattern
is
affected
not
only
by
compositional
constraints
but
also
by
natural
selection
.

Phylogenetic
analysis
also
illustrates
that
codon
usage
bias
of
virus
can
serve
as
an
effective
means
of
evolutionary
classification
in
Flaviviridae
virus
.

The
family
Potyviridae
encompasses~30
%
of
plant
viruses
and
is
responsible
for
significant
economic
losses
worldwide
.

Recently
,
a
small
overlapping
coding
sequence
,
termed
pipo
,
was
found
to
be
conserved
in
the
genomes
of
all
potyvirids
.

PIPO
is
expressed
as
part
of
a
frameshift
protein
,
P3N-PIPO
,
which
is
essential
for
virus
cell-to-cell
movement
.

However
,
the
frameshift
expression
mechanism
has
hitherto
remained
unknown
.

Here
,
we
demonstrate
that
transcriptional
slippage
,
specific
to
the
viral
RNA
polymerase
,
results
in
a
population
of
transcripts
with
an
additional
``
A
''
inserted
within
a
highly
conserved
GAAAAAA
sequence
,
thus
enabling
expression
of
P3N-PIPO
.

The
slippage
efficiency
is~2
%
in
Turnip
mosaic
virus
and
slippage
is
inhibited
by
mutations
in
the
GAAAAAA
sequence
.

While
utilization
of
transcriptional
slippage
is
well
known
in
negative-sense
RNA
viruses
such
as
Ebola
,
mumps
and
measles
,
to
our
knowledge
this
is
the
first
report
of
its
widespread
utilization
for
gene
expression
in
positive-sense
RNA
viruses
.

in
Namibia
is
unique
and
found
in
such
magnitude
as
has
not
been
reported
elsewhere
in
southern
Africa
.

Reasons
as
to
why
Kudus
appear
to
be
exceptionally
susceptible
to
rabies
still
remain
speculative
at
best
.

Because
the
current
severe
rabies
endemic
in
Kudus
continues
to
have
an
enormous
negative
impact
on
the
Namibian
agricultural
sector
,
we
set
out
to
question
existing
dogmas
regarding
the
epidemiology
of
the
disease
in
a
unique
experimental
setting
.

In
addition
,
we
explored
effective
measures
to
protect
these
antelopes
.

Although
we
were
able
to
confirm
high
susceptibly
of
kudus
for
rabies
and
sporadic
horizontal
rabies
virus
transmission
to
contact
animals
,
we
contend
that
these
observations
can
not
plausibly
explain
the
rapid
spread
of
the
disease
in
Kudus
over
large
territories
.

Since
parenteral
vaccination
of
free-roaming
Kudus
is
virtually
impossible
,
oral
rabies
vaccination
using
modified
life
virus
vaccines
with
a
high
safety
profile
would
be
the
ultimate
solution
to
the
problem
.

In
a
proof-of-concept
study
using
a
3rd
generation
oral
rabies
virus
vaccine
construct
(
SPBN
GASGAS
)
we
found
evidence
that
Kudus
can
be
vaccinated
by
the
oral
route
and
protected
against
a
subsequent
rabies
infection
.

In
a
second
phase
,
more
targeted
studies
need
to
be
initiated
by
focusing
on
optimizing
oral
vaccine
uptake
and
delivery
.

Purpose
To
determine
causes
of
variability
in
communicable
disease
prevalence
rates
among
students
in
secondary
schools
to
inform
policy
formulation
in
the
public
health
sector
.

Methods
A
representative
cluster
sample
size
for
students
was
estimated
using
Fisher
et
al
.

's
formula
while
schools
,
sub-counties
and
education
zones
were
clustered
and
sample
size
was
calculated
based
on
coefficient
of
variation
by
school
type
.

Data
were
collected
by
questionnaire
,
medical
examination
using
standard
procedures
,
and
focus
group
discussion
,
and
descriptive
analysis
was
performed
on
the
completed
questions
.

Comparisons
between
risk
factors
were
made
by
chi-square
and
ANOVA
analysis
using
SPSS
for
Windows
(

software
.

A
p
value
of
<

was
considered
statistically
significant
.

Results
There
was
significant

prevalence
rates
and
age
(

.

However
,
there
was
no
significant
association
in
prevalence
rates
between
both
locality
and
type
of
school
.

There
was
strong
evidence
that
student
age
has
an
effect
on
prevalence
rates
.

The
prevalence
rate
of
malaria
was
higher
in
male
(
14.02
%
)
than
female
students
(
6.68
%
)
compared
to
prevalence
of
diarrhea
,
which
was
higher
in
female
(
7.96
%
)
than
male
students
.

Conclusion
This
study
has
revealed
that
the
prevalences
of
diarrhea
,
tuberculosis
,
pneumonia
and
other
respiratory
tract
infections
are
lower
among
female
secondary
school
students
than
males
and
that
the
prevalence
of
malaria
is
higher
in
males
than
females
.

Age

Different
vaccination
programs
using
imported
vaccines
have
failed
to
protect
the
flocks
from
field
challenge
.

Recent
studies
confirmed
a
successful
protection
using
homologous
strains
as
live
attenuated
vaccines
.

In
this
study
,
a
newly
developed
live
attenuated
IB-VAR2
vaccine
representing
the
GI-23
Middle
East
IBV
lineage
was
evaluated
in
day-old
commercial
broilers
in
an
IBV-endemic
area
.

A
commercial
broiler
flock
was
vaccinated
with
the
IB-VAR2
vaccine
at
day-old
age
followed
by
IB-H120
at
day
16
.

The
vaccinated
flock
was
monitored
on
a
weekly
basis
till
the
slaughter
age
.

The
health
status
and
growth
performance
were
monitored
,
and
selected
viral
pathogen
real-time
RT-PCR
(
rRT-PCR
)
detection
was
conducted
on
a
weekly
basis
.

Finally
,
the
flock
was
compared
to
a
nearby
farm
with
only
the
classical
IB-H120
vaccination
program
.

Results
showed
that
the
IB-VAR2
vaccine
was
tolerable
in
day-old
broiler
chicks
.

The
IBV
virus
rRT-PCR
detection
was
limited
to
the
trachea
as
compared
to
its
nephropathogenic
parent
virus
.

Respiratory
disease
problems
and
high
mortalities
were
reported
in
the
IB-H120-only
vaccinated
flock
.

An
exposure
to
a
wild-type
Egy/VarII
strain
was
confirmed
in
both
flocks
as
indicated
by
partial
IBV
S1
gene
sequence
.

Even
though
the
IB-VAR2-vaccinated
flock
performance
was
better
than
the
flock
that
received
only
IB-H120
,
the
IBV
ELISA
(
enzyme-linked
immunosorbent
assay
)
and
log2
Haemagglutination
inhibition
(
HI
)
antibody
mean
titers
remained
high
(
3128
±
2713
and
≥9
log2
,
respectively
)
until
the
28th
day
of
age
.

The
current
study
demonstrates
the
safety
and
effectiveness
of
IB-VAR2
as
a
live
attenuated
vaccine
in
day-old
commercial
broilers
.

Also
,
the
combination
of
IB-VAR2
and
classical
IBV
vaccines
confers
a
broader
protective
immune
response
against
IBV

from
three
provinces

.

The
most

)
corresponded
to
individuals
living
on

,
followed
by

)
and
animal
health
workers
(

noticeable
time

Southeast
Asia
is
considered
a
'hotspot
'
for
emerging
infectious
diseases
.

Over
recent
years
this
region
(
including
southeast
China
)
has
witnessed
the
emergence
of
major
outbreaks
of
severe
zoonotic
disease
such
as
SARS
,
nipah
virus
and
avian
influenza
1,2
.

The
region
has
a
higher
than
average
proportion
of
mortality
due
to
communicable
diseases
including
many
zoonoses
,
antimicrobial-resistant
pathogens
and
vector-borne
diseases

and
remains
an
epicentre
of
highly
pathogenic
avian
influenza
(
HPAI
)

.

The
reasons
for
this
high
incidence
of
emerging
zoonoses
in
southeast
Asia
are
complex
,
and
likely
to
include
multiple
demographic
,
geographical
,
climatic
,
economic
and
cultural
factors
as
well
as
agricultural
practices
that
create
an
environment

the
emergence
and

VIZIONS
(
Vietnam
Initiative
on
Zoonotic
InfectIONS
)
is
a
multidisciplinary
project
aiming
to
understand
the
emergence
of
zoonotic
viral
pathogens
in
human
populations
6
.

VIZIONS
is
performing
in-depth
comparisons
of
viromes
on
both
sides
of
the
species
barrier
(
i.e
.

humans
and
animals
)
with
concurrent
investigation
of
the
behavioural
and
demographic
factors
driving
pathogen
transmission
and
disease
emergence
.

VIZIONS
has
two
distinct
components
,
one
hospital-and
one
community-based
.

The
hospital-based
component
aims
to
identify
pathogens
that
have
already
crossed
the
species
barrier
causing
serious
infections
requiring
hospitalization
.

The
community
component
,
termed
'
a
high-risk
sentinel
cohort
'
(
HRSC
)
,
focuses
on
individuals
perceived
to
be
at
particularly
high
risk
of
infection
with
zoonotic
pathogens
because
of
their
occupational
or
residential
exposure
6
.

These
cohorts
include
people
living
on
farms
(
including
farms
raising
non-domestic
or
'exotic
species
'
-termed
'exotic
animal
farms
'
)
,
slaughterers
(
pigs
and
poultry
)
,
animal
health
workers
,
restaurant
workers
and
rat
traders
.

Farmers
represent
the
most
common
population
subgroup
,
since
68
%
of
the
Vietnamese
population
is
rural
(
GSO
,
2013
)
,
and
small-scale
animal
farming
represents
a
common
source
of
livelihood
in
rural
settings
.

The
HRSC
studies
primarily
aim
at
detecting
viruses
involved
in
episodes
of
milder
disease
(
i.e
.

not
requiring
hospitalization
)
by
simultaneous
co-sampling
of
humans
and
animals
as
close
as
possible
to
the
date
of
onset
of
disease
and
characterize
the
major
risks
associated
with
exposure
to
animals
and
consumption
of
animal
food
.

Sampling
in
the
HSRC
and
hospital
components
overlap
in
space
and
time
to
ensure
that
pathogens
discovered
in
one
study
population
can
be
investigated
in
the
other
.

Recruitment
for
the
VIZIONS
HRSC
was
initiated
in
March
2013
,
and
by
September
2014
HRSC
studies
were
established
in
three
provinces
of
Vietnam
(
Dong
Thap
,
Ha
Noi
and
Dak
Lak
)
,
all
with
differing
human
and
geographical
landscapes
(
the
Mekong
Delta
,
the
Red
River

,
the
Central
Highlands
,
respectively
)
.

The
aims
of
this
report
are
:
(
a
)
To
describe
the
methodologies
used
for
recruitment
of
HRSC
members
and
associated
data
collection
;
(
b
)
to
describe
the
demographic
characteristics
and
high-risk
exposures
(
i.e
.

contact
with
animals
,
slaughtering
and
consumption
)
among
the
HRSC
members
across
the
three
provinces
;
and
(
c
)
to
provide
a
current
update
report
on
the
episodes
of
clinical
disease
reported
.

Human
metapneumovirus
(
hMPV
)
is
a
leading
cause
of
lower
respiratory
infection
in
pediatric
populations
globally
.

This
study
examined
proteomic
profile
changes
in
A549
cells
infected
with
hMPV
and
two
attenuated
mutants
with
deleted
PDZ
domain-binding
motif
(
s
)
in
the
M2-2
protein
.

These
motifs
are
involved
in
the
interruption
of
antiviral
signaling
,
namely
the
interaction
between
the
TNF
receptor
associated
factor
(
TRAF
)
and
mitochondrial
antiviral-signaling
(
MAVS
)
proteins
.

The
aim
of
this
study
was
to
provide
insight
into
the
overall
and
novel
impact
of
M2-2
motifs
on
cellular
responses
via
an
unbiased
comparison
.

Tandem
mass
tagging
,
stable
isotope
labeling
,
and
high-resolution
mass
spectrometry
were
used
for
quantitative
proteomic
analysis
.

Using
quantitative
proteomics
and
Venn
analysis
,
1248
common
proteins
were
detected
in
all
infected
samples
of
both
technical
sets
.

Hierarchical
clustering
of
the
differentiated
proteome
displayed
distinct
proteomic
signatures
that
were
controlled
by
the
motif
(
s
)
.

Bioinformatics
and
experimental
analysis
confirmed
the
differentiated
proteomes
,
revealed
novel
cellular
biological
events
,
and
implicated
key
pathways
controlled
by
hMPV
M2-2
PDZ
domain-binding
motif
(
s
)
.

This
provides
further
insight
for
evaluating
M2-2
mutants
as
potent
vaccine
candidates
.

Low
cost
,
high
throughput
,
easy
quantitation
,
and
rich
descriptions
have
made
gene
expression
profiling
generated
by
DNA
microarrays
an
optimal
approach
for
describing
host
transcriptional
responses
(
HTRs
)
.

However
,
efforts
to
characterize
the
landscape
of
HTRs
to
diverse
pathogens
are
far
from
offering
a
comprehensive
view
.

Here
,
we
developed
an
HTR
Connectivity
Map
based
on
systematic
assessment
of
pairwise
similarities
of
HTRs
to
50
clinically
important
human
pathogens
using
1353
gene-expression
profiles
generated
from
>
60
human
cells/tissues
.

These
50
pathogens
were
further
partitioned
into
eight
robust
``
HTR
communities
''
(
i.e.
,
groups
with
more
consensus
internal
HTR
similarities
)
.

These
communities
showed
enrichment
in
specific
infection
attributes
and
differential
gene
expression
patterns
.

Using
query
signatures
of
HTRs
to
external
pathogens
,
we
demonstrated
four
distinct
modes
of
HTR
associations
among
different
pathogens
types/class
,
and
validated
the
reliability
of
the
HTR
community
divisions
for
differentiating
and
categorizing
pathogens
from
a
host-oriented
perspective
.

These
findings
provide
a
first-generation
HTR
Connectivity
Map
of
50
diverse
pathogens
,
and
demonstrate
the
potential
for
using
annotated
HTR
community
to
detect
functional
associations
among
infectious
pathogens
.

As
infectious
disease
outbreaks
emerge
,
public
health
agencies
often
enact
vaccination
and
social
distancing
measures
to
slow
transmission
.

Their
success
depends
on
not
only
strategies
and
resources
,
but
also
public
adherence
.

Individual
willingness
to
take
precautions
may
be
influenced
by
global
factors
,
such
as
news
media
,
or
local
factors
,
such
as
infected
family
members
or
friends
.

Here
,
we
compare
three
modes
of
epidemiological
decisionmaking
in
the
midst
of
a
growing
outbreak
using
network-based
mathematical
models
that
capture
plausible
heterogeneity
in
human
contact
patterns
.

Individuals
decide
whether
to
adopt
a
recommended
intervention
based
on
overall
disease
prevalence
,
the
proportion
of
social
contacts
infected
,
or
the
number
of
social
contacts
infected
.

While
all
strategies
can
substantially
mitigate
transmission
,
vaccinating
(
or
self
isolating
)
based
on
the
number
of
infected
acquaintances
is
expected
to
prevent
the
most
infections
while
requiring
the
fewest
intervention
resources
.

Unlike
the
other
strategies
,
it
has
a
substantial
herd
effect

providing
indirect
protection

a
large
fraction

As
outbreaks
unfold
,
people
can
take
a
variety
precautionary
measures
to
avoid
infection
,
including
immunization
and
social
distancing

When
infection
risk
appears
low
,
small
risks
of
adverse
effects
from
the
vaccine
can
seem
relatively
important
and
cause
vaccine
coverage
to
drop
below
levels
required
to
control
transmission

A
variety
of
other
factors

the
perceived
utility

epidemiological
news

Studies
have
shown
that
media
reports
about
outbreaks
that
specify
numbers
of
cases
,
hospitalizations
or
deaths
,
can
influence
avoidance
behavior
and
contact
patterns
at
both
individual
and
community
levels
.

In
some
cases
,
oversimplified
or
erroneous
media
reports
regarding
flawed
vaccines
can
trigger
panic
and
increases
in
vaccine
hesitancy

For
both
seasonal
and
pandemic
influenza
,
such
interactions
between
vaccination
decision-making
and
transmission
dynamics
can
profoundly
shape
the
course
of
epidemics
[
20
,
[
34
]
[
35
]
[
36
]
.

Individual
intervention
decisions
can
have
far-reaching
effects
.

For
example
,
vaccination
protects
not
only
the
immunized
individual
,
but
also
social
contacts
who
might
have
been
infected
by
the
individual
.

Social
distancing
decisions
may
break
chains
of
transmission
by
protecting
the
decision-maker
and
more
generally
disrupting
social
dynamics
.

Following
[
37
,
38
]
,
we
refer
to
this
indirect
protection
as
a
herd
effect
.

Although
previously
equated
to
the
reduction
in
incidence
in
the
unimmunized
population
[
38
]
,
we
quantify
the
herd
effect
of
an
intervention
effort
by
estimating
the
number
of
infections
averted
per
vaccine
administered
(
or
per
individual
social
distancing
action
)
.

The
general
phenomenon
in
which
individual
intervention
actions
reduce
the
risk
of
infection
to
others
has
also
been
called
vaccination
efficiency
,
vaccination
effectiveness
,
herd
immunity
,
and
indirect
protection
[
37
]
[
38
]
[
39
]
[
40
]
.

The
magnitude
of
the
herd
effect
will
critically
depend
on
contact
patterns
[
41
,
42
]
.

Measures
taken
by
gregarious
individuals
may
have
greater
immediate
benefits
than
those
taken
by
solitary
individuals
,
with
downstream
epidemiological
consequences
modulated
by
the
full
social
network
[
43
,
44
]
.

Contact
patterns
may
also
influence
the
decision-making
process
itself
,
by
constraining
epidemiological
perspectives
.

When
gauging
infection
risk
,
individuals
may
consider
global
information
(
e.g.
,
from
news
media
)
or
local
first-hand
encounters
with
disease
(
e.g.
,
infected
acquaintances
,
friends
or
family
members
)
[
30
,
31
]
.

While
traditional
compartmental
models
assume
homogeneity
in
both
epidemiological
risks
and
intervention
benefits
,
network-based
models
provide
a
tractable
framework
for
studying
the
complex
interplay
between
contact
networks
,
intervention
decision
making
and
disease
transmission

Here
,
we
investigate
the
epidemiological
impacts
of
different
decision
paradigms
using
a
network-based
SIR
epidemic
model

As

,
separation
and
quantification
of
the
specific

from
the
chiral
compounds
in

are
becoming
more
important
.

To
clarify
the
chemical
characterization
of
chiral
glucosinolates-the
antiviral
active
ingredients
of
Radix
Isatidis
,
an
optimized
efficient
method
of
HPLC-UV-CD
was
developed
to
simultaneously
separate
and
quantify
the
four
main
chiral
glucosinolates
:
progoitrin
,
epiprogoitrin
,
and
R
,
S-goitrin
.

The
first
step
was
to
determine
progoitrin
,
epiprogoitrin
,
and
R
,
S-goitrin
using
HPLC-UV
,
and
then
determine
the
R-goitrin
and
S-goitrin
by
coupling
with
CD
detection
.

Subsequently
,
through
the
linear
relations
between
anisotropy
factor
(
g
factor
)
and
the
percent
optical
purity
of
R-goitrin
,
the
contents
of
R-goitrin
and
S-goitrin
from
the
R
,
S-goitrin
mixture
were
calculated
separately
.

Furthermore
,
the
chemical
composition
features
of
the
four
chiral
glucosinolates
in
37
samples
from
crude
drugs
,
decoction
pieces
,
and
granules
of
R.
Isatidis
were
conducted
.

The
total
content
of
the
four
glucosinolates
was
obviously
higher
in
crude
drugs
,
and
the
variance
character
of
each
glucosinolate
contents
was
different
.

In
summary
,
the
accurate
measurement
method
reported
here
allows
for
better
control
of
the
internal
quality
of

We
developed
a

screening
method
to
monitor
NTCP

on
the
cell
surface
by
generating
a

tetracycline-inducible
expression

a
monoclonal
antibody
that
specifically
detects

Using

We
found
that
glabridin
,
a
licorice-derived
isoflavane
,
could
suppress

infection
by
inducing
caveolar
endocytosis

NTCP
with
an
IC

We
also
found
that
glabridin
could
attenuate
the

effect

signaling

depleting

Our

the

Biomolecular
mass
spectrometry
has
matured
strongly
over
the
past
decades
and
has
now
reached
a
stage
where
it
can
provide
deep
insights
into
the
structure
and
composition
of
large
cellular
assemblies
.

Here
,
we
describe
a
three-tiered
hybrid
mass
spectrometry
approach
that
enables
the
dissection
of
macromolecular
complexes
in
order
to
complement
structural
studies
.

To
demonstrate
the
capabilities
of
the
approach
,
we
investigate
ribosomes
,
large
ribonucleoprotein
particles
consisting
of
a
multitude
of
protein
and
RNA
subunits
.

We
identify
sites
of
sequence
processing
,
protein
post-translational
modifications
,
and
the
assembly
and
stoichiometry
of
individual
ribosomal
proteins
in
four
distinct
ribosomal
particles
of
bacterial
,
plant
and
human
origin
.

Amongst
others
,
we
report
extensive
cysteine
methylation
in
the
zinc
finger
domain
of
the
human
S27
protein
,
the
heptameric
stoichiometry
of
the
chloroplastic
stalk
complex
,
the
heterogeneous
composition
of
human
40S
ribosomal
subunits
and
their
association
to
the
CrPV
,
and
HCV
internal
ribosome
entry
site
RNAs
.

Background
:
Tumor
necrosis
factor
(
TNF
)
and
TNF
receptor
superfamily
(
TNFR
)
-mediated
immune
response
play
an
essential
role
in
the
pathogenesis
of
severe
sepsis
.

Studies
examining
associations
of
TNF
and
lymphotoxin-a
(
LTA
)
single
nucleotide
polymorphisms
(
SNPs
)
with
severe
sepsis
have
produced
conflicting
results
.

The
objective
of
this
study
was
to
investigate
whether
genetic
variation
in
TNF
,
LTA
,
TNFRSF1A
and
TNFRSF1B
was
associated
with
susceptibility
to
or
death
from
severe
sepsis
in
Chinese
Han
population
.

Methodology/Principal
Findings
:
Ten
SNPs
in
TNF
,
LTA
,
TNFRSF1A
and
TNFRSF1B
were
genotyped
in
samples
of
patients
with
severe
sepsis
(
n
=
432
)
,
sepsis
(
n
=
384
)
and
healthy
controls
(
n
=
624
)
.

Our
results
showed
that
rs1800629
,
a
SNP
in
the
promoter
region
of
TNF
,
was
significantly
associated
with
risk
for
severe
sepsis
.

The
minor
allele
frequency
of
rs1800629
was
significantly
higher
in
severe
sepsis
patients
than
that
in
both
healthy
controls
(
P
adj
=
0.00046
,
odds
ratio
(
OR
)
adj
=
1.92
)
and
sepsis
patients
(
P
adj
=
0.002
,
OR
adj
=
1.56
)
.

Further
,
we
investigated
the
correlation
between
rs1800629
genotypes
and
TNF-a
concentrations
in
peripheral
blood
mononuclear
cells
(
PBMCs
)
of
healthy
volunteers
exposed
to
lipopolysaccharides
(
LPS
)
ex
vivo
,
and
the
association
between
rs1800629
and
TNF-a
serum
levels
in
severe
sepsis
patients
.

After
exposure
to
LPS
,
the
TNF-a
concentration
in
culture
supernatants
of
PBMCs
was
significantly
higher
in
the
subjects
with
AA+AG
genotypes
than
that
with
GG
genotype
(
P
=
0.007
)
.

Moreover
,
in
patients
with
severe
sepsis
,
individuals
with
AA+AG
genotypes
had
significantly
higher
TNF-a
serum
concentrations
than
those
with
GG
genotype
(
P
adj
=
0.02
)
.

However
,
there
were
no
significant
associations
between
SNPs
in
the
four
candidate
genes
and
30
day
mortality
for
patients
with
severe
sepsis
.

Conclusions/Significance
:
Our
findings
suggested
that
the
functional
TNF
gene
SNP
rs1800629
was
strongly
associated
with
susceptibility
to
severe
sepsis
,
but
not
with
lethality
in
Chinese
Han
population
.

Background
:
Acute
respiratory
illness
is
the
leading
cause
of
asthma
exacerbations
yet
the
mechanisms
underlying
this
association
remain
unclear
.

To
address
the
deficiencies
in
our
understanding
of
the
molecular
events
characterizing
acute
respiratory
illness-induced
asthma
exacerbations
,
we
undertook
a
transcriptional
profiling
study
of
the
nasal
mucosa
over
the
course
of
acute
respiratory
illness
amongst
individuals
with
a
history
of
asthma
,
allergic
rhinitis
and
no
underlying
respiratory
disease
.

Methods
:
Transcriptional
profiling
experiments
were
performed
using
the
Agilent
Whole
Human
Genome
4X44K
array
platform
.

Time
point-based
microarray
and
principal
component
analyses
were
conducted
to
identify
and
distinguish
acute
respiratory
illness-associated
transcriptional
profiles
over
the
course
of
our
study
.

Gene
enrichment
analysis
was
conducted
to
identify
biological
processes
over-represented
within
each
acute
respiratory
illness-associated
profile
,
and
gene
expression
was
subsequently
confirmed
by
quantitative
polymerase
chain
reaction
.

Modified
mRNA
(
modRNA
)
is
a
gene
delivery
platform
for
transiently
introducing
single
or
several
gene/s
of
interest
to
different
cell
types
and
tissues
.

modRNA
consider
to
be
a
safe
vector
for
gene
transfer
as
it
negligibly
activate
the
innate
immune
system
and
dose
not
compromise
the
genome
integrity
.

The
use
of
modRNA
in
basic
and
translational
science
is
rising
,
due
to
the
clinical
potential
of
modRNA
.

We
are
currently
using
modRNA
to
induce
cardiac
regeneration
post-ischemic
injury
.

Major
obstacles
in
using
modRNA
for
cardiac
ischemic
disease
include
the
need
for
the
direct
and
single
administration
of
modRNA
to
the
heart
and
the
inefficient
translation
of
modRNA
due
to
its
short
half-life
.

Modulation
of
5′
untranslated
regions
(
5′UTR
)
to
enhance
translation
efficiency
in
ischemic
cardiac
disease
has
great
value
as
it
can
reduce
the
amount
of
modRNA
needed
per
delivery
and
will
achieve
higher
and
longer
protein
production
post
single
delivery
.

Here
,
we
identified
that
5′UTR
from
the
fatty
acid
metabolism
gene
carboxylesterase
1D
(
Ces1d
)
enhanced
the
translation
of
Luc
modRNA
by
2
fold
in
the
heart
post
MI
.

Moreover
,
we
identified
,
in
the
Ces1d
,
a
specific
RNA
element
(
element
D
)
that
is
responsible
for
the
improvement
of
modRNA
translation
,
and
leads
to
a
2.5
fold
translation
increment
over
Luc
modRNA
carrying
artificial
5'UTR
,
post
MI
.

Importantly
,
we
were
able
to
show
that
5′UTR
Ces1d
also
enhances
modRNA
translation
in
the
liver
,
but
not
in
the
kidney
,
post-ischemic
injury
.

Indicating
that
Ces1d
5'UTR
and
Element
D
may
play
a
wider
role
in
translation
of
protein
under
ischemic
condition
.

Bovine
rhinitis
viruses
(
BRV
)
are
established
etiological
agents
of
bovine
respiratory
disease
complex
however
little
research
into
their
epidemiology
and
ecology
has
been
published
for
several
decades
.

In
the
U.S.
,
only
bovine
rhinitis
A
virus
1
(
BRAV1
)
has
been
identified
while
bovine
rhinitis
A
virus
2
(
BRAV2
)
and
bovine
rhinitis
B
virus
(
BRBV
)
were
previously
only
identified
in
England
and
Japan
,
respectively
.

Metagenomic
sequencing
of
a
nasal
swab
from
a
bovine
respiratory
disease
(
BRD
)
diagnostic
submission
from
Kansas
identified
contigs
with
approximately
90
%
nucleotide
similarity
to
BRAV2
and
BRBV
.

A
combination
of
de
novo
and
templated
assemblies
using
reference
genomes
yielded
near
complete
BRAV2
and
BRBV
genomes
.

The
near
complete
genome
of
bovine
rhinitis
A
virus
1
(
BRAV1
)
was
also
determined
from
a
historical
isolate
to
enable
further
molecular
epidemiological
studies
.

A
5'-nuclease
reverse
transcription
PCR
assay
targeting
the
3D
polymerase
gene
was
designed
and
used
to
screen
204
archived
BRD
clinical
specimens
.

Thirteen
(
6.4
%
)
were
positive
.

Metagenomic
sequencing
of
six
positive
samples
identified
mixed
BRAV1/BRAV2
,
BRAV1/BRBV
and
BRAV2/BRBV
infections
for
five
samples
.

One
sample
showed
infection
only
with
BRAV1
.

Seroprevalence
studies
using
a
cell
culture
adapted
BRBV
found
immunofluorescence
assay-reactive
antibodies
were
common
in
the
herds
analyzed
.

Altogether
,
these
results
demonstrate
that
BRV
infections
are
common
in
cattle
with
respiratory
disease
and
that
BRAV1
,
BRAV2
and
BRBV
co-circulate
in
U.S.
cattle
and
have
high
similarity
to
viruses
isolated
more
than
30
years
ago
from
diverse
locations
.

We
propose
rational
designing
of
antiviral
short-interfering
RNA
(
siRNA
)
targeting
highly
divergent
HIV-1
.

In
this
study
,
conserved
regions
within
HIV-1
genomes
were
identified
through
an
exhaustive
computational
analysis
,
and
the
functionality
of
siRNAs
targeting
the
highest
possible
conserved
regions
was
validated
.

We
present
several
promising
antiviral
siRNA
candidates
that
effectively
inhibited
multiple
subtypes
of
HIV-1
by
targeting
the
best
conserved
regions
in
pandemic
HIV-1
group
M
strains
.

Background
:
Canine
Kobuvirus
(
CaKoV
)
has
been
detected
both
in
healthy
and
diarrheic
dogs
and
in
asymptomatic
wild
carnivores
.

In
this
study
,
we
conducted
a
survey
of
CaKoV
at
small
animal
hospitals
in
Bangkok
and
vicinity
of
Thailand
during
September
2016
to
September
2018
.

Results
:
Three
hundred
and
seven
rectal
swab
samples
were
collected
from
healthy
dogs
(
n
=
55
)
and
dogs
with
gastroenteritis
symptoms
(
n
=
252
)
.

Of
307
swab
samples
tested
by
using
one-step
RT-PCR
specific
to
3D
gene
,
we
found
CaKoV
positivity
at
17.59
%
(
54/307
)
.

CaKoVs
could
be
detected
in
both
sick
(
19.44
%
)
and
healthy
(
9.09
%
)
animals
.

In
relation
to
age
group
,
CaKoV
could
be
frequently
detected
in
younger
dogs
(
25.45
%
)
.

Our
result
showed
no
seasonal
pattern
of
CaKoV
infection
in
domestic
dogs
.

In
this
study
,
we
characterized
CaKoVs
by
whole
genome
sequencing
(
n
=
4
)
or
3D
and
VP1
gene
sequencing
(
n
=
8
)
.

Genetic
and
phylogenetic
analyses
showed
that
whole
genomes
of
Thai
CaKoVs
were
closely
related
to
Chinese
CaKoVs
with
highest
99.5
%
amino
acid
identity
suggesting
possible
origin
of
CaKoVs
in
Thailand
.

Conclusions
:
In
conclusion
,
this
study
was
the
first
to
report
the
detection
and
genetic
characteristics
of
CaKoVs
in
domestic
dogs
in
Thailand
.

CaKoVs
could
be
detected
in
both
sick
and
healthy
dogs
.

The
virus
is
frequently
detected
in
younger
dogs
.

Thai
CaKoVs
were
genetically
closely
related
and
grouped
with
Chinese
CaKoVs
.

Our
result
raises
the
concerns
to
vet
practitioners
that
diarrhea
in
dogs
due
to
canine
Kobuvirus
infection
should
not
be
ignored
.

Viroporins
are
small
hydrophobic
viral
proteins
that
oligomerize
to
form
aqueous
pores
on
cellular
membranes
.

Studies
in
recent
years
have
demonstrated
that
viroporins
serve
important
functions
during
virus
replication
and
contribute
to
viral
pathogenicity
.

A
number
of
viroporins
have
also
been
shown
to
localize
to
the
endoplasmic
reticulum
(
ER
)
and/or
its
associated
membranous
organelles
.

In
fact
,
replication
of
most
RNA
viruses
is
closely
linked
to
the
ER
,
and
has
been
found
to
cause
ER
stress
in
the
infected
cells
.

On
the
other
hand
,
autophagy
is
an
evolutionarily
conserved
``
self-eating
''
mechanism
that
is
also
observed
in
cells
infected
with
RNA
viruses
.

Both
ER
stress
and
autophagy
are
also
known
to
modulate
a
wide
variety
of
signaling
pathways
including
pro-inflammatory
and
innate
immune
response
,
thereby
constituting
a
major
aspect
of
host-virus
interactions
.

In
this
review
,
the
potential
involvement
of
viroporins
in
virus-induced
ER
stress
and
autophagy
will
be
discussed
.

We
have
shown
previously
that
replacement
of
the
spike
(
S
)
gene
of
the
apathogenic
IBV
strain
Beau-R
with
that
from
the
pathogenic
strain
of
the
same
serotype
,
M41
,
resulted
in
an
apathogenic
virus
,
BeauR-M41
(
S
)
,
that
conferred
protection
against
challenge
with
M41
[

]
.

We
have
constructed
a
recombinant
IBV
,
BeauR-4/91
(
S
)
,
with
the
genetic
backbone
of
Beau-R
but
expressing
the
spike
protein
of
the
pathogenic
IBV
strain
4/91
(
UK
)
,
which
belongs
to
a
different
serogroup
as
Beaudette
or
M41
.

Similar
to
our
previous
findings
with
BeauR-M41
(
S
)
,
clinical
signs
observations
showed
that
the
S
gene
of
the
pathogenic
4/91
virus
did
not
confer
pathogenicity
to
the
rIBV
BeauR-4/91
(
S
)
.

Furthermore
,
protection
studies
showed
there
was
homologous
protection
;
BeauR-4/91
(
S
)
conferred
protection
against
challenge
with
wild
type
4/91
virus
as
shown
by
the
absence
of
clinical
signs
,
IBV
RNA
assessed
by
qRT-PCR
and
the
fact
that
no
virus
was
isolated
from
tracheas
removed
from
birds
primarily
infected
with
BeauR-4/91
(
S
)
and
challenged
with
IBV
4/91
(
UK
)
.

A
degree
of
heterologous
protection
against
M41
challenge
was
observed
,
albeit
at
a
lower
level
.

Our
results
confirm
and
extend
our
previous
findings
and
conclusions
that
swapping
of
the
ectodomain
of
the
S
protein
is
a
precise
and
effective
way
of
generating
genetically
defined
candidate
IBV
vaccines
.

Most
recently
a
novel
avian-origin
influenza
A
(
H7N9
)
virus
emerged
in
China
and
has
been
associated
with
lots
of
human
infection
and
fatal
cases
.

Genetic
analysis
of
the
viral
genome
revealed
that
this
reassortant
virus
might
be
better
adapted
to
humans
than
other
avian
influenza
viruses
.

Molecular
diagnostic
methods
are
thus
urgently
needed
in
public
health
laboratories
.

In
this
study
,
a
SYBR
green-based
one-step
real
time
reverse
transcription-PCR
(
RT-PCR
)
was
developed
to
detect
the
novel
H7N9
virus
.

The
primer
pairs
on
the
basis
of
the
hemagglutinin
and
neuraminidase
gene
sequences
of
H7N9
viruses
amplified
subtype-specific
fragments
with
Tm
values
of
80.7760.06uC
for
H7
and
81.2060.17uC
for
N9
respectively
.

The
standard
curves
showed
a
dynamic
linear
range
across
6
log
units
of
RNA
copy
number
(
10
6
to
10
1
copies/
ml
)
with
a
detection
limit
of
10
copies
per
reaction
for
both
H7
and
N9
assays
by
using
serial
ten-fold
diluted
in-vitro
transcribed
viral
RNA
.

In
addition
,
no
cross-reactivity
was
observed
with
seasonal
H1N1
,
H1N1
pdm09
,
H3N2
,
H5N1
and
H9N2
viruses
as
well
as
other
human
respiratory
viruses
.

When
the
assay
was
further
evaluated
in
H7N9
virus
infected
clinical
samples
,
positive
amplification
signals
were
obtained
in
all
of
the
specimens
with
the
accordance
between
H7
and
N9
assays
.

Therefore
,
the
established
SYBR
green-based
real
time
RT-PCR
assay
could
provide
a
rapid
,
sensitive
,
specific
and
reliable
alternative
approach
with
lower
costs
for
high
throughput
screening
of
suspected
samples
from
humans
,
animals
and
environments
in
first
line
public
health
laboratories

Coronaviruses
infect
a
variety
of
mammalian
and
avian
species
and
cause
serious
diseases
in
humans
,
cats
,
mice
,
and
birds
in
the
form
of
severe
acute
respiratory
syndrome
(
SARS
)
,
feline
infectious
peritonitis
(
FIP
)
,
mouse
hepatitis
,
and
avian
infectious
bronchitis
,
respectively
.

No
effective
vaccine
or
treatment
has
been
developed
for
SARScoronavirus
or
FIP
virus
,
both
of
which
cause
lethal
diseases
.

It
has
been
reported
that
a
cyclophilin
inhibitor
,
cyclosporin
A
(
CsA
)
,
could
inhibit
the
replication
of
coronaviruses
.

CsA
is
a
well-known
immunosuppressive
drug
that
binds
to
cellular
cyclophilins
to
inhibit
calcineurin
,
a
calcium-calmodulin-activated
serine/threonine-specific
phosphatase
.

The
inhibition
of
calcineurin
blocks
the
translocation
of
nuclear
factor
of
activated
T
cells
from
the
cytosol
into
the
nucleus
,
thus
preventing
the
transcription
of
genes
encoding
cytokines
such
as
interleukin-2
.

Cyclophilins
are
peptidyl-prolyl
isomerases
with
physiological
functions
that
have
been
described
for
many
years
to
include
chaperone
and
foldase
activities
.

Also
,
many
viruses
require
cyclophilins
for
replication
;
these
include
human
immunodeficiency
virus
,
vesicular
stomatitis
virus
,
and
hepatitis
C
virus
.

However
,
the
molecular
mechanisms
leading
to
the
suppression
of
viral
replication
differ
for
different
viruses
.

This
review
describes
the
suppressive
effects
of
CsA
on
coronavirus
replication
.

The
origin
of
tannins
,
their
historical
evolution
,
their
different
types
,
and
their
applications
are
described
.

Old
and
established
applications
are
described
,
as
well
as
the
future
applications
which
are
being
developed
at
present
and
that
promise
to
have
an
industrial
impact
in
the
future
.

The
chemistry
of
some
of
these
applications
is
discussed
where
it
is
essential
to
understand
the
tannins
and
their
derivates
role
.

The
essential
points
of
each
application
,
their
drawbacks
,
and
their
chance
of
industrial
application
are
briefly
discussed
.

The
article
presents
historical
applications
of
tannins
,
such
as
leather
,
or
traditional
medicine
,
and
more
recent
applications
.

We
present
two
probabilistic
models
to
estimate
the
risk
of
introducing
infectious
diseases
into
previously
unaffected
countries/regions
by
infective
travellers
.

We
analyse
two
distinct
situations
,
one
dealing
with
a
directly
transmitted
infection
(
measles
in
Italy
in
2017
)
and
one
dealing
with
a
vector-borne
infection
(
Zika
virus
in
Rio
de
Janeiro
,
which
may
happen
in
the
future
)
.

To
calculate
the
risk
in
the
first
scenario
,
we
used
a
simple
,
nonhomogeneous
birth
process
.

The
second
model
proposed
in
this
paper
provides
a
way
to
calculate
the
probability
that
local
mosquitoes
become
infected
by
the
arrival
of
a
single
infective
traveller
during
his/her
infectiousness
period
.

The
result
of
the
risk
of
measles
invasion
of
Italy
was
of
93
%
and
the
result
of
the
risk
of
Zika
virus
invasion
of
Rio
de
Janeiro
was
of
22
%
.

To
determine
the
incidence
of
anogenital
warts
(
AGWs
)
in
the
Chinese
general
population
,
we
compared
the
data
from
a
prospective
study
and
from
the
National
Notifiable
Disease
Report
System
(
NNDRS
)
.

A
cohort
study
including
2378
women
and
2309
men
aged
18-55
years
old
enrolled
from
Liuzhou
,
China
,
was
conducted
with
three
scheduled
visits
at
6-month
intervals
from
May
2014
to
March
2016
.

And
,
a
questionnaire
survey
was
performed
to
collect
the
diagnosis
history
of
AGWs
at
the
enrollment
visit
.

The
data
on
reported
AGW
cases
of
Liuzhou
in
the
NNDRS
from
2006
to
2015
were
also
analyzed
.

Overall
,
the
incidence
rates
of
AGWs
in
the
prospective
study
,
in
the
self-reported
diagnosis
during
past
12
months
and
in
the

)
,
2.35
(

1.17-4.20
)
and
0.183
(

,
respectively
.

Human

6
or
11
were
found
in
all
the
AGW
biopsy
samples
(
10/10
)
.

The
onset
time
of
AGWs
in
women
was
earlier
,
and
the
cumulative
risk
increased
more
quickly
at
a
young
age
along
with
each
subsequent
younger
birth
cohort
(
Po0.0001
)
,
whereas
slight
differences
were
observed
in
the
different
male
birth
cohorts
(
P
=
0.0785
)
.

The
sexual
behavior
of
individuals
and
their
sexual
partners
had
a
strong
relationship
with
self-reported
AGWs
.

Our
study
indicates
that
the
incidence
of
AGWs
in
China
is
as
high
as
that
in
developed
countries
,
and
the
data
based
on
the
national
surveillance
system
seriously
underestimate
the
real
disease
burden
of
AGWs

Guinea
fowl
coronavirus
(
GfCoV
)
causes
fulminating
enteritis
that
can
result
in
a
daily
death
rate
of
20
%
in
guinea
fowl
flocks
.

Here
,
we
studied
GfCoV
diversity
and
evaluated
its
phenotypic
consequences
.

Over
the
period
of
2014
to
2016
,
affected
guinea
fowl
flocks
were
sampled
in
France
,
and
avian
coronavirus
presence
was
confirmed
by
PCR
on
intestinal
content
and
immunohistochemistry
of
intestinal
tissue
.

Sequencing
revealed
89
%
amino
acid
identity
between
the
viral
attachment
protein
S1
of
GfCoV/2014
and
that
of
the
previously
identified
GfCoV/2011
.

To
study
the
receptor
interactions
as
a
determinant
for
tropism
and
pathogenicity
,
recombinant
S1
proteins
were
produced
and
analyzed
by
glycan
and
tissue
arrays
.

Glycan
array
analysis
revealed
that
,
in
addition
to
the
previously
elucidated
biantennary
di-N-acetyllactosamine
(
diLacNAc
)
receptor
,
viral
attachment
S1
proteins
from
GfCoV/
2014
and
GfCoV/2011
can
bind
to
glycans
capped
with
alpha-2,6-linked
sialic
acids
.

Interestingly
,
recombinant
GfCoV/2014
S1
has
an
increased
affinity
for
these
glycans
compared
to
that
of
GfCoV/2011
S1
,
which
was
in
agreement
with
the
increased
avidity
of
GfCoV/2014
S1
for
gastrointestinal
tract
tissues
.

Enzymatic
removal
of
receptors
from
tissues
before
application
of
spike
proteins
confirmed
the
specificity
of
S1
tissue
binding
.

Overall
,
we
demonstrate
that
diversity
in
GfCoV
S1
proteins
results
in
differences
in
glycan
and
tissue
binding
properties
.

IMPORTANCE
Avian
coronaviruses
cause
major
global
problems
in
the
poultry
industry
.

As
causative
agents
of
huge
economic
losses
,
the
detection
and
understanding
of
the
molecular
determinants
of
viral
tropism
are
of
ultimate
importance
.

Here
,
we
set
out
to
study
those
parameters
and
obtained
in-depth
insight
into
the
virushost
interactions
of
guinea
fowl
coronavirus
(
GfCoV
)
.

Our
data
indicate
that
diversity
in
GfCoV
viral
attachment
proteins
results
in
differences
in
degrees
of
affinity
for
glycan
receptors
,
as
well
as
altered
avidity
for
intestinal
tract
tissues
,
which
might
have
consequences
for
GfCoV
tissue
tropism
and
pathogenesis
in
guinea
fowls
.

The
type
II
transmembrane
serine
proteases
TMPRSS2
and
HAT
activate
influenza
viruses
and
the
SARS-coronavirus
(
TMPRSS2
)
in
cell
culture
and
may
play
an
important
role
in
viral
spread
and
pathogenesis
in
the
infected
host
.

However
,
it
is
at
present
largely
unclear
to
what
extent
these
proteases
are
expressed
in
viral
target
cells
in
human
tissues
.

Here
,
we
show
that
both
HAT
and
TMPRSS2
are
coexpressed
with
2,6-linked
sialic
acids
,
the
major
receptor
determinant
of
human
influenza
viruses
,
throughout
the
human
respiratory
tract
.

Similarly
,
coexpression
of
ACE2
,
the
SARS-coronavirus
receptor
,
and
TMPRSS2
was
frequently
found
in
the
upper
and
lower
aerodigestive
tract
,
with
the
exception
of
the
vocal
folds
,
epiglottis
and
trachea
.

Finally
,
activation
of
influenza
virus
was
conserved
between
human
,
avian
and
porcine
TMPRSS2
,
suggesting
that
this
protease
might
activate
influenza
virus
in
reservoir-
,
intermediate-and
human
hosts
.

In
sum
,
our
results
show
that
TMPRSS2
and
HAT
are
expressed
by
important
influenza
and
SARS-coronavirus
target
cells
and
could
thus
support
viral
spread
in
the
human
host
.

Viral
variants
that
arise
in
the
global
influenza
population
begin
as
de
novo
mutations
in
single
infected
hosts
,
but
the
evolutionary
dynamics
that
transform
within-host
variation
to
global
genetic
diversity
are
poorly
understood
.

Here
,
we
demonstrate
that
influenza
evolution
within
infected
humans
recapitulates
many
evolutionary
dynamics
observed
at
the
global
scale
.

We
deep-sequence
longitudinal
samples
from
four
immunocompromised
patients
with
long-term
H3N2
influenza
infections
.

We
find
parallel
evolution
across
three
scales
:
within
individual
patients
,
in
different
patients
in
our
study
,
and
in
the
global
influenza
population

The
Florida
manatee
(
Trichechus

is
a
threatened
aquatic
mammal
in
United
States
coastal
waters
.

Over
the
past
decade
,
the
appearance
of
papillomavirusinduced
lesions
and
viral
papillomatosis
in
manatees
has
been
a
concern
for
those
involved
in
the
management
and
rehabilitation
of
this
species
.

To
date
,
three
manatee
papillomaviruses
(
TmPVs
)
have
been
identified
in
Florida
manatees
,
one
forming
cutaneous
lesions
(
TmPV1
)
and
two
forming
genital
lesions
(
TmPV3
and
TmPV4
)
.

We
identified
DNA
sequences
with
the
potential
to
form
G-quadruplex
structures
(
G4
)
across
the
three
genomes
.

G4
were
located
on
both
DNA
strands
and
across
coding
and
non-coding
regions
on
all
TmPVs
,
offering
multiple
targets
for
viral
control
.

Although
G4
have
been
identified
in
several
viral
genomes
,
including
human
PVs
,
most
research
has
focused
on
canonical
structures
comprised
of
three
Gtetrads
.

In
contrast
,
the
vast
majority
of
sequences
we
identified
would
allow
the
formation
of
non-canonical
structures
with
only
two
G-tetrads
.

Our
biophysical
analysis
confirmed
the
formation
of
G4
with
parallel
topology
in
three
such
sequences
from
the
E2
region
.

Two
of
the
structures
appear
comprised
of
multiple
stacked
two
G-tetrad
structures
,
perhaps
serving
to
increase
structural
stability
.

Computational
analysis
demonstrated
enrichment
of
G4
sequences
on
all
TmPVs
on
the
reverse
strand
in
the
E2/E4
region
and
on
both
strands
in
the
L2
region
.

Several
G4
sequences
occurred
at
similar
regional
locations
on
all
PVs
,
most
notably
on
the
reverse
strand
in
the
E2
region
.

In
other
cases
,
G4
were
identified
at
similar
regional
locations
only
on
PVs
forming
genital
lesions
.

On
all
TmPVs
,
G4
sequences
were
located
in
the
non-coding
region
near
putative
E2
binding
sites
.

Together
,
these
findings
suggest
that
G4
are
possible
regulatory
elements

There
is
great
interest
in
the
development
of
Ab-inducing
subunit
vaccines
targeting
infections
,
including
HIV
,
malaria
,
and
Ebola
.

We
previously
reported
that
adenovirus
vectored
vaccines
are
potent
in
priming
Ab
responses
,
but
uncertainty
remains
regarding
the
optimal
approach
for
induction
of
humoral
immune
responses
.

In
this
study
,
using

we
assessed
the

of

to
four
clinically

We
then
used

cytometric
assays
capable
of
measuring
total

Ag-specific
germinal

responses
to
compare
the
induction
of
these

by

We
report
that

induce
Ag
insert-specific
GC
B
cell
and
Ab
responses
of
a
magnitude
comparable
to
those
induced
by
a
potent
protein/squalene
oil-in-water
formulation
whereas-despite
a
robust
overall
GC
response-the
insert-specific
GC
B
cell
and
Ab
responses
induced
by
modified
vaccinia
Ankara
were
extremely
weak
.

Ag-specific
follicular
Th
cell
responses
to
adenovirus
vectored
vaccines
exceeded
those
induced
by
other
platforms
at
day
7
after
immunization
.

We
found
little
evidence
that
innate
immune
activation
by
adenovirus
may
act
as
an
adjuvant
in
such
a
manner
that
the
humoral
response
to
a
recombinant
protein
may
be
enhanced
by
coadministering
with
an
adenovirus
lacking
a
transgene
of
interest
.

Overall
,
these
studies
provide
further
support
for
the
use
of
replication-deficient
adenoviruses
to
induce
humoral

To
identify
new
host
factors
that
modulate
the
replication
of
influenza
A
virus
,
we
performed
a
yeast
two-hybrid
screen
using
the
cytoplasmic
tail
of
matrix
protein
2
from
the
highly
pathogenic
H5N1
strain
.

The
screen
revealed
a
high-score
interaction
with
cyclin
D3
,
a
key
regulator
of
cell
cycle
early
G
1
phase
.

Interestingly
,
the
increase
in
virus
production
was
due
to
cyclin
D3
deficiency
per
se
and
not
merely
a
consequence
of
cell
cycle
deregulation
.

A
combined
knockdown
of
Ccnd3
and
Rb1
,
which
rescued
cell
cycle
progression
into
S
phase
,
failed
to
normalize
virus
production
.

Infection
by
influenza
A
virus
triggered
redistribution
of
cyclin
D3
from
the
nucleus
to
the
cytoplasm
,
followed
by
its
proteasomal
degradation
.

When
overexpressed
in
HEK
293T
cells
,
cyclin
D3
impaired
binding
of
M2
with
M1
,
which
is
essential
for
proper
assembly
of
progeny
virions
,
lending
further
support
to
its
role
as
a
putative
restriction
factor
.

Our
study
describes
the
identification
and
characterization
of
cyclin
D3
as
a
novel
interactor
of
influenza
A
virus
M2
protein
.

We
hypothesize
that
competitive
inhibition
of
M1-M2
interaction
by
cyclin
D3
impairs
infectious
virion
formation
and
results
in
attenuated
virus
production
.

In
addition
,
we
provide
mechanistic
insights
into
the
dynamic
interplay
of
influenza
virus
with
the
host
cell
cycle
machinery
during
infection
.

Viral
protein
synthesis
is
completely
dependent
upon
the
host
cell
's
translational
machinery
.

Canonical
translation
of
host
mRNAs
depends
on
structural
elements
such
as
the
5
′
cap
structure
and/or
the
3
′
poly
(
A
)
tail
of
the
mRNAs
.

Although
many
viral
mRNAs
are
devoid
of
one
or
both
of
these
structures
,
they
can
still
translate
efficiently
using
non-canonical
mechanisms
.

Here
,
we
review
the
tools
utilized
by
positive-sense
single-stranded
(
+ss
)
RNA
plant
viruses
to
initiate
non-canonical
translation
,
focusing
on
cis-acting
sequences
present
in
viral
mRNAs
.

We
highlight
how
these
elements
may
interact
with
host
translation
factors
and
speculate
on
their
contribution
for
achieving
translational
control
.

We
also
describe
other
translation
strategies
used
by
plant
viruses
to
optimize
the
usage
of
the
coding
capacity
of
their
very
compact
genomes
,
including
leaky
scanning
initiation
,
ribosomal
frameshifting
and
stop-codon
readthrough
.

Finally
,
future
research
perspectives
on
the
unusual
translational
strategies
of
+ssRNA
viruses
are
discussed
,
including
parallelisms
between
viral
and
host
mRNAs
mechanisms
of
translation
,
particularly
for
host
mRNAs
which
are
translated
under
stress
conditions
.

Major
gaps
in
our
knowledge
of
pathogen
genes
and
how
these
gene
products
interact
with
host
gene
products
to
cause
disease
represent
a
major
obstacle
to
progress
in
vaccine
and
antiviral
drug
development
for
the
herpesviruses
.

To
begin
to
bridge
these
gaps
,
we
conducted
a
dual
analysis
of
Murine
Cytomegalovirus
(
MCMV
)
and
host
cell
transcriptomes
during
lytic
infection
.

We
analyzed
the
MCMV
transcriptome
during
lytic
infection
using
both
classical
cDNA
cloning
and
sequencing
of
viral
transcripts
and
next
generation
sequencing
of
transcripts
(
RNA-Seq
)
.

We
also
investigated
the
host
transcriptome
using
RNA-Seq
combined
with
differential
gene
expression
analysis
,
biological
pathway
analysis
,
and
gene
ontology
analysis
.

We
identify
numerous
novel
spliced
and
unspliced
transcripts
of
MCMV
.

Unexpectedly
,
the
most
abundantly
transcribed
viral
genes
are
of
unknown
function
.

We
found
that
the
most
abundant
viral
transcript
,
recently
identified
as
a
noncoding
RNA
regulating
cellular
microRNAs
,
also
codes
for
a
novel
protein
.

To
our
knowledge
,
this
is
the
first
viral
transcript
that
functions
both
as
a
noncoding
RNA
and
an
mRNA
.

We
also
report
that
lytic
infection
elicits
a
profound
cellular
response
in
fibroblasts
.

Highly
upregulated
and
induced
host
genes
included
those
involved
in
inflammation
and
immunity
,
but
also
many
unexpected
transcription
factors
and
host
genes
related
to
development
and
differentiation
.

Many
top
downregulated
and
repressed
genes
are
associated
with
functions
whose
roles
in
infection
are
obscure
,
including
host
long
intergenic
noncoding
RNAs
,
antisense
RNAs
or
small
nucleolar
RNAs
.

Correspondingly
,
many
differentially
expressed
genes
cluster
in
biological
pathways
that
may
shed
new
light
on
cytomegalovirus
pathogenesis
.

Together
,
these
findings
provide
new
insights
into
the
molecular
warfare
at
the
virus-host
interface
and
suggest
new
areas
of
research
to
advance
the
understanding
and
treatment
of
cytomegalovirus-associated
diseases
.

in
China

.

Moreover
,

,
these

In

and
is
adjacent
to
several
South-eastern
Asia
countries
.

Therefore
,
it
is
necessary
to
know
whether
WENV-related
viruses
,
or
other
mammarenaviruses
,
are
prevalent
in
this
province
.

Small

were
trapped
,
euthanized
,
and

.

Mammarenavirus

was
detected
using
a
nested
reverse
transcription
polymerase
chain
reaction
(
RT-PCR
)
and
quantified
by
real-time

A
total

1040
small

belonging
to
13
genera
and
26
species
were
trapped
in
Yunnan

WENV-related

were
detected
in
41

in

Whole

showed
that
these

Bronchiectasis

a
disease
associated
with
chronic
progressive

irreversible
dilatation
of
the
bronchi
and
is
characterised
by
chronic

and

.

The
prevalence
of
bronchiectasis
is
age-related
and
there
is
some
geographical
variation
in
incidence
,

and
clinical
features
.

Most
bronchiectasis

idiopathic
however
post-infectious
aetiologies
dominate
across
Asia
especially
secondary

Most

on
the

of

Modern

have
become
invaluable
tools

which

These

provided
important
insight
into
our

Further
,

Despite
flaviviruses
remaining
the
leading
cause
of
systemic
human
infections
worldwide
,
ocular
manifestations
of
these
mosquito-transmitted
viruses
are
considered
relatively
uncommon
in
part
due
to
under-reporting
.

However
,
recent
outbreaks
of
Zika
virus
(
ZIKV
)
implicated
in
causing
multiple
ocular
abnormalities
,
such
as
conjunctivitis
,
retinal
hemorrhages
,
chorioretinal
atrophy
,
posterior
uveitis
,
optic
neuritis
,
and
maculopathies
,
has
rejuvenated
a
significant
interest
in
understanding
the
pathogenesis
of
flaviviruses
,
including
ZIKV
,
in
the
eye
.

In
this
review
,
first
,
we
summarize
the
current
knowledge
of
the
major
flaviviruses
(
Dengue
,
West
Nile
,
Yellow
Fever
,
and
Japanese
Encephalitis
)
reported
to
cause
ocular
manifestations
in
humans
with
emphasis
on
recent
ZIKV
outbreaks
.

Second
,
being
an
immune
privilege
organ
,
the
eye
is
protected
from
systemic
infections
by
the
presence
of
blood-retinal
barriers
(
BRB
)
.

Hence
,
we
discuss
how
flaviviruses
modulate
retinal
innate
response
and
breach
the
protective
BRB
to
cause
ocular
or
retinal
pathology
.

Finally
,
we
describe
recently
identified
infection
signatures
of
ZIKV
and
discuss
whether
these
system
biology-predicted
genes
or
signaling
pathways
(
e.g.
,
cellular
metabolism
)
could
contribute
to
the
pathogenesis
of
ocular
manifestations
and
assist
in
the
development
of
ocular
antiviral
therapies
against
ZIKV
and
other
flaviviruses

Influenza
A
virus
(
IAV
)
contains
a
segmented
negative-strand
RNA
genome
.

How
IAV
balances
the
replication
and
transcription
of
its
multiple
genome
segments
is
not
understood
.

We
developed
a
dual
competition
assay
based
on
the
cotransfection
of
firefly
or
Gaussia
luciferase-encoding
genome
segments
together
with
plasmids
encoding
IAV
polymerase
subunits
and
nucleoprotein
.

At
limiting
amounts
of
polymerase
subunits
,
expression
of
the
firefly
luciferase
segment
was
negatively
affected
by
the
presence
of
its
Gaussia
luciferase
counterpart
,
indicative
of
competition
between
reporter
genome
segments
.

This
competition
could
be
relieved
by
increasing
or
decreasing
the
relative
amounts
of
firefly
or
Gaussia
reporter
segment
,
respectively
.

The
balance
between
the
luciferase
expression
levels
was
also
affected
by
the
identity
of
the
untranslated
regions
(
UTRs
)
as
well
as
segment
length
.

In
general
it
appeared
that
genome
segments
displaying
inherent
higher
expression
levels
were
more
efficient
competitors
of
another
segment
.

When
natural
genome
segments
were
tested
for
their
ability
to
suppress
reporter
gene
expression
,
shorter
genome
segments
generally
reduced
firefly
luciferase
expression
to
a
larger
extent
,
with
the
M
and
NS
segments
having
the
largest
effect
.

The
balance
between
different
reporter
segments
was
most
dramatically
affected
by
the
introduction
of
UTR
panhandle-stabilizing
mutations
.

Furthermore
,
only
reporter
genome
segments
carrying
these
mutations
were
able
to
efficiently
compete
with
the
natural
genome
segments
in
infected
cells
.

Our
data
indicate
that
IAV
genome
segments
compete
for
available
polymerases
.

Competition
is
affected
by
segment
length
,
coding
region
,
and
UTRs
.

This
competition
is
probably
most
apparent
early
during
infection
,
when
limiting
amounts
of
polymerases
are
present
,
and
may
contribute
to
the
regulation
of
segment-specific
replication
and
transcription

Viruses
replicate
inside
the
cells
of
an
organism
and
continuously
evolve
to
contend
with
an
ever-changing
environment
.

Many
life-threatening
diseases
,
such
as
AIDS
,
SARS
,
hepatitis
and
some
cancers
,
are
caused
by
viruses
.

Because
viruses
have
small
genome
sizes
and
high
mutability
,
there
is
currently
a
lack
of
and
an
urgent
need
for
effective
treatment
for
many
viral
pathogens
.

One
approach
that
has
recently
received
much
attention
is
aptamer-based
therapeutics
.

Aptamer
technology
has
high
target
specificity
and
versatility
,
i.e.
,
any
viral
proteins
could
potentially
be
targeted
.

Consequently
,
new
aptamer-based
therapeutics
have
the
potential
to
lead
a
revolution
in
the
development
of
anti-infective
drugs
.

Additionally
,
aptamers
can
potentially
bind
any
targets
and
any
pathogen
that
is
theoretically
amenable
to
rapid
targeting
,
making
aptamers
invaluable
tools
for
treating
a
wide
range
of
diseases
.

This
review
will
provide
a
broad
,
comprehensive
overview
of
viral
therapies
that
use
aptamers
.

The
aptamer
selection
process
will
be
described
,
followed
by
an
explanation
of
the
potential
for
treating
virus
infection
by
aptamers
.

Gold
nanoparticles
(
GNPs
)
have
been
widely
utilized
to
develop
various
biosensors
for
molecular
diagnosis
,
as
they
can
be
easily
functionalized
and
exhibit
unique
optical
properties
explained
by
plasmonic
effects
.

These
unique
optical
properties
of
GNPs
allow
the
expression
of
an
intense
color
under
light
that
can
be
tuned
by
altering
their
size
,
shape
,
composition
,
and
coupling
with
other
plasmonic
nanoparticles
.

Additionally
,
they
can
also
enhance
other
optical
signals
,
such
as
fluorescence
and
Raman
scattering
,
making
them
suitable
for
biosensor
development
.

In
this
review
,
we
provide
a
detailed
discussion
of
the
currently
developed
biosensors
based
on
the
aforementioned
unique
optical
features
of
GNPs
.

Mainly
,
we
focus
on
four
different
plasmonic
biosensing
methods
,
including
localized
surface
plasmon
resonance
(
LSPR
)
,
surface-enhanced
Raman
spectroscopy
(
SERS
)
,
fluorescence
enhancement
,
and
quenching
caused
by
plasmon
and
colorimetry
changes
based
on
the
coupling
of
GNPs
.

We
believe
that
the
topics
discussed
here
are
useful
and
able
to
provide
a
guideline
in
the
development
of
novel
GNP-based
biosensors

Positive-sense
single-stranded
RNA
viruses
form
the
largest
and
most
diverse
group
of
eukaryote-infecting
viruses
.

Their
genomes
comprise
one
or
more
segments
of
coding-sense
RNA
that
function
directly
as
messenger
RNAs
upon
release
into
the
cytoplasm
of
infected
cells
.

Positive-sense
RNA
viruses
are
generally
accepted
to
encode
proteins
solely
on
the
positive
strand
.

However
,
we
previously
identified
a
surprisingly
long
(
$
1,000-codon
)
open
reading
frame
(
ORF
)
on
the
negative
strand
of
some
members
of
the
family
Narnaviridae
which
,
together
with
RNA
bacteriophages
of
the
family
Leviviridae
,
form
a
sister
group
to
all
other
positive-sense
RNA
viruses
.

Here
,
we
completed
the
genomes
of
three
mosquito-associated
narnaviruses
,
all
of
which
have
the
long
reverse-frame
ORF
.

We
systematically
identified
narnaviral
sequences
in
public
data
sets
from
a
wide
range
of
sources
,
including
arthropod
,
fungal
,
and
plant
transcriptomic
data
sets
.

Long
reverse-frame
ORFs
are
widespread
in
one
clade
of
narnaviruses
,
where
they
frequently
occupy
>
95
per
cent
of
the
genome
.

The
reverseframe
ORFs
correspond
to
a
specific
avoidance
of
CUA
,
UUA
,
and
UCA
codons
(
i.e
.

stop
codon
reverse
complements
)
in
the
forward-frame
RNA-dependent
RNA
polymerase
ORF
.

However
,
absence
of
these
codons
can
not
be
explained
by
other
factors
such
as
inability
to
decode
these
codons
or
GC3
bias
.

Together
with
other
analyses
,
we
provide
the
strongest
evidence
yet
of
coding
capacity
on
the
negative
strand
of
a
positive-sense
RNA
virus
.

As
these
ORFs
comprise
some
of
the
longest
known
overlapping
genes
,
their
study
may
be
of
broad
relevance
to
understanding
overlapping
gene
evolution
and
de
novo
origin
of
genes
.

Influenza
C
virus
,
a
member
of
the
Orthomyxoviridae
family
,
causes
flu-like
disease
but
typically
only
with
mild
symptoms
.

Humans
are
the
main
reservoir
of
the
virus
,
but
it
also
infects
pigs
and
dogs
.

Very
recently
,
influenza
C-like
viruses
were
isolated
from
pigs
and
cattle
that
differ
from
classical
influenza
C
virus
and
might
constitute
a
new
influenza
virus
genus
.

Influenza
C
virus
is
unique
since
it
contains
only
one
spike
protein
,
the
hemagglutinin-esterase-fusion
glycoprotein
HEF
that
possesses
receptor
binding
,
receptor
destroying
and
membrane
fusion
activities
,
thus
combining
the
functions
of
Hemagglutinin
(
HA
)
and
Neuraminidase
(
NA
)
of
influenza
A
and
B
viruses
.

Here
we
briefly
review
the
epidemiology
and
pathology
of
the
virus
and
the
morphology
of
virus
particles
and
their
genome
.

The
main
focus
is
on
the
structure
of
the
HEF
protein
as
well
as
on
its
co-and
posttranslational
modification
,
such
as
N-glycosylation
,
disulfide
bond
formation
,
S-acylation
and
proteolytic
cleavage
into
HEF1
and
HEF2
subunits
.

Finally
,
we
describe
the
functions
of
HEF
:
receptor
binding
,
esterase
activity
and
membrane
fusion
.

Background
:
Feline
morbillivirus
(
FmoPV
)
is
a
novel
paramyxovirus
found
to
infect
domestic
cats
.

FmoPV
has
been
isolated
in
several
countries
in
Asia
and
Europe
and
is
considered
to
have
genetic
diversity
.

Also
,
it
is
suspected
to
be
associated
with
feline
renal
diseases
including
tubulointerstitial
nephritis
(
TIN
)
,
which
affects
domestic
cats
with
a
high
incidence
rate
.

Results
:
To
clarify
the
state
of
FmoPV
infection
among
domestic
cats
in
Japan
,
an
epidemiological
survey
was
conducted
.

Twenty-one
out
of
100
cats
were
found
to
have
serum
antibodies
(
Ab
)
against
FmoPV-N
protein
by
indirect
immunofluorescence
assay
(
IF
)
using
FmoPV-N
protein-expressing
HeLa
cells
.

Twenty-two
of
the
cats
were
positive
for
FmoPV
RNA
in
the
urine
and/or
renal
tissues
.

In
total
,
29
cats
were
positive
for
Ab
and/or
viral
RNA
.

These
FmoPV-infected
cats
were
classified
into
three
different
phases
of
infection
:
RNA+/Ab
+
(
14
cats
)
,
RNA+/Ab-
(
8
cats
)
and
RNA-/Ab
+
(
7
cats
)
.

In
immunohistochemistry
(
IHC
)
,
19
out
of
29
cats
were
positive
for
FmoPV-N
protein
in
kidney
tissues
;
however
,
the
FmoPV-N
protein
was
located
in
the
inflammatory
lesions
with
severe
grade
in
only
four
out
of
the
19
cats
.

Since
15
out
of
29
infected
cats
were
positive
for
viral
RNA
and
Ab
,
approximately
half
of
the
infected
cats
were
persistently
infected
with
FmoPV
.

Conclusions
:
A
statistically
significant
difference
was
observed
between
infection
of
FmoPV
and
the
presence
of
inflammatory
changes
in
renal
lesions
,
indicating
a
relationship
between
FmoPV
infection
and
feline
renal
diseases
.

However
,
we
could
not
obtain
histopathological
evidence
of
a
relationship
between
FmoPV
infection
and
TIN
.

The
recognition
of
sialic
acids
by
two
strains
of
minute
virus
of
mice
(
MVM
)
,
MVMp
(
prototype
)
and
MVMi
(
immunosuppressive
)
,
is
an
essential
requirement
for
successful
infection
.

To
understand
the
potential
for
recognition
of
different
modifications
of
sialic
acid
by
MVM
,
three
types
of
capsids
,
virus-like
particles
,
wild
type
empty
(
no
DNA
)
capsids
,
and
DNA
packaged
virions
,
were
screened
on
a
sialylated
glycan
microarray
(
SGM
)
.

Both
viruses
demonstrated
a
preference
for
binding
to
9-O-methylated
sialic
acid
derivatives
,
while
MVMp
showed
additional
binding
to
9-O-acetylated
and
9-Olactoylated
sialic
acid
derivatives
,
indicating
recognition
differences
.

The
glycans
recognized
contained
a
type-2
Galb1-4GlcNAc
motif
(
Neu5Aca2-3Galb1-4GlcNAc
or
39SIA-LN
)
and
were
biantennary
complex-type
N-glycans
with
the
exception
of
one
.

To
correlate
the
recognition
of
the
39SIA-LN
glycan
motif
as
well
as
the
biantennary
structures
to
their
natural
expression
in
cell
lines
permissive
for
MVMp
,
MVMi
,
or
both
strains
,
the
N-and
O-glycans
,
and
polar
glycolipids
present
in
three
cell
lines
used
for
in
vitro
studies
,
A9
fibroblasts
,
EL4
T
lymphocytes
,
and
the
SV40
transformed
NB324K
cells
,
were
analyzed
by
MALDI-TOF/TOF
mass
spectrometry
.

The
cells
showed
an
abundance
of
the
sialylated
glycan
motifs
recognized
by
the
viruses
in
the
SGM
and
previous
glycan
microarrays
supporting
their
role
in
cellular
recognition
by
MVM
.

Significantly
,
the
NB324K
showed
fucosylation
at
the
non-reducing
end
of
their
biantennary
glycans
,
suggesting
that
recognition
of
these
cells
is
possibly
mediated
by
the
Lewis
X
motif
as
in
39SIA-Le
X
identified
in
a
previous
glycan
microarray
screen
.

Background
:
Novel
Muscovy
duck
reovirus
(
N-MDRV
)
,
emerged
in
southeast
China
in
2002
,
which
can
infect
a
wide
range
of
waterfowl
and
induces
clinical
signs
and
cytopathic
effects
that
are
distinct
from
those
of
classical
MDRV
,
and
continues
to
cause
high
morbidity
and
5-50
%
mortality
in
ducklings
.

The
present
study
aimed
to
investigate
the
characteristics
of
two
novel
reoviruses
isolated
from
Muscovy
ducklings
in
Guangdong
,
China
.

Results
:
Two
novel
MDRV
strains
,
designated
as
MDRV-SH12
and
MDRV-DH13
,
were
isolated
from
two
diseased
Muscovy
ducklings
in
Guangdong
province
,
China
in
June
2012
and
September
2013
,
respectively
.

Sequencing
of
the
complete
genomes
of
these
two
viruses
showed
that
they
consisted
of
23,418
bp
and
were
divided
into
10
segments
,
ranging
from
1191
bp
(
S4
)
to
3959
bp
(
L1
)
in
length
,
and
all
segments
contained
conserved
sequences
in
the
5′
non-coding
region
(
GCUUUU
)
and
3′
non-coding
region
(
UCAUC
)
.

Pairwise
sequence
comparisons
demonstrated
that
MDRV-SH12
and
MDRV-DH13
showed
the
highest
similarity
with
novel
MDRVs
.

Phylogenetic
analyses
of
the
nucleotide
sequences
of
all
10
segments
revealed
that
MDRV-SH12
and
MDRV-DH13
were
clustered
together
with
other
novel
waterfowl-origin
reoviruses
and
were
distinct
from
classical
waterfowl-origin
and
chickenorigin
reoviruses
.

The
analyses
also
showed
possible
genetic
re-assortment
events
in
segment
M2
between
waterfowl-origin
and
chicken-origin
reoviruses
and
the
segments
encoding
λA
,
μA
,
μNS
,
σA
,
and
σNS
between
classical
and
novel
waterfowl-origin
reoviruses
.

Potential
recombination
events
detection
in
segment
S2
suggests
that
MDRV-SH12
and
MDRV-DH13
may
be
recombinants
of
classical
and
novel
WRVs
.

The
results
presented
in
this
study
,
the
full
genomic
data
for
two
novel
MDRV
strains
,
will
improve
our
understanding
of
the
evolutionary
relationships
among
the
waterfowl-origin
reoviruses
circulating
in
China
,
and
may
aid
in
the
development
of
more
effective
vaccines
against
various
waterfowl-origin
reoviruses
.

Background
:
Overcrowding
,
reduced
nurse
to
patient
ratio
,
limited
distance
between
incubators
and
absence
of
microbiological
surveillance
have
been
shown
to
promote
spread
of
multidrug-resistant
gram-negative
organisms
(
MDRGN
)
in
patients
with
birthweight
<
1500
g.
Patients
>
1500
g
treated
on
an
intermediate
care
unit
are
unrepresented
in
recent
literature
.

We
therefore
intended
to
present
data
obtained
from
a
short-term
overcrowded
neonatal
intermediate
care
unit
(
NIMCU
)
at
a
level
III
(
international
categorization
)
perinatal
center
at
University
Hospital
Frankfurt
,
Germany
.

Methods
:
During
a
25
day
overcrowding
(
OV
)
and
28
day
post-overcrowding
period
(
POST-OV
)
on
NIMCU
,
epidemiological
data
obtained
from
continuously
hold
microbiological
surveillance
were
investigated
and
compared
to
the
last
12
months
of
ward-regular
bed
occupancy
preceding
OV
(
PRAE-OV
)
.

Results
:
During
OV
,
the
number
of
patients
simultaneously
treated
at
the
NIMCU
increased
from
18
to
22
,
resulting
in
a
reduced
bed-to-bed
space
.

Nurse
:
patient
ratio
was
4:22
during
OV
compared
to
3:18
during
PRAE-OV
.

Cumulative
incidence
of
MDRGN
was
4.7
%
in
OV
and
2.4
%
POST-OV
compared
to
4.8
%
to
PRAE-OV
,
respectively
,
without
any
significant
variations
.

During
OV
and
POST-OV
,
septic
episodes
due
to
MDRGN
were
not
observed
.

In
one
case
,
potential
nosocomial
transmission
of
Enterobacter
cloacae
resistant
to
Piperacillin
and
3rd/4th
generation
cephalosporins
was
observed
.

Conclusions
:
Prevention
of
nosocomial
spread
of
MDRGN
in
an
overcrowded
NIMCU
is
based
on
staff
's
diligent
training
and
adequate
staffing
.

Concise
microbiological
surveillance
should
be
guaranteed
to
escort
through
overcrowding
periods
.

In
our
setting
,
impact
of
bed-to-bed
distance
on
MDRGN
transmission
seemed
to
be
less
strong
.

Background
:
Cellular
stressors
and
apoptosis-inducing
agents
have
been
shown
to
induce
ribosomal
RNA
(
rRNA
)
degradation
in
eukaryotic
cells
.

Recently
,
RNA
degradation
in
vivo
was
observed
in
patients
with
locally
advanced
breast
cancer
,
where
mid-treatment
tumor
RNA
degradation
was
associated
with
complete
tumor
destruction
and
enhanced
patient
survival
.

However
,
it
is
not
clear
how
widespread
chemotherapy
induced
``
RNA
disruption
''
is
,
the
extent
to
which
it
is
associated
with
drug
response
or
what
the
underlying
mechanisms
are
.

Methods
:
Ovarian
(
A2780
,
CaOV3
)
and
breast
(
MDA-MB-231
,
MCF-7
,
BT474
,
SKBR3
)
cancer
cell
lines
were
treated
with
several
cytotoxic
chemotherapy
drugs
and
total
RNA
was
isolated
.

RNA
was
also
prepared
from
docetaxel
resistant
A2780DXL
and
carboplatin
resistant
A2780CBN
cells
following
drug
exposure
.

Disruption
of
RNA
was
analyzed
by
capillary
electrophoresis
.

Northern
blotting
was
performed
using
probes
complementary
to
the
28S
and
18S
rRNA
to
determine
the
origins
of
degradation
bands
.

Apoptosis
activation
was
assessed
by
flow
cytometric
monitoring
of
annexin-V
and
propidium
iodide
(
PI
)
binding
to
cells
and
by
measuring
caspase-3
activation
.

The
link
between
apoptosis
and
RNA
degradation
(
disruption
)
was
investigated
using
a
caspase-3
inhibitor
.

Results
:
All
chemotherapy
drugs
tested
were
capable
of
inducing
similar
RNA
disruption
patterns
.

Docetaxel
treatment
of
the
resistant
A2780DXL
cells
and
carboplatin
treatment
of
the
A2780CBN
cells
did
not
result
in
RNA
disruption
.

Northern
blotting
indicated
that
two
RNA
disruption
bands
were
derived
from
the
3'-end
of
the
28S
rRNA
.

Annexin-V
and
PI
staining
of
docetaxel
treated
cells
,
along
with
assessment
of
caspase-3
activation
,
showed
concurrent
initiation
of
apoptosis
and
RNA
disruption
,
while
inhibition
of
caspase-3
activity
significantly
reduced
RNA
disruption
.

Conclusions
:
Supporting
the
in
vivo
evidence
,
our
results
demonstrate
that
RNA
disruption
is
induced
by
multiple
chemotherapy
agents
in
cell
lines
from
different
tissues
and
is
associated
with
drug
response
.

Although
present
,
the
link
between
apoptosis
and
RNA
disruption
is
not
completely
understood
.

Evaluation
of
RNA
disruption
is
thus
proposed
as
a
novel
and
effective
biomarker
to
assess
response
to
chemotherapy
drugs
in
vitro
and
in
vivo
.
