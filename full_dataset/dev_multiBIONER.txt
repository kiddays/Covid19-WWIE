Because
so
few
viruses
in
the
family
Barnaviridae
have
been
reported
,
we
searched
for
more
of
them
in
public
sequence
databases
.

Here
,
we
report
the
complete
coding
sequence
of
Colobanthus
quitensis
associated
barnavirus
1
,
mined
from
a
transcriptome
of
the
Antarctic
pearlwort
Colobanthus
quitensis
.

The
4.2-kb
plus-strand
sequence
of
this
virus
encompasses
four
main
open
reading
frames
(
ORFs
)
,
as
expected
for
barnaviruses
,
including
ORFs
for
a
protease-containing
polyprotein
,
an
RNA-dependent
RNA
polymerase
whose
translation
appears
to
rely
on
−
1
ribosomal
frameshifting
,
and
a
capsid
protein
that
is
likely
to
be
translated
from
a
subgenomic
RNA
.

The
possible
derivation
of
this
virus
from
a
fungus
associated
with
C.
quitensis
is
discussed
.

Attenuated
,
live
viral
vaccines
have
been
extraordinarily
successful
in
protecting
against
many
diseases
.

The
main
drawbacks
in
their
development
and
use
have
been
reliance
on
an
unpredictable
method
of
attenuation
and
the
potential
for
evolutionary
reversion
to
high
virulence
.

Methods
of
genetic
engineering
now
provide
many
safer
alternatives
to
live
vaccines
,
so
if
live
vaccines
are
to
compete
with
these
alternatives
in
the
future
,
they
must
either
have
superior
immunogenicity
or
they
must
be
able
to
overcome
these
former
disadvantages
.

Several
live
vaccine
designs
that
were
historically
inaccessible
are
now
feasible
because
of
advances
in
genome
synthesis
.

Some
of
those
methods
are
addressed
here
,
with
an
emphasis
on
whether
they
enable
predictable
levels
of
attenuation
and
whether
they
are
stable
against
evolutionary
reversion
.

These
new
designs
overcome
many
of
the
former
drawbacks
and
position
live
vaccines
to
be
competitive
with
alternatives
.

Not
only
do
new
methods
appear
to
retard
evolutionary
reversion
enough
to
prevent
vaccine-derived
epidemics
,
but
it
may
even
be
possible
to
permanently
attenuate
live
vaccines
that
are
transmissible
but
can
not
evolve
to
higher
virulence
under
prolonged
adaptation
.

The
recent
outbreak
of
H7N9
influenza
in
China
is
of
high
concern
to
public
health
.

H7
hemagglutinin
(
HA
)
plays
a
critical
role
in
influenza
entry
and
thus
HA
presents
an
attractive
target
for
antivirals
.

Previous
studies
have
suggested
that
the
small
molecule
tert-butyl
hydroquinone
(
TBHQ
)
inhibits
the
entry
of
influenza
H3
HA
by
binding
to
the
stem
loop
of
HA
and
stabilizing
the
neutral
pH
conformation
of
HA
,
thereby
disrupting
the
membrane
fusion
step
.

Based
on
amino
acid
sequence
,
structure
and
immunogenicity
,
H7
is
a
related
Group
2
HA
.

In
this
work
we
show
,
using
a
pseudovirus
entry
assay
,
that
TBHQ
inhibits
H7
HA-mediated
entry
,
as
well
as
H3
HA-mediated
entry
,
with
an
IC50,6
mM
.

Using
NMR
,
we
show
that
TBHQ
binds
to
the
H7
stem
loop
region
.

STD
NMR
experiments
indicate
that
the
aromatic
ring
of
TBHQ
makes
extensive
contact
with
the
H7
HA
surface
.

Limited
proteolysis
experiments
indicate
that
TBHQ
inhibits
influenza
entry
by
stabilizing
the
H7
HA
neutral
pH
conformation
.

Together
,
this
work
suggests
that
the
stem
loop
region
of
H7
HA
is
an
attractive
target
for
therapeutic
intervention
and
that
TBHQ
,
which
is
a
widely
used
food
preservative
,
is
a
promising
lead
compound
.

A

Strong

Background
:
Patchouli
alcohol
(
PA
)
is
a
tricyclic
sesquiterpene
extracted
from
Pogostemonis
Herba
,
which
is
a
traditional
Chinese
medicine
used
for
therapy
of
inflammatory
diseases
.

Recent
studies
have
shown
that
PA
has
various
pharmacological
activities
,
including
anti-bacterial
and
anti-viral
effects
.

Methods
:
In
this
study
,
the
anti-influenza
virus
(
IAV
)
activities
and
mechanisms
were
investigated
both
in
vitro
and
in
vivo
.

The
inhibitory
effects
of
PA
against
IAV
in
vitro
were
evaluated
by
plaque
assay
and
immunofluorescence
assay
.

The
neuraminidase
inhibition
assay
,
hemagglutination
inhibition
(
HI
)
assay
,
and
western
blot
assay
were
used
to
explore
the
anti-viral
mechanisms
.

The
anti-IAV
activities
in
vivo
were
determined
by
mice
pneumonia
model
and
HE
staining
.

The
results
showed
that
PA
significantly
inhibited
different
IAV
strains
multiplication
in
vitro
,
and
may
block
IAV
infection
through
inactivating
virus
particles
directly
and
interfering
with
some
early
stages
after
virus
adsorption
.

Cellular
PI3K/Akt
and
ERK/MAPK
signaling
pathways
may
be
involved
in
the
anti-IAV
actions
of
PA.
Intranasal
administration
of
PA
markedly
improved
mice
survival
and
attenuated
pneumonia
symptoms
in
IAV
infected
mice
,
comparable
to
the
effects
of
Oseltamivir
.

Conclusions
:
Therefore
,
Patchouli
alcohol
has
the
potential
to
be
developed
into
a
novel
anti-IAV
agent
in
the
future

Serum
procalcitonin

could
be
a
useful
tool
for
selecting
patients
with
a
lower
probability
of
developing
bacterial
infection
,
but
its
measurement
has
not
been
investigated
in
this
population
.

We
conducted
a

admitted
to

Sputum

tracheal
aspirates
were
tested
for
the
presence
of
bacteria

were
measured
at
the
time
of
admittance
,
six

Five

were
detected
in

Among
the

,
one
had
a

The
one
patient
positive
for
Haemophilus

had
a

more
than
0.25

The
presence

did
not
influence

The

This

The

The

levels

generally
low

study
demonstrated
strong
expression

in
CDV-induced
brain
lesions
[

Moreover
,
recent
studies
have
shown
that
the
virulence
of
CDV
depends
on
the
suppression
of
the

interference

The

the

Background
:
Cryopreserved
primary
human
renal
proximal
tubule
epithelial
cells
(
RPTEC
)
were
obtained
from
a
commercial
supplier
for
studies
of
Simian
virus
40
(
SV40
)
.

Within
twelve
hrs
after
cell
cultures
were
initiated
,
cytoplasmic
vacuoles
appeared
in
many
of
the
RPTEC
.

The
RPTEC
henceforth
deteriorated
rapidly
.

Since
SV40
induces
the
formation
of
cytoplasmic
vacuoles
,
this
batch
of
RPTEC
was
rejected
for
the
SV40
study
.

Nevertheless
,
we
sought
the
likely
cause
(
s
)
of
the
deterioration
of
the
RPTEC
as
part
of
our
technology
development
efforts
.

Methods
:
Adventitious
viruses
in
the
RPTEC
were
isolated
and/or
detected
and
identified
by
isolation
in
various
indicator
cell
lines
,
observation
of
cytopathology
,
an
immunoflurorescence
assay
,
electron
microscopy
,
PCR
,
and
sequencing
.

Results
:
Cytomegalovirus
(
CMV
)
was
detected
in
some
RPTEC
by
cytology
,
an
immunofluorescence
assay
,
and
PCR
.

Human
Herpesvirus
6B
was
detected
by
PCR
of
DNA
extracted
from
the
RPTEC
,
but
was
not
isolated
.

Human
coronavirus
NL63
was
isolated
and
identified
by
RT-PCR
and
sequencing
,
and
its
replication
in
a
fresh
batch
of
RPTEC
and
another
type
of
primary
human
kidney
cells
was
confirmed
.

Conclusions
:
At
least
3
different
adventitious
viruses
were
present
in
the
batch
of
contaminated
RPTEC
.

Whereas
we
are
unable
to
determine
whether
the
original
RPTEC
were
pre-infected
prior
to
their
separation
from
other
kidney
cells
,
or
had
gotten
contaminated
with
HCoV-NL63
from
an
ill
laboratory
worker
during
their
preparation
for
commercial
sale
,
our
findings
are
a
reminder
that
human-derived
biologicals
should
always
be
considered
as
potential
sources
of
infectious
agents

infection
will
be
screened
for
eligibility
for
plasma
donation

to
standard
donation
criteria

the
CP
therapy
phase

20
consecutive
critically
ill
patients
admitted
to
intensive
care
unit
with

MERS-CoV
infection
will
be
enrolled
and
each
will
receive
2
units

.

Post
enrollment
,
patients
will
be
followed
for
clinical
and
laboratory
outcomes
that
include

In
order
to
control
the
outbreak

Guangdong
launched
a
new
policy
on
the
central
slaughtering

This
study
aims
to
evaluate
attitudes
of
consumers
and
live-poultry
workers
toward
the
policy

The
live-poultry
workers

Methods
:
Consumers
and
live-poultry
workers
from
Guangdong
were
enrolled
by
stratified
multi-stage
random
sampling

Online
and
field
surveys
were
conducted
to
investigate
participants
'
attitudes
on
policy
implementation
.

Questionnaires
were
developed
to
quantify
participant
demographics
,
to
collect
information
about
attitudes
toward
the
policy
,
and
to
identify
influential
factors
of
policy
acceptability

Proportional
odds
logistics
regression
was
used

completed
the
study

Results
:
Policy
acceptability
percentages
among
consumers

,
37.9
,
and
62.6
%

Logistics
regression
shows
that
consumers
tended
not
to
support
the
policy
if
they
were
males
,
if
they
were
concerned
with
the
food
safety
of
chilled
products
,
and
if
they
preferred
purchasing
live
poultry
.

Live-poultry
traders
tended
not
to
support
if
they
were
subsidized
by
the
government
,
if
they
were
males
,
if
they
experienced
a
drop
in
trading
volume
,
and
if
they
were
unclear
whether
avian
flu
was
a
preventable
disease
.

Finally
,
poultry
farm
workers
tended
not
to
support
if
they
experienced
a

they
operated
a
poultry
farm

and
if
they
experienced
inconvenience
in
their
work
due
to
the
policy
.

The
study
reveals
a
substantial
refusal
or
slowness
to
accept
the
policy
.

Failure
to
accept
the
policy
results
from
varying
reasons
.

Among
consumers
,
concern
about
food
safety
and
dietary
preference
are
two
major
causes
of
disapproval
.

Policy
acceptability
among
live-poultry
workers
diverges
within
the
two
sub-groups
.

While
a
large
percentage
of
poultry
farm
workers
accept
the
policy
,
the
drop
in
trading
and
an
insufficient
subsidy
hamper
acceptance
by
live-poultry
traders
.

We
recommend
that
policy-makers
promote
health
education
and
alleviate
the
policy
impact
on
trading
with
a
reformed
subsidy
policy
to
increase
acceptability
.

These
findings
are
crucial
for
the
prevention
of
human-infected
H7N9
cases
in
Guangdong
.

Background
:
The
gold
standard
for
respiratory
virus
testing
is
a
nasopharyngeal
(
NP
)
swab
,
which
is
collected
by
a
healthcare
worker
.

Midturbinate
(
MT
)
swabs
are
an
alternative
due
to
their
ease
of
collection
and
possible
self-collection
by
patients
.

The
objective
of
this
study
was
to
compare
the
respiratory
virus
isolation
of
flocked
MT
swabs
compared
to
flocked
NP
swabs
.

Methods
:
Beginning
in
October
2008
,
healthy
adults
aged
18
to
69
years
were
recruited
into
a
cohort
and
followed
up
for
symptoms
of
influenza
.

They
were
asked
to
have
NP
and
MT
swabs
taken
as
soon
as
possible
after
the
onset
of
a
fever
or
two
or
more
respiratory
symptoms
with
an
acute
onset
.

The
swabs
were
tested
for
viral
respiratory
infections
using
SeeplexH
RV12
multiplex
PCR
detection
kit
.

Seventy
six
pairs
of
simultaneous
NP
and
MT
swabs
were
collected
from
38
symptomatic
subjects
.

Twenty
nine
(
38
%
)
of
these
pairs
were
positive
by
either
NP
or
MT
swabs
or
both
.

Sixty
nine
(
91
%
)
of
the
pair
results
were
concordant
.

Two
samples
(
3
%
)
for
hCV
OC43/HKU1
and
1
sample
(
1
%
)
for
rhinovirus
A/B
were
positive
by
NP
but
negative
by
MT
.

One
sample
each
for
hCV
229E/NL63
,
hCV
OC43/HKU1
,
respiratory
syncytial
virus
A
,
and
influenza
B
were
positive
by
MT
but
negative
by
NP
.

Conclusions
:
Flocked
MT
swabs
are
sensitive
for
the
diagnosis
of
multiple
respiratory
viruses
.

Given
the
ease
of
MT
collection
and
similar
results
between
the
two
swabs
,
it
is
likely
that
MT
swabs
should
be
the
preferred
method
of
respiratory
cell
collection
for
outpatient
studies
.

In
light
of
this
data
,
larger
studies
should
be
performed
to
ensure
that
this
still
holds
true
and
data
should
also
be
collected
on
the
patient
preference
of
collection
methods
.

Background
:
Phylodynamics
,
the
study
of
the
interaction
between
epidemiological
and
pathogen
evolutionary
processes
within
and
among
populations
,
was
originally
defined
in
the
context
of
rapidly
evolving
viruses
and
used
to
characterize
transmission
dynamics
.

The
concept
of
phylodynamics
has
evolved
since
the
early
21
st
century
,
extending
its
reach
to
slower-evolving
pathogens
,
including
bacteria
and
fungi
,
and
to
the
identification
of
influential
factors
in
disease
spread
and
pathogen
population
dynamics
.

Results
:
The
phylodynamic
approach
has
now
become
a
fundamental
building
block
for
the
development
of
comparative
phylogenetic
tools
capable
of
incorporating
epidemiological
surveillance
data
with
molecular
sequences
into
a
single
statistical
framework
.

These
innovative
tools
have
greatly
enhanced
scientific
investigations
of
the
temporal
and
geographical
origins
,
evolutionary
history
,
and
ecological
risk
factors

with
the

as
human

Conclusions
:
Capitalizing
on
an
extensive
review
of
the
literature
,
we
discuss
the
evolution
of
the
field
of
infectious
disease
epidemiology
and
recent
accomplishments
,
highlighting
the
advancements
in
phylodynamics
,
as
well
as
the
challenges
and
limitations
currently
facing
researchers
studying
emerging
pathogen
epidemics
across
the
globe
.

The
influenza
virus
surface
glycoprotein
hemagglutinin
(
HA
)
is
responsible
for
viral
attachment
to
sialic
acid-containing
host
cell
receptors
and
it
facilitates
the
initial
stage
of
viral
infection
.

In
the
present
study
,
we
isolated
an
RNA
aptamer
specific
to
the
glycosylated
receptor-binding
domain
of
the
HA
protein
(
gHA1
)
after
12
cycles
of
the
systematic
evolution
of
ligands
by
exponential
enrichment
procedure
(
SELEX
)
,
and
we
then
investigated
if
the
selected
aptamer
suppresses
viral
infection
in
host
cells
.

Nitrocellulose
filter
binding
and
enzyme-linked
immunosorbent
assay
(
ELISA
)
experiments
revealed
that
1
RNA
aptamer
,
HA12-16
,
bound
specifically
to
the
gHA1
protein
.

Cell
viability
assay
showed
that
the
HA12-16
RNA
aptamer
suppressed
viral
infection
in
host
cells
by
enhancing
cell
viability
.

Immunofluorescence
microscopic
analysis
further
demonstrated
that
the
HA12-16
RNA
aptamer
suppresses
viral
attachment
to
host
cells
by
neutralizing
the
receptor-binding
site
of
influenza
virus
HA
.

These
results
indicate
that
the
isolated
RNA
aptamer
can
be
developed
as
an
antiviral
reagent
against
influenza
through
appropriate
therapeutic
formulation
.

Lytic
gammaherpesvirus
infection
restricts
host
gene
expression
by
promoting
widespread
degradation
of
cytoplasmic
mRNA
through
the
activity
of
the
viral
endonuclease
SOX
.

Though
generally
assumed
to
be
selective
for
cellular
transcripts
,
the
extent
to
which
SOX
impacts
viral
mRNA
stability
has
remained
unknown
.

We
addressed
this
issue
using
the
model
murine
gammaherpesvirus
MHV68
and
,
unexpectedly
,
found
that
all
stages
of
viral
gene
expression
are
controlled
through
mRNA
degradation
.

Using
both
comprehensive
RNA
expression
profiling
and
half-life
studies
we
reveal
that
the
levels
of
the
majority
of
viral
mRNAs
but
not
noncoding
RNAs
are
tempered
by
MHV68
SOX
(
muSOX
)
activity
.

The
targeting
of
viral
mRNA
by
muSOX
is
functionally
significant
,
as
it
impacts
intracellular
viral
protein
abundance
and
progeny
virion
composition
.

In
the
absence
of
muSOX-imposed
gene
expression
control
the
viral
particles
display
increased
cell
surface
binding
and
entry
as
well
as
enhanced
immediate
early
gene
expression
.

These
phenotypes
culminate
in
a
viral
replication
defect
in
multiple
cell
types
as
well
as
in
vivo
,
highlighting
the
importance
of
maintaining
the
appropriate
balance
of
viral
RNA
during
gammaherpesviral
infection
.

This
is
the
first
example
of
a
virus
that
fails
to
broadly
discriminate
between
cellular
and
viral
transcripts
during
host
shutoff
and
instead
uses
the
targeting
of
viral
messages
to
fine-tune
overall
gene
expression
.

In
this
paper
are
presented
mathematical
predictions
on
the
evolution
in
time
of
the
number
of
positive
cases
in
Italy
of
the
COVID-19
pandemic
based
on
official
data
and
on
the
use
of
a
function
of
the
type
of
a
Gauss
error
function
,
with
four
parameters
,
as
a
cumulative
distribution
function
.

We
have
analyzed
the
available
data
for
China
and
Italy
.

The
evolution
in
time
of
the
number
of
cumulative
diagnosed
positive
cases
of
COVID-19
in
China
very
well
approximates
a
distribution
of
the
type
of
the
error
function
,
that
is
,
the
integral
of
a
normal
,
Gaussian
distribution
.

We
have
then
used
such
a
function
to
study
the
potential
evolution
in
time
of
the
number
of
positive
cases
in
Italy
by
performing
a
number
of
fits
of
the
official
data
so
far
available
.

We
then
found
a
statistical
prediction
for
the
day
in
which
the
peak
of
the
number
of
daily
positive
cases
in
Italy
occurs
,
corresponding
to
the
flex
of
the
fit
,
that
is
,
to
the
change
in
sign
of
its
second
derivative
(
i.e.
,
the
change
from
acceleration
to
deceleration
)
,
as
well
as
of
the
day
in
which
a
substantial
attenuation
of
such
number
of
daily
cases
is
reached
.

We
have
also
analyzed
the
predictions
of
the
cumulative
number
of
fatalities
in
both
China
and
Italy
,
obtaining
consistent
results
.

We
have
then
performed
150
Monte
Carlo
simulations
to
have
a
more
robust
prediction
of
the
day
of
the
above-mentioned
peak
and
of
the
day
of
the
substantial
decrease
in
the
number
of
daily
positive
cases
and
fatalities
.

Although
official
data
have
been
used
,
those
predictions
are
obtained
with
a
heuristic
approach
since
they
are
based
on
a
statistical
approach
and
do
not
take
into
account
either
a
number
of
relevant
issues
(
such
as
number
of
daily
nasopharyngeal
swabs
,
medical
,
social
distancing
,
virological
and
epidemiological
)
or

of

diffusion
.

Background
:
Yokose
virus
was
first
isolated
from
bats
(
Miniopterus
fuliginosus
)
collected
in
Yokosuka
,
Japan
,
in
1971
,
and
is
a
new
member
of
the
family
Flaviviridae
,
genus
Flavivirus
.

In
this
study
,
we
isolated
a
Yokose
virus
from
a
serum
sample
of
Myotis
daubentonii
(
order
Chiroptera
,
family
Vespertilionidae
)
collected
in
Yunnan
province
,
China
in
2013
.

Methods
:
The
serum
specimens
of
bat
were
used
to
inoculate
in
BHK-21
and
Vero
E6
cells
for
virus
isolation
.

Then
the
viral
complete
genome
sequence
was
obtained
and
was
used
for
phylogenetic
analysis
performed
by
BEAST
software
package
.

Results
:
The
virus
was
shown
to
have
cytopathic
effects
in
mammalian
cells
(
BHK-21
and
Vero
E6
)
.

Genome
sequencing
indicated
that
it
has
a
single
open
reading
frame
(
ORF
)
,
with
a
genome
of
10,785
nucleotides
in
total
.

Phylogenetic
analysis
of
the
viral
genome
suggests
that
XYBX1332
is
a
Yokose
virus
(
YOKV
)
of
the
genus
Flavivirus
.

Nucleotide
and
amino
acid
homology
levels
of
the
ORF
of
XYBX1332
and
Oita-36
,
the
original
strain
of
YOKV
,
were
72
and
82
%
,
respectively
.

The
ORFs
of
XYBX1332
and
Oita-36
encode
3422
and
3425
amino
acids
,
respectively
.

In
addition
,
the
non-coding
regions
(
5′-and
3′untranslated
regions
[
UTRs
]
)
of
these
two
strains
differ
in
length
and
the
homology
of
the
5′-and
3′-UTRs
was
81.5
and
78
.

3
%
,
respectively
.

The
isolation
of
YOKV
(
XYBX1332
)
from
inland
China
thousands
of
kilometers
from
Yokosuka
,
Japan
,
suggests
that
the
geographical
distribution
of
YOKV
is
not
limited
to
the
islands
of
Japan
and
that
it
can
also
exist
in
the
inland
areas
of
Asia
.

However
,
there
are
large
differences
between
the
Chinese
and
Japanese
YOKV
strains
in
viral
genome
.

Norovirus
infection
,
a
highly
prevalent
condition
associated
with
a
high
rate
of
morbidity
,
comprises
a
significant
health
issue
.

Although
norovirus
transmission
mainly
occurs
via
the
fecal-oral
and
vomit-oral
routes
,
airborne
transmission
has
been
proposed
in
recent
decades
.

This
paper
re-examines
a
previously
described
norovirus
outbreak
in
a
hotel
restaurant
wherein
airborne
transmission
was
originally
inferred
.

Specifically
,
the
original
evidence
that
suggested
airborne
transmission
was
re-analyzed
by
exploring
an
alternative
hypothesis
:
could
this
outbreak
instead
have
occurred
via
fomite
transmission
?

This
re-analysis
was
based
on
whether
fomite
transmission
could
have
yielded
similar
attack
rate
distribution
patterns
.

Seven
representative
serving
pathways
used
by
waiters
were
considered
,
and
the
infection
risk
distributions
of
the
alternative
fomite
transmission
routes
were
predicted
using
a
multi-agent
model
.

These
distributions
were
compared
to
the
reported
attack
rate
distribution
in
the
original
study
using
a
least
square
methods
approach
.

The
results
show
that
with
some
reasonable
assumptions
of
human
behavior
patterns
and
parameter
values
,
the
attack
rate
distribution
corresponded
well
with
that
of
the
infection
risk
via
the
fomite
route
.

This
finding
offers
an
alternative
interpretation
of
the
transmission
routes
that
underlay
this
particular
norovirus
outbreak
and
an
important
consideration
in
the
development
of
infection
control
guidelines
and
the
investigation
of
similar
norovirus
outbreaks
in
future
.

Influenza
virus
infection
is
a
prevalent
disease
in
humans
.

Antibodies
against
hemagglutinin
have
been
shown
to
prevent
infection
and
hence
hemagglutinin
is
the
major
constituent
of
current
vaccines
.

Antibodies
directed
against
the
highly
conserved
extracellular
domain
of
M2
have
also
been
shown
to
mediate
protection
against
Influenza
A
infection
in
various
animal
models
.

Active
vaccination
is
generally
considered
the
best
approach
to
combat
viral
diseases
.

However
,
passive
immunization
is
an
attractive
alternative
,
particularly
in
acutely
exposed
or
immune
compromized
individuals
,
young
children
and
the
elderly
.

We
recently
described
a
novel
method
for
the
rapid
isolation
of
natural
human
antibodies
by
mammalian
cell
display
.

Here
we
used
this
approach
to
isolate
human
monoclonal
antibodies
directed
against
the
highly
conserved
extracellular
domain
of
the
Influenza
A
M2
protein
.

The
identified
antibodies
bound
M2
peptide
with
high
affinities
,
recognized
native
cell-surface
expressed
M2
and
protected
mice
from
a
lethal
influenza
virus
challenge
.

Moreover
,
therapeutic
treatment
up
to
2
days
after
infection
was
effective
,
suggesting
that
M2-specific
monoclonals
have
a
great
potential
as
immunotherapeutic
agents
against
Influenza
infection
.

Bacterial
pathogens
can
exploit
metabolic
pathways
to
facilitate
their
successful
infection
cycles
,
but
little
is
known
about
roles
of
d-galactosamine
(
GalN
)
/
N-acetyld-galactosamine
(
GalNAc
)
catabolism
pathway
in
bacterial
pathogenesis
.

Here
,
we
report
the
genomic
reconstruction
of
GalN/GalNAc
utilization
pathway
in
Streptococci
and
the
diversified
aga
regulons
.

We
delineated
two
new
paralogous
AgaR
regulators
for
the
GalN/GalNAc
catabolism
pathway
.

The
electrophoretic
mobility
shift
assays
experiment
demonstrated
that
AgaR2
(
AgaR1
)
binds
the
predicted
palindromes
,
and
the
combined
in
vivo
data
from
reverse
transcription
quantitative
polymerase
chain
reaction
and
RNA-seq
suggested
that
AgaR2
(
not
AgaR1
)
can
effectively
repress
the
transcription
of
the
target
genes
.

Removal
of
agaR2
(
not
agaR1
)
from
Streptococcus
suis
05ZYH33
augments
significantly
the
abilities
of
both
adherence
to
Hep-2
cells
and
anti-phagocytosis
against
RAW264.7
macrophage
.

As
anticipated
,
the
dysfunction
in
AgaR2mediated
regulation
of
S.
suis
impairs
its
pathogenicity
in
experimental
models
of
both
mice
and
piglets
.

Our
finding
discovered
two
novel
regulators
specific
for
GalN/GalNAc
catabolism
and
assigned
them
distinct
roles
into
bacterial
infections
.

To
the
best
of
our
knowledge
,
it
might
represent
a
first
paradigm
that
links
the
GalN/GalNAc
catabolism
pathway
to
bacterial
pathogenesis
.

The
porcine
epidemic
diarrhea
virus
(
PEDV
)
is
an
important
swine
pathogen
responsible
for
severe
watery
diarrhea
,
particularly
in
neonatal
piglets
.

Despite
extensive
studies
performed
to
elucidate
the
function
of
several
viral
proteins
,
the
contribution
of
an
accessory
protein
ORF3
in
PEDV
replication
is
still
largely
unknown
.

Here
,
we
constructed
expression
plasmids
as
well
as
recombinant
PEDV
carrying
myc-tagged
ORF3
to
assess
their
expression
and
subcellular
localization
in
both
transfected
and
infected
cells
.

In
PEDV-infected
cells
,
ORF3
was
predominantly
localized
in
the
cytoplasm
,
partially
in
the
endoplasmic
reticulum
(
ER
)
and
the
Golgi
apparatus
(
Golgi
)
.

Interestingly
,
ORF3
with
the
N-terminal
Flag
tag
was
also
detected
on
the
cell
surface
concomitant
with
the
spike
(
S
)
protein
as
determined
by
flow
cytometry
and
confocal
microscopy
.

ORF3
and
S
proteins
were
also
co-localized
at
perinuclear
compartments
and
in
the
vesicle-like
structures
in
transfected
and
infected
cells
.

We
also
demonstrated
that
both
full-length
and
naturally
truncated
ORF3
proteins
could
interact
with
the
S
protein
but
with
different
binding
affinity
,
which
correlate
with
the
ability
of
the
protein
to
regulate
virus
replication
in
cell
culture
.

Collectively
,
our
results
underscore
the
unprecedented
role
of
the
ORF3
,
which
involves
the
interaction
of
ORF3
with
S
and
,
possibly
,
other
structural
protein
during
PEDV
replication
.

Background
:
In
2009
,
China
launched
a
health
reform
to
promote
the
equalization
of
national
essential
public
health
services
package
(
NEPHSP
)
.

The
present
study
aimed
to
describe
the
financing
strategies
and
mechanisms
to
improve
access
to
public
health
for
all
,
identify
the
strengths
and
weaknesses
of
the
different
approaches
,
and
showed
evidence
on
equity
improvement
among
different
regions
.

Methods
:
We
reviewed
the
relevant
literatures
and
identified
208
articles
after
screening
and
quality
assessment
and
conducted
six
key
informants
'
interviews
.

Secondary
data
on
national
and
local
government
health
expenditures
,
NEPHSP
coverage
and
health
indicators
in
2003-2014
were
collected
,
descriptive
and
equity
analyses
were
used
.

Results
:
Before
2009
,
the
government
subsidy
to
primary
care
institutions
(
PCIs
)
were
mainly
used
for
basic
construction
and
a
small
part
of
personnel
expenses
.

Since
2009
,
the
new
funds
for
NEPHSP
have
significantly
expanded
service
coverage
and
population
coverage
.

These
funds
have
been
allocated
by
central
,
provincial
,
municipal
and
county
governments
at
different
proportions
in
China
's
tax
distribution
system
.

Due
to
the
fiscal
transfer
payment
,
the
Central
Government
allocated
more
subsides
to
less-developed
western
regions
and
all
the
funds
were
managed
in
a
specific
account
.

Several
types
of
payment
methods
have
been
adopted
including
capitation
,
pay
for
performance
(
P4P
)
,
pay
for
service
items
,
global
budget
and
public
health
voucher
,
to
address
issues
from
both
the
supply
and
demand
sides
.

The
equalization
of
NEPHSP
did
well
through
the
establishment
of
health
records
,
systematic
care
of
children
and
maternal
women
,
etc
.

Our
data
showed
that
the
gap
between
the
eastern
,
central
and
western
regions
narrowed
.

However
the
coverage
for
migrants
was
still
low
and
performance
was
needed
improving
in
effectiveness
of
managing
patients
with
chronic
diseases
.

Conclusions
:
The
delivery
of
essential
public
health
services
was
highly
influenced
by
public
fiscal
policy
,
and
the
implementation
of
health
reform
since
2009
has
led
the
public
health
development
towards
the
right
direction
.

However
China
still
needs
to
increase
the
fiscal
investments
to
expand
service
coverage
as
well
as
promote
the
quality
of
public
health
services
and
equality
among
regions
.

Independent
scientific
monitoring
and
evaluation
are
also
needed
.

Background
:
Acute
diarrhea
is
one
of
the
most
serious
problems
in
global
public
health
that
causes
considerable
morbidity
and
mortality
worldwide
.

Human
caliciviruses
(
HuCV
)
including
norovirus
(
NoV
,
genogroup
GI
and
GII
)
and
sapovirus
(

)
,
is
a
leading
cause
of
acute
sporadic
diarrhea
in
individuals
across
all
age
groups
.

However
,
few
studies
had
been
conducted
clarifying
the
characteristics
of
HuCV
in
diarrhea
cases
across
all
age
groups
in
China
.

Stool

were
collected
from
1,121
diarrhea

319
healthy
controls
in
outpatient

.

Reverse

(

)
was
used
to
detect
NoV
(
GI
,
GII

and
SaV
.

Sequencing
was
applied
to
confirm
the
three
viral
infections
and
phylogenetic
analysis
was
performed
to
determine
their
genotypes
.

A
structured
questionnaire
was
used
to
record
the
demographic
information
and
clinical
symptoms
of
subjects
.

Results
:
HuCV
was
detected
at
an
11.0

infection
rate
in
1,121

The
prevalence
of
the
NoV
genogroup
GII
and
genotype
GII.4
in

was
significantly
higher
than

.

NoV

was
the

.

Of
the

,
the

had
absolutely

by
the
NoV

.

The
GII.4
Orleans
2009
variant
was
not
found
in
diarrhea
cases
of
the
study
.

Conclusions
:
NoV
GII
was
the
major
genogroup
and
GII.4
was
the
most
predominant
strain
detected
in
diarrhea
patients
.

The
GII.17
is
an
emergent
variant
in
sporadic
diarrhea
and
might
become
the
predominant
strain
in
diarrhea
cases
in
the
near
future
.

Rapid
,
accurate
detection
kits
need
to
be
developed
to
help
us
find
and
treat
NoV-associated
diarrhea
in
clinical
settings
in
a
timely
manner
.

Background
:
The
epidermis
forms
a
critical
barrier
that
is
maintained
by
orchestrated
programs
of
proliferation
,
differentiation
,
and
cell
death
.

Gene
mutations
that
disturb
this
turnover
process
may
cause
skin
diseases
.

Human
GASDERMIN
A
(
GSDMA
)
is
frequently
silenced
in
gastric
cancer
cell
lines
and
its
overexpression
has
been
reported
to
induce
apoptosis
.

GSDMA
has
also
been
linked
with
airway
hyperresponsiveness
in
genetic
association
studies
.

The
function
of
GSDMA
in
the
skin
was
deduced
by
dominant
mutations
in
mouse
gasdermin
A3
(
Gsdma3
)
,
which
caused
skin
inflammation
and
hair
loss
.

However
,
the
mechanism
for
the
autosomal
dominance
of
Gsdma3
mutations
and
the
mode
of
Gsdma3
's
action
remain
unanswered
.

Results
:
We
demonstrated
a
novel
function
of
Gsdma3
in
modulating
mitochondrial
oxidative
stress
.

We
showed
that
Gsdma3
is
regulated
by
intramolecular
fold-back
inhibition
,
which
is
disrupted
by
dominant
mutations
in
the
C-terminal
domain
.

The
unmasked
N-terminal
domain
of
Gsdma3
associates
with
Hsp90
and
is
delivered
to
mitochondrial
via
mitochondrial
importer
receptor
Tom70
,
where
it
interacts
with
the
mitochondrial
chaperone
Trap1
and
causes
increased
production
of
mitochondrial
reactive
oxygen
species
(
ROS
)
,
dissipation
of
mitochondrial
membrane
potential
,
and
mitochondrial
permeability
transition
(
MPT
)
.

Overexpression
of
the
C-terminal
domain
of
Gsdma3
as
well
as
pharmacological
interventions
of
mitochondrial
translocation
,
ROS
production
,
and
MPT
pore
opening
alleviate
the
cell
death
induced
by
Gsdma3
mutants
.

Our
results
indicate
that
the
genetic
mutations
in
the
C-terminal
domain
of
Gsdma3
are
gain-of-function
mutations
which
unmask
the
N-terminal
functional
domain
of
Gsdma3
.

Gsdma3
regulates
mitochondrial
oxidative
stress
through
mitochondrial
targeting
.

Since
mitochondrial
ROS
has
been
shown
to
promote
epidermal
differentiation
,
we
hypothesize
that
Gsdma3
regulates
context-dependent
response
of
keratinocytes
to
differentiation
and
cell
death
signals
by
impinging
on
mitochondria
.

CD8
+
cytotoxic
T
cell
(
CTL
)
responses
are
necessary
for
the
lysis
of
virally
infected
cells
and
control
of
infection
.

CTLs
are
activated
when
their
TCRs
bind
a
major
histocompatibility
complex
(
MHC
)
-I/peptide
complex
on
the
surface
of
antigen
presenting
cells
such
as
macrophages
(
MΦ
)
.

It
is
now
apparent
that
MΦ
display
remarkable
plasticity
in
response
to
environmental
signals
to
polarize
into
classically
activated
M
(
LPS
+
IFN-γ
)
or
alternatively
activated
M
(
IL-4
)
.

However
,
little
is
known
about
how
MΦ
activation
status
influences
their
antigen
presentation
function
to
CD8
+
T
cell
in
models
of
virus
infection
.

Consequently
,
we
tested
how
polarization
of
spleen-derived
(
Sp
)
-MΦ
impacts
direct
presentation
of
viral
antigens
to
influence
effector
and
proliferative
CD8
+
T-cell
responses
.

We
show
that
M
(
IL-4
)
Sp-MΦ
retain
MHC-I
surface
expression
and
the
ability
to
stimulate
IFN-γ
production
by
CTL
following
peptide
stimulation
and
lymphocytic
choriomeningitis
virus
infection
to
levels
similar
to
M0
and
M
(

.

However

Acute
respiratory
infections
(
ARIs
)
cause
a
considerable
morbidity
and
mortality
worldwide
especially
in
children
.

However
,
there
are
few
studies
of
the
etiological
structure
of
ARIs
in
Russia
.

In
this
work
,
we
analyzed
the
etiology
of
ARIs
in
children
(
0-15
years

)
admitted
to
Novosibirsk
Children

Hospital
in
2013-2017
.

We
tested
nasal

of
1560
children
with
upper

Background
:
Kawasaki

(
KD
)
is
a
systemic
vasculitis
with
unknown

and
associated
with
KD

.

This
study
was
conducted
to
investigate
the
association
between
genetic
polymorphisms
of
CD209
and
the
risk

.

Methods
:
A
total
of
948
subjects
(
381
KD
and
567

)
were
recruited
.

Nine

.

Results
:
Significant
associations
were
found
between
CD209
polymorphisms
(
rs4804800
,
rs2287886
,
rs735240
)
and
the
risk
of

.

Haplotype
analysis
for
CD209

showed
that
A/A/G
haplotype
(
P
=

)
and
G/A/G
haplotype
(
P
=
0.0365
,
OR
=

)
had
higher
risk
of
KD
as
compared
with
G/G/A
haplotype
in
rs2287886/rs735239/rs735240

There
were
no
significant
association
in

with
regards
to
CAL
formation
and
IVIG
treatment
responses
.

Conclusion
:
CD209
polymorphisms
were
responsible
for
the
susceptibility
of
KD
,
but
not

Background
:
Classical
scrapie
in
sheep
is
a
fatal
neurodegenerative
disease
associated
with
the
conversion
PrP
C
to
PrP
Sc
.

Much
is
known
about
genetic
susceptibility
,
uptake
and
dissemination
of
PrP
Sc
in
the
body
,
but
many
aspects
of
prion
diseases
are
still
unknown
.

Different
proteomic
techniques
have
been
used
during
the
last
decade
to
investigate
differences
in
protein
profiles
between
affected
animals
and
healthy
controls
.

We
have
investigated
the
protein
profiles
in
serum
of
sheep
with
scrapie
and
healthy
controls
by
SELDI-TOF-MS
and
LC-MS/MS
.

Latent
Variable
methods
such
as
Principal
Component
Analysis
,
Partial
Least
Squares-Discriminant
Analysis
and
Target
Projection
methods
were
used
to
describe
the
MS
data
.

Results
:
The
serum
proteomic
profiles
showed
variable
differences
between
the
groups
both
throughout
the
incubation
period
and
at
the
clinical
end
stage
of
scrapie
.

At
the
end
stage
,
the
target
projection
model
separated
the
two
groups
with
a
sensitivity
of
97.8
%
,
and
serum
amyloid
A
was
identified
as
one
of
the
protein
peaks
that
differed
significantly
between
the
groups
.

Conclusions
:
At
the
clinical
end
stage
of
classical
scrapie
,
ten
SELDI
peaks
significantly
discriminated
the
scrapie
group
from
the
healthy
controls
.

During
the
non-clinical
incubation
period
,
individual
SELDI
peaks
were
differently
expressed
between
the
groups
at
different
time
points
.

Investigations
of
differences
in
-omic
profiles
can
contribute
to
new
insights
into
the
underlying
disease
processes
and
pathways
,
and
advance
our
understanding
of
prion
diseases
,
but
comparison
and
validation
across
laboratories
is
difficult
and
challenging
.

Background
:
The
envelope
glycoprotein
of
lymphocytic
choriomeningitis
virus
(
LCMV
)
can
efficiently
pseudotype
lentiviral
vectors
.

Some
strains
of
LCMV
exploit
high
affinity
interactions
with
α-dystroglycan
(
α-DG
)
to
bind
to
cell
surfaces
and
subsequently
fuse
in
low
pH
endosomes
.

LCMV
strains
with
low
α-DG
affinity
utilize
an
unknown
receptor
and
display
unique
tissue
tropisms
.

We
pseudotyped
non-primate
feline
immunodeficiency
virus
(
FIV
)
vectors
using
LCMV
derived
glycoproteins
with
high
or
low
affinity
to
α-DG
and
evaluated
their
properties
in
vitro
and
in
vivo
.

Methods
:
We
pseudotyped
FIV
with
the
LCMV
WE54
strain
envelope
glycoprotein
and
also
engineered
a
point
mutation
in
the
WE54
envelope
glycoprotein
(
L260F
)
to
diminish
α-DG
affinity
and
direct
binding
to
alternate
receptors
.

We
hypothesized
that
this
change
would
alter
in
vivo
tissue
tropism
and
enhance
gene
transfer
to
neonatal
animals
.

Results
:
In
mice
,
hepatic
αand
β-DG
expression
was
greatest
at
the
late
gestational
and
neonatal
time
points
.

When
displayed
on
the
surface
of
the
FIV
lentivirus
the
WE54
L260F
mutant
glycoprotein
bound
weakly
to
immobilized
α-DG
.

Additionally
,
LCMV
WE54
pseudotyped
FIV
vector
transduction
was
neutralized
by
preincubation
with
soluble
α-DG
,
while
the
mutant
glycoprotein
pseudotyped
vector
was
not
.

In
vivo
gene
transfer
in
adult
mice
with
either
envelope
yielded
low
transduction
efficiencies
in
hepatocytes
following
intravenous
delivery
.

In
marked
contrast
,
neonatal
gene
transfer
with
the
LCMV
envelopes
,
and
notably
with
the
FIV-L260F
vector
,
conferred
abundant
liver
and
lower
level
cardiomyocyte
transduction
as
detected
by
luciferase
assays
,
bioluminescent
imaging
,
and
β-galactosidase
staining
.

Conclusions
:
These
results
suggest
that
a
developmentally
regulated
receptor
for
LCMV
is
expressed
abundantly
in
neonatal
mice
.

LCMV
pseudotyped
vectors
may
have
applications
for
neonatal
gene
transfer

Background
Bronchiolitis
is
the
leading
cause
of
hospitalization
in
infants
.

Biomarkers

Objective
To
determine
the
clinical
predictiveness
of
NW-LDH
,
NW-caspase
3/7
,
and
NW-LDH/NW-caspase
3/7
ratio
in
bronchiolitis
.

Methods
Previously
healthy
children
less
than
24
months
of
age
with
bronchiolitis
were
recruited
from
the
Texas
Children
's
emergency
room
and
intensive
care
unit
from
October
2010
to
April
2011
.

Demographic
,
clinical
information
,
and
NW
samples
were
obtained
at
enrollment
.

NW
samples
were
analyzed
for
respiratory
viruses
,
caspase
3/7
,
and
LDH
.

Results
A
viral
pathogen
was
detected
in
91Á6
%
of
131
children
,
with
the
most
common
being
respiratory
syncytial
virus
and
human
rhinovirus
.

A
single
infection
was
found
in
61Á8
%
of
subjects
and
co-infection
in
29Á8
%
.

Children
admitted
to
ICU
had
significantly
higher
NW-LDH
than
children
sent
home
from
the
ER
or
admitted
to
the
general
floor
(
P
=
0Á02
)
.

Children
infected
with
RSV
had
the
highest
NW-LDH
concentration
(
P
=
0Á03
)
compared
with
other
viral
infections
.

NW-LDH
and
NW-caspase
were
significantly
correlated
(
r
=
0Á77
,
P
<
0Á0001
)
.

The
univariate
models
showed
NW-LDH
and
NW-LDH/NW-caspase
3/7
ratio
were
directly
associated
with
hospitalization
.

Mutivariate
regression
analyses
suggested
a
complex
interaction
between
the
biomarkers
,
demographics
,
and
disposition
.

Conclusions
NW-LDH
,
NW-caspase
3/7
and
NW-LDH/NWcaspase
3/7
ratio
and
their
interactions
with
demographic
factors
are
predictive
of
bronchiolitis
severity
and
can
help
distinguish
children
requiring
ICU-level

Lactate

and
caspase
activity
in
nasopharyngeal

are
predictors
of
bronchiolitis
severity
.

Background
:
Fidelity
of
DNA
polymerases
can
be
influenced
by
cation
co-factors
.

Physiologically
,
Mg
2+
is
used
as
a
co-factor
by
HIV
reverse
transcriptase
(
RT
)
to
perform
catalysis
;
however
,
alternative
cations
including
Mn
2+
,
Co
2
+
,
and
Zn
2+
can
also
support
catalysis
.

Although
Zn
2+
supports
DNA
synthesis
,
it
inhibits
HIV
RT
by
significantly
modifying
RT
catalysis
.

Zn
2+
is
currently
being
investigated
as
a
component
of
novel
treatment
options
against
HIV
and
we
wanted
to
investigate
the
fidelity
of
RT
with
Zn
2+
.

Methods
:
We
used
PCR-based
and
plasmid-based
alpha
complementation
assays
as
well
as
steady-state
misinsertion
and
misincorporation
assays
to

The
envelope
spike
(
S
)
proteins
of
MERS-CoV
and
SARS-CoV
determine
the
virus
host
tropism
and
entry
into
host
cells
,
and
constitute
a
promising
target
for
the
development
of
prophylactics
and
therapeutics
.

Here
,
we
present
high-resolution
structures
of
the
trimeric
MERS-CoV
and
SARS-CoV
S
proteins
in
its
pre-fusion
conformation
by
single
particle
cryo-electron
microscopy
.

The
overall
structures
resemble
that
from
other
coronaviruses
including
HKU1
,
MHV
and
NL63
reported
recently
,
with
the
exception
of
the
receptor
binding
domain
(
RBD
)
.

We
captured
two
states
of
the
RBD
with
receptor
binding
region
either
buried
(
lying
state
)
or
exposed
(
standing
state
)
,
demonstrating
an
inherently
flexible
RBD
readily
recognized
by
the
receptor
.

Further
sequence
conservation
analysis
of
six
human-infecting
coronaviruses
revealed
that
the
fusion
peptide
,
HR1
region
and
the
central
helix
are
potential
targets
for
eliciting
broadly

The
pilus

,
provides
a
structural

We

the
4.2
Å
resolution
structure
of
the
type

pilus
rod
using
cryo-electron
microscopy
.

Residues
forming
the
interactive
surfaces
that
determine
the
mechanical
properties
of
the
rod
were
maintained
by
selection
based
on
a
global
alignment
of
fimA
sequences
.

We
identified
mutations
that
did
not
alter
pilus
production
in
vitro
but
reduced
the
force
required
to
unwind
the
rod
.

UPEC
expressing
these
mutant
pili
were
significantly
attenuated
in
bladder
infection
and
intestinal
colonization
in

.

This
study
elucidates
an
unappreciated
functional
role
for
the
molecular
spring-like
property
of
type
1
pilus

human
and
animal
diseases
must
comply
with
regulatory
requirements
as
they
pertain
to
environmental
risk
assessment
,
particularly
the
characterization
of
potential
adverse
effects
to
humans
,
animals
and
the
environment
.

MVA
and
recombinant
MVA
are
widely
believed
to
pose
low
or
negligible
risk
to
ecosystem
health
.

However
,
key
aspects
of
MVA
biology
require
further
research
in
order
to
provide
data
needed
to
evaluate
the
potential
risks
that
may
occur
due
to
the
use
of
MVA
and
MVA-vectored
vaccines
.

The
purpose
of
this
paper
is
to
identify
knowledge
gaps
in
the
biology
of
MVA
and
recombinant
MVA
that
are
of
relevance
to
its
hazard
characterization
and
discuss
ongoing
and
future
experiments
aimed
at
providing
data
necessary
to
fill
in
the
knowledge
gaps
.

In
addition
,
we
presented
arguments
for
the
inclusion
of
uncertainty
analysis
and
experimental
investigation
of
verifiable
worst-case
scenarios
in
the
environmental
risk
assessment
of
MVA
and
recombinant
MVA
.

These
will
contribute
to
improved
risk
assessment
of
MVA
and

vaccines

.

Many
viruses
have
been
used
as
GMVs
for
vaccination
purposes
,
the
major
ones
being
Poxviridae
(
Vaccinia
virus
;
VACV
)
,
Retroviridae
(
including
lentivirus
)
,
Adenoviridae
(
human
Adenovirus
;
hAdV
)
,
Parvoviridae
(
Adeno-associated
virus
;
AAV
)
,
Herpesviridae
(
cytomegalovirus
;
CMV
)
and
Paramyxoviridae
(
sendai
virus
;
SeV
)
[
1
,
2
]
.

Each
has
unique
attributes
and
associated
risks
when
used
as
a
GM
virus
vaccine
or
vector
.

VACV-based
vectors
have
good
historical
precedence
on
safety
in
that
VACV
and
modified
vaccinia
virus
Ankara
(
MVA
)
were
used
in
smallpox
vaccination
.

VACV-based
vectors
were
also
well
tolerated
in
clinical
trials
,
although
adverse
effects
were
recorded
in
some
studies
at
high
dose
(
over
10
8
pfu
)
of
MVA
[
3
]
.

Disadvantages
of
vectors
based
on
VACV
include
limited
immunogenicity
and
pre-existing
immunity
[
4
]
.

Recombinant
AdV
vectors
have
the
advantage
of
high
transduction
efficiency
,
a
high
level
of
transgene
expression
,
broad
cell
tropism
and
the
ability
to
infect
both
dividing
and
non-dividing
cells
[
5
]
.

The
AdV
vectors
are
also
well
tolerated
but
the
presence
of
pre-existing
anti-AdV
immunity
is
a
disadvantage
associated
with
them
[

]
[

]
[
8
]
.

Similar
to
AdV
,
AAV
can
infect
dividing
and
non-dividing
cells
and
has
broad
cell
tropism
.

In
addition
,
AAV
vectors
also
provide
long-term
transgene
expression
,
however
,
they
may
require
host
genome
integration
for
viral
gene
expression
[
9
]
.

Retrovirus
and
AAV
vectors
provide
long-term
gene
expression
and
they
are
not
plagued
with
pre-existing
immunity
.

However
,
their
package
size
is
limited
to
4.5
and
7.5
kilobases
respectively
[
10
]
and
retroviruses
are
associated
with
various
diseases
,
e.g.
,
leukemia
,
lymphoma
and
AIDS
[
11
,
12
]
.

Vectors
derived
from
SeV
show
high
efficiency
in
gene
transfer
and
transduce
both
dividing
and
non-dividing
cells
[
13
]
.

SeV
infects
human
epithelial
cells
efficiently
and
can
therefore
be
administered
intranasally
.

This
reduces
the
influence
of
pre-existing
immunity
compared
to
intramuscular
administration
[

]
.

These
advantages/benefits
of
the
various
GMVs
are
being
exploited
in
improving
virus-based
GM
vaccines
,
while
efforts
are
underway
to
reduce
their
limitations
.

Canine
cancer
rates
are
similar
to
humans
,
though
the
therapeutic
options
might
be
limited
.

Inducing
a
patient
's
own
immune
system
to
have
an
anti-tumor
response
is
an
attractive
approach
to
cancer
therapy
.

In
this
safety
study
,
autologous
tumor
vaccines
produced
specifically
for
each
canine
patient
were
combined
with
Advax™
,
a
novel
non-inflammatory
immunomodulator
and
vaccine
adjuvant
and
were
tested
for
safety
in
a
diverse
range
of
patient
presentations
alone
or
in
combination
with
other
treatments
.

Canine
patients
had
their
tumor
biopsied
,
debulked
or
resected
and
the
tumor
antigens
were
processed
into
an
autologous
vaccine
formulated
with
Advax™
adjuvant
with
or
without
rhizavidin
as
an
additional
immune
stimulant
.

Patients
treated
early
in
the
trial
received
two
intramuscular
(
IM
)
doses
,
2
weeks
apart
.

As
the
study
progressed
and
no
issues
of
safety
were
observed
,
the
protocol
was
changed
to
weekly
vaccinations
for
4
weeks
followed
by
monthly
booster
shots
.

Over
the
150
I.M
injections
delivered
to
date
,
the
vaccine
was
found
to
be
very
safe
and
no
significant
adverse
reactions
were
observed
.

These
results
justify
ongoing
development
and
future
controlled
studies
of
this
autologous
vaccine
approach
.

In
the
field
of
host-guest
chemistry
,
some
of
the
most
widely
used
hosts
are
probably
cyclodextrins
(
CDs
)
.

As
CDs
are
able
to
increase
the
water
solubility
of
numerous
drugs
by
inclusion
into
their
hydrophobic
cavity
,
they
have
been
widespread
used
to
develop
numerous
pharmaceutical
formulations
.

Nevertheless
,
CDs
are
also
able
to
interact
with
endogenous
substances
that
originate
from
an
organism
,
tissue
or
cell
.

These
interactions
can
be
useful
for
a
vast
array
of
topics
including
cholesterol
manipulation
,
treatment
of
Alzheimer
's
disease
,
control
of
pathogens
,
etc
.

In
addition
,
the
use
of
natural
CDs
offers
the
great
advantage
of
avoiding
or
reducing
the
use
of
common
petroleum-sourced
drugs
.

In
this
paper
,
the
general
features
and
applications
of
CDs
have
been
reviewed
as
well
as
their
interactions
with
isolated
biomolecules
leading
to
the
formation
of
inclusion
or
exclusion
complexes
.

Finally
,
some
potential
medical
applications
are
highlighted
throughout
several
examples
.

2644

Tuberculosis
(
TB
)
,
an
infectious
disease
caused
by
Mycobacterium
tuberculosis
(
Mtb
)
,
kills
5,000
people
per
day
globally
.

Rapid
development
and
spread
of
various
multi
drug-resistant
strains
of
Mtb
emphasize
that
an
effective
vaccine
is
still
the
most
cost-effectives
and
efficient
way
of
controlling
and
eradicating
TB
.

Bacillus
Calmette-Guerin
(
BCG
)
,
the
only
licensed
TB
vaccine
,
still
remains
the
most
widely
administered
human
vaccine
,
but
is
inefficient
in
protecting
from
pulmonary
TB
in
adults
.

The
protective
immunity
afforded
by
BCG
is
thought
to
wane
with
time
and
considered
to
last
only
through
adolescent
years
.

Heterologous
boosting
of
BCG-primed
immune
responses
using
a
subunit
vaccine
represents
a
promising
vaccination
approach
to
promote
strong
cellular
responses
against
Mtb
.

In
our
earlier
studies
,
we
discovered
lipopeptides
of
ESAT-6
antigen
with
strong
potential
as
a
subunit
vaccine
candidate
.

Here
,
we
have
investigated
that
potential
as
a
booster
to
BCG
vaccine
in
both
a
pre-exposure
preventive
vaccine
and
a
post-exposure
therapeutic
vaccine
setting
.

Surprisingly
,
our
results
demonstrated
that
boosting
BCG
with
subunit
vaccine
shortly
before
Mtb
challenge
did
not
improve
the
BCG-primed
immunity
,
whereas
the
subunit
vaccine
boost
after
Mtb
challenge
markedly
improved
the
quantity
and
quality
of
effector
T
cell
responses
and
significantly
reduced
Mtb
load
in
lungs
,
liver
and
spleen
in
mice
.

These
studies
suggest
that
ESAT-6
lipopeptide-based
subunit
vaccine
was
ineffective
in
overcoming
the
apparent
immunomodulation
induced
by
BCG
vaccine
in
Mtb
uninfected
mice
,
but
upon
infection
,
the
subunit
vaccine
is
effective
in
re-educating
the
protective
immunity
against
Mtb
infection
.

These
important
results
have
significant
implications
in
the
design
and
investigation
of
effective
vaccine
strategies
and
immunotherapeutic
approaches
for
individuals
who
have
been
pre-immunized
with
BCG
vaccine
but
still
get
infected
with
Mtb
.

IL-35
,
a
relatively
newly
discovered
cytokine
belonging
to
the
larger
IL-12
family
,
shows
unique
anti-inflammatory
properties
,
believed
to
be
associated
with
dedicated
receptors
and
signaling
pathways
.

IL-35
plays
a
pivotal
role
in
the
development
and
the
function
of
both
regulatory
B
(
Bregs
)
and
T
cells
(
Tregs
)
.

In
order
to
further
its
therapeutic
potential
,
a
dairy
Lactococcus
lactis
strain
was
engineered
to
express
murine
IL-35
(
LL-IL35
)
,
and
this
recombinant
strain
was
applied
to
suppress
collagen-induced
arthritis
(
CIA
)
.

Oral
administration
of
LL-IL35
effectively
reduced
the
incidence
and
disease
severity
of
CIA
.

When
administered
therapeutically
,
LL-IL35
abruptly
halted
CIA
progression
with
no
increase
in
disease
severity
by
reducing
neutrophil
influx
into
the
joints
.

LL-IL35
treatment
reduced
IFN-γ
and
IL-17
3.7-and
8.5-fold
,
respectively
,
and
increased
IL-10
production
compared
to
diseased
mice
.

Foxp3
+
and
Foxp3
−
CD39
+
CD4
+
T
cells
were
previously
shown
to
be
the
Tregs
responsible
for
conferring
protection
against
CIA
.

Inquiry
into
their
induction
revealed
that
both
CCR6
+
and
CCR6
−
Foxp3
+or−
CD39
+
CD4
+
T
cells
act
as
the
source
of
the
IL-10
induced
by
LL-IL35
.

Thus
,
this
study
demonstrates
the
feasibility
and
benefits
of
engineered
probiotics
for
treating
autoimmune
diseases
.

Background
:
Molecular
assays
targeted
to
nucleic
acid
(
NA
)
markers
are
becoming
increasingly
important
to
medical
diagnostics
.

However
,
these
are
typically
confined
to
wealthy
,
developed
countries
;
or
,
to
the
national
reference
laboratories
of
developing-world
countries
.

There
are
many
infectious
diseases
that
are
endemic
in
low-resource
settings
(
LRS
)
where
the
lack
of
simple
,
instrument-free
,
NA
diagnostic
tests
is
a
critical
barrier
to
timely
treatment
.

One
of
the
primary
barriers
to
the
practicality
and
availability
of
NA
assays
in
LRS
has
been
the
complexity
and
power
requirements
of
polymerase
chain
reaction
(
PCR
)
instrumentation
(
another
is

)
.

Methodology/Principal
Findings
:
In
this
article
,
we
investigate
the
hypothesis
that
an
electricity-free
heater
based
on
exothermic
chemical
reactions
and
engineered
phase
change
materials
can
successfully
incubate
isothermal
NA
amplification
assays
.

We
assess
the
heater
's
equivalence
to
commercially
available
PCR
instruments
through
the
characterization
of
the
temperature
profiles
produced
,
and
a
minimal
method
comparison
.

Versions
of
the
prototype
for
several
different
isothermal
techniques
are
presented
.

Conclusions/Significance
:
We
demonstrate
that
an
electricity-free
heater
based
on
exothermic
chemical
reactions
and
engineered
phase
change
materials
can
successfully
incubate
isothermal
NA
amplification
assays
,
and
that
the
results
of
those
assays
are
not
significantly
different
from
ones
incubated
in
parallel
in
commercially
available
PCR
instruments
.

These
results
clearly
suggest
the
potential
of
the
non-instrumented
nucleic
acid
amplification
(
NINA
)
heater
for
molecular
diagnostics
in
LRS
.

When
combined
with
other
innovations
in
development
that
eliminate
power
requirements
for
sample
preparation
,
cold
reagent
storage
,
and
readout
,
the
NINA
heater
will
comprise
part
of
a
kit
that
should
enable
electricity-free
NA
testing
for
many
important
analytes
.

Feline
leukemia
virus
(
FeLV
)
and
feline
immunodeficiency
virus
(
FIV
)
are
retroviruses
with
global
impact
on
the
health
of
domestic
cats
.

The
two
viruses
differ
in
their
potential
to
cause
disease
.

FeLV
is
more
pathogenic
,
and
was
long
considered
to
be
responsible
for
more
clinical
syndromes
than
any
other
agent
in
cats
.

FeLV
can
cause
tumors
(
mainly
lymphoma
)
,
bone
marrow
suppression
syndromes
(
mainly
anemia
)
,
and
lead
to
secondary
infectious
diseases
caused
by
suppressive
effects
of
the
virus
on
bone
marrow
and
the
immune
system
.

Today
,
FeLV
is
less
commonly
diagnosed
than
in
the
previous
20
years
;
prevalence
has
been
decreasing
in
most
countries
.

However
,
FeLV
importance
may
be
underestimated
as
it
has
been
shown
that
regressively
infected
cats
(
that
are
negative
in
routinely
used
FeLV
tests
)
also
can
develop
clinical
signs
.

FIV
can
cause
an
acquired
immunodeficiency
syndrome
that
increases
the
risk
of
opportunistic
infections
,
neurological
diseases
,
and
tumors
.

In
most
naturally
infected
cats
,
however
,
FIV
itself
does
not
cause
severe
clinical
signs
,
and
FIV-infected
cats

Patients
with
severe
viral
infections
are
often
hospitalized
in
intensive
care
units
(
ICUs
)
and
recent
studies
underline
the
frequency
of
viral
detection
in
ICU
patients
.

Viral
infections
in
the
ICU
often
involve
the
respiratory
or
the
central
nervous
system
and
can
cause
significant
morbidity
and
mortality
especially
in
immunocompromised
patients
.

The
mainstay
of
therapy
of
viral
infections
is
supportive
care
and
antiviral
therapy
when
available
.

Increased
understanding
of
the
molecular
mechanisms
of
viral
infection
has
provided
great
potential
for
the
discovery
of
new
antiviral
agents
that
target
viral
proteins
or
host
proteins
that
regulate
immunity
and
are
involved
in
the
viral
life
cycle
.

These
novel
treatments
need
to
be
further
validated
in
animal
and
human
randomized
controlled
studies
.

We
have
previously
demonstrated
that
3-hydroxyphthalic
anhydride
(
3HP
)
-modified
bovine
beta-lactoglobulin
(
3HP-β-LG
)
is
highly
effective
in
inhibiting
entry
of
pseudovirus
(
PsV
)
of
high-and
low-risk
human
papillomavirus
(
HPV
)
into
the
target
cell
.

Intravaginally
applied
3HP-β-LG-containing
vaginal
gel
could
significantly
inhibit
HPV
infection
and
reduce
viral
load
in
the
cervical
region
.

However
,
we
still
do
not
understand
the
underlying
molecular
mechanism
by
which
3HP-β-LG
is
able
to
inhibit
HPV
infection
.

Here
,
though
,
we
showed
that
3HP-β-LG
did
not
inactivate
HPV
PsV
,
but
rather
blocked
entry
of
HPV
PsV
into
the
target
cell
via
its
interaction
with
virus
,
not
cell
.

It
bound
to
the
positively
charged
region
in
the
HPV
L1
protein
,
suggesting
that
3HP-β-LG
binds
to
HPV
L1
protein
through
the
interaction
between
the
negatively
charged
region
in
3HP-β-LG
and
the
positively
charged
region
in
HPV
L1
protein
,
thus
competitively
blocking
the
binding
of
HPV
to
the
receptor
on
the
basement
membrane
in
vaginal
mucosa
.

Although
3HP-modified
chicken
ovalbumin
(
3HP-OVA
)
also
carries
high
net
negative
charges
,
it
exhibited
no
anti-HPV
activity
,
suggesting
that
the
interaction
between
3HP-modified
protein
and
HPV
L1
protein
relies
on
both
electrostatic
and
matchable
conformation
of
the
binding
sites
in
both
proteins
.

When
topically
applied
,
3HP-β-LG
did
not
enter
the
host
cell
or
blood
circulation
.

These
findings
suggest
that
3HP-β-LG
targets
HPV
L1
protein
and
blocks
HPV
entry
into
the
host
cell
,
thus
being
safe
and
effective
for
topical
application
in
the
treatment
of
HPV
infection
.

Background
:
Respiratory
tract
infections
(
RTIs
)
are
the
most
common
illness
in
children
,
and
rapid
diagnosis
is
required
for
the
optimal
management
of
RTIs
,
especially
severe
infections
.

Methods
:
Nasopharyngeal
swab
or
sputum
specimens
were
collected
from
children
aged
19
days
to
15
years
who
were
admitted
to
a
hospital
in
Shanghai
and
diagnosed
with
RTIs
.

The
specimens
were
tested
with
the
FilmArray
Respiratory
Panel
,
a
multiplex
PCR
assay
that
detects
16
viruses
,
Mycoplasma
pneumoniae
(
M.
pneumoniae
)
,
Bordetella
pertussis
(
B.
pertussis
)
and
Chlamydophila
pneumoniae
(
C.
pneumoniae
)
.

Results
:
Among
the
775
children
studied
,
626
(
80.8
%
,
626/775
)
tested
positive
for
at
least
one
organism
,
and
multiple
organisms
were
detected
in
198
(
25.5
%
)
.

Rhinoviruses/enteroviruses
(
25.5
%
,
198/775
)
were
detected
most
often
,
followed
by
respiratory
syncytial
virus
(
19.5
%
,
151/775
)
,
parainfluenza
virus
3
(
14.8
%
,
115/775
)
,
influenza
A
or
B
(
10.9
%
)
,
adenovirus
(
10.8
%
)
,
M.
pneumoniae
(
10.6
%
)
and
B.
pertussis
(
6.3
%
)
.

The
prevalence
of
organisms
differed
by
age
,
and
most
of
the
viruses
were
more
common
in
winter
.

Of
the
140
children
suspected
of
having
pertussis
,
35.0
%
(
49/140
)
tested
positive
for
B.
pertussis
.

Conclusions
:
FilmArray
RP
allows
the
rapid
simultaneous
detection
of
a
wide
number
of
respiratory
organisms
,
with
limited
hands-on
time
,
in
Chinese
pediatric
patients
with
RTIs
.

The
incorporation
of
the
envelope
glycoprotein
complex
(
Env
)
onto
the
developing
particle
is
a
crucial
step
in
the
HIV-1
lifecycle
.

The
long
cytoplasmic
tail
(
CT
)
of
Env
is
required
for
the
incorporation
of
Env
onto
HIV
particles
in
T
cells
and
macrophages
.

Here
we
identify
the
Rab11a-FIP1C/RCP
protein
as
an
essential
cofactor
for
HIV-1
Env
incorporation
onto
particles
in
relevant
human
cells
.

Depletion
of
FIP1C
reduced
Env
incorporation
in
a
cytoplasmic
tail-dependent
manner
,
and
was
rescued
by
replenishment
of
FIP1C
.

FIP1C
was
redistributed
out
of
the
endosomal
recycling
complex
to
the
plasma
membrane
by
wild
type
Env
protein
but
not
by
CT-truncated
Env
.

Rab14
was
required
for
HIV-1
Env
incorporation
,
and
FIP1C
mutants
incapable
of
binding
Rab14
failed
to
rescue
Env
incorporation
.

Expression
of
FIP1C
and
Rab14
led
to
an
enhancement
of
Env
incorporation
,
indicating
that
these
trafficking
factors
are
normally
limiting
for
CT-dependent
Env
incorporation
onto
particles
.

These
findings
support
a
model
for
HIV-1
Env
incorporation
in
which
specific
targeting
to
the
particle
assembly
microdomain
on
the
plasma
membrane
is
mediated
by
FIP1C
and
Rab14
.

In
the
global
eradication
program
for
poliomyelitis
,
the
laboratory
diagnosis
plays
a
critical
role
by
isolating
poliovirus
(
PV
)
from
the
stool
samples
of
acute
flaccid
paralysis
(
AFP
)
cases
.

In
this
study
,
we
developed
a
reverse
transcription-loop-mediated
isothermal
amplification
(
RT-LAMP
)
system
for
a
rapid
and
highly
sensitive
detection
of
enterovirus
including
PV
to
identify
stool
samples
positive
for
enterovirus
including
PV
.

A
primer
set
was
designed
for
RT-LAMP
to
detect
enterovirus
preferably
those
with
PV-like
5'NTRs
of
the
viral
genome
.

The
sensitivity
of
RT-LAMP
system
was
evaluated
with
prototype
strains
of
enterovirus
.

Detection
of
enterovirus
from
stool
extracts
was
examined
by
using
RT-LAMP
system
.

We
detected
at
least
400
copies
of
the
viral
genomes
of
PV
(
Sabin
)
strains
within
90
min
by
RT-LAMP
with
the
primer
set
.

This
RT-LAMP
system
showed
a
preference
for
Human
enterovirus
species
C
(
HEV-C
)
strains
including
PV
,
but
exhibited
less
sensitivity
to
the
prototype
strains
of
HEV-A
and
HEV-B
(
detection
limits
of
7,400
to
28,000
copies
)
.

Stool
extracts
,
from
which
PV
,
HEV-C
,
or
HEV-A
was
isolated
in
the
cell
culture
system
,
were
mostly
positive
by
RT-LAMP
method
(
positive
rates
of
15/16
(
=
94
%
)
,
13/
14
(
=
93
%
)
,
and
4/4
(
=
100
%
)
,
respectively
)
.

The
positive
rate
of
this
RT-LAMP
system
for
stool
extracts
from
which
HEV-B
was
isolated
was
lower
than
that
of
HEV-C
(
positive
rate
of
11/21
(
=
52
%
)
)
.

In
the
stool
samples
,
which
were
negative
for
enterovirus
isolation
by
the
cell
culture
system
,
we
found
that
two
samples
were
positive
for
RT-LAMP
(
positive
rates
of
2/38
(
=
5.3
%
)
)
.

In
these
samples
,
enterovirus
96
was
identified
by
sequence
analysis
utilizing
a
seminested
PCR
system
.

Conclusions
:
RT-LAMP
system
developed
in
this
study
showed
a
high
sensitivity
comparable
to
that
of
the
cell
culture
system
for
the
detection
of
PV
,
HEV-A
,
and
HEV-C
,
but
less
sensitivity
to
HEV-B
.

This
RT-LAMP
system
would
be
useful
for
the
direct
detection
of
enterovirus
from
the
stool
extracts
.

Purpose
.

Irreversible
electroporation
(
IRE
)
has
been
demonstrated
to
be
a
safe
and
effective
method
for
locally
advanced
pancreatic
cancer
(
LAPC
)
.

The
aim
of
this
study
was
to
evaluate
the
immunomodulatory
effect
after
IRE
and
to
evaluate
the
prognostic
value
of
variations
of
the
immune
parameters
in
LAPC
patients
after
IRE
.

Methods
.

Peripheral
blood
samples
of
34
patients
were
obtained
preoperatively
and
on
the
third
day
(
D3
)
and
seventh
day
(
D7
)
after
IRE
,
respectively
.

The
phenotypes
of

were
analyzed
by
flow

,
and
dynamic
changes
of
serum
levels
of
cytokines

complement
,
and
immunoglobulin
were
assayed
by
enzyme-linked
immunosorbent
assay
.

Receiver
operating
characteristic
(
ROC
)
curve
and
concordance
index
(
C-index
)
were
used
to
compare
the
survival
predictive
ability
.

Results
.

There
was
a
transitory
decrease
followed
by
a

trend
was
detected
for

after
IRE
.

The
alteration
of
CD8
+
T
cell
between
D3
and
D7
was
identified
as
a
prognostic
factor
for
both
overall
survival
(
OS
)
and
progression-free
survival
(
PFS
)
.

The
values

)
and
C-indexes
of
the
alteration
of
CD8

were
0.816

0.773
and
0.816
and
0.639
,
respectively
,
which
were
larger
than
those
of
other
immune
or
inflammation-based
indexes
.

Conclusions
.

This
study
presented
the
first
evidence
of
IRE-based
immunomodulatory
in
patients
with
LAPC
.

The
alteration
of
CD8
+
T
cell
between
D3
and
D7
showed
relatively
good
performance
and
could
be
used
as
an
effective
tool
for
prognostic
evaluation
for
LAPC
patients
after
IRE

Background
:
'One
Health
'
represents
a
call
for
health
researchers
and
practitioners
at
the
human
,
animal
and
environmental
interfaces
to
work
together
to
mitigate
the
risks
of
emerging
and
re-emerging
infectious
diseases
(
EIDs
)
.

A
One
Health
approach
emphasizing
inter-disciplinary
co-operation
is
increasingly
seen
as
necessary
for
effective
EID
control
and
prevention
.

There
are
,
however
,
socio-political
,
ethical
and
legal
challenges
,
which
must
be
met
by
such
a
One
Health
approach
.

Discussion
:
Based
on
the
philosophical
review
and
critical
analysis
of
scholarship
around
the
theory
and
practice
of
One
Health
it
is
clear
that
EID
events
are
not
simply
about
pathogens
jumping
species
barriers
;
they
are
comprised
of
complex
and
contingent
sets
of
relations
that
involve
socioeconomic
and
socio-political
drivers
and
consequences
with
the
latter
extending
beyond
the
impact
of
the
disease
.

Therefore
,
the
effectiveness
of
policies
based
on
One
Health
depends
on
their
implementation
and
alignment
with
or
modification
of
public
values
.

Summary
:
Despite
its
strong
motivating
rationale
,
implementing
a
One
Health
approach
in
an
integrated
and
considered
manner
can
be
challenging
,
especially
in
the
face
of
a
perceived
crisis
.

The
effective
control
and
prevention
of
EIDs
therefore
requires
:
(
i
)
social
science
research
to
improve
understanding
of
how
EID
threats
and
responses
play
out
;
(
ii
)
the
development
of
an
analytic
framework
that
catalogues
case
experiences
with
EIDs
,
reflects
their
dynamic
nature
and
promotes
inter-sectoral
collaboration
and
knowledge
synthesis
;
(
iii
)
genuine
public
engagement
processes
that
promote
transparency
,
education
and
capture
people
's
preferences
;
(
iv
)
a
set
of
practical

Background
:
Feline
infectious
peritonitis
(
FIP
)
is
considered
highly
fatal
in
its
naturally
occurring
form
,
although
up
to
36
%
of
cats
resist
disease
after
experimental
infection
,
suggesting
that
cats
in
nature
may
also
resist
development
of
FIP
in
the
face
of
infection
with
FIP
virus
(
FIPV
)
.

Previous
experimental
FIPV
infection
studies
suggested
a
role
for
cellmediated
immunity
in
resistance
to
development
of
FIP
.

This
experimental
FIPV
infection
study
in
specific
pathogen

describes
longitudinal
antiviral
T
cell
responses
and
clinical
outcomes
ranging
from
rapid
progression
,
slow
progression
,
and
resistance
to
disease
.

Results
:
Differences
in
disease
outcome
provided
an
opportunity
to
investigate
the
role
of
T
cell
immunity
to
FIP
determined
by
T
cell
subset
proliferation
after
stimulation
with
different
viral
antigens
.

Reduced
total
white
blood
cell
(
WBC
)
,
lymphocyte
and
T
cell
counts
in
blood
were
observed
during
primary
acute
infection
for
all
experimental
groups
including
cats
that
survived
without
clinical
FIP
.

Antiviral
T
cell
responses
during
early
primary
infection
were
also
similar
between
cats
that
developed
FIP
and
cats
remaining
healthy
.

Recovery
of
antiviral
T
cell
responses
during
the
later
phase
of
acute
infection
was
observed
in
a
subset
of
cats
that
survived
longer
or
resisted
disease
compared
to
cats
showing
rapid
disease
progression
.

More
robust
T
cell
responses
at
terminal
time
points
were
observed
in
lymph
nodes
compared
to
blood
in
cats
that
developed
FIP
.

Cats
that
survived
primary
infection
were
challenged
a
second
time
to
pathogenic
FIPV
and
tested
for
antiviral
T
cell
responses
over
a
four
week
period
.

Nine
of
ten
rechallenged
cats
did
not
develop
FIP
or
T
cell
depletion
and
all
cats
demonstrated
antiviral
T
cell
responses
at
multiple
time
points
after
rechallenge
.

Conclusions
:
In
summary
,
definitive
adaptive
T
cell
responses
predictive
of
disease
outcome
were
not
detected
during
the
early
phase
of
primary
FIPV
infection
.

However
emergence
of
antiviral
T
cell
responses
after
a
second
exposure
to
FIPV
,
implicated
cellular
immunity
in
the
control
of
FIPV
infection
and
disease
progression
.

Virus
host
interactions
during
very
early
stages
of
FIPV
infection
warrant
further
investigation
to
elucidate
host
resistance
to
FIP
.

Coronaviruses
infect
animals
and
humans
causing
a
wide
range
of
diseases
.

The
diversity
of
coronaviruses
in
many
mammalian
species
is
contributed
by
relatively
high
mutation
and
recombination
rates
during
replication
.

This
dynamic
nature
of
coronaviruses
may
facilitate
cross-species
transmission
and
shifts
in
tissue
or
cell
tropism
in
a
host
,
resulting
in
substantial
change
in
virulence
.

Feline
enteric
coronavirus
(
FECV
)
causes
inapparent
or
mild
enteritis
in
cats
,
but
a
highly
fatal
disease
,
called
feline
infectious
peritonitis
(
FIP
)
,
can
arise
through
mutation
of
FECV
to
FIP
virus
(
FIPV
)
.

The
pathogenesis
of
FIP
is
intimately
associated
with
immune
responses
and
involves
depletion
of
T
cells
,
features
shared
by
some
other
coronaviruses
like
Severe
Acute
Respiratory
Syndrome
Coronavirus
.

The
increasing
risks
of
highly
virulent
coronavirus
infections
in
humans
or
animals
call
for
effective
antiviral
drugs
,
but
no
such
measures
are
yet
available
.

Previously
,
we
have
reported
the
inhibitors
that
target
3C-like
protease
(
3CLpro
)
with
broad-spectrum
activity
against
important
human
and
animal
coronaviruses
.

Here
,
we
evaluated
the
therapeutic
efficacy
of
our
3CLpro
inhibitor
in
laboratory
cats
with
FIP
.

Experimental
FIP
is
100
%
fatal
once
certain
clinical
and
laboratory
signs
become
apparent
.

We
found
that
antiviral
treatment
led
to
full
recovery
of
cats
when
treatment
was
started
at
a
stage
of
disease
that
would
be
otherwise
fatal
if
left
untreated
.

Antiviral
treatment
was
associated
with
a
rapid
improvement
in
fever
,
ascites
,
lymphopenia
and
gross
signs
of
illness
and
cats
returned
to
normal
health
within
20
days
or
less
of
treatment
.

Significant
reduction
in
viral
titers
was
also
observed
in
cats
.

These
results
indicate
that
continuous
virus
replication
is
required
for
progression
of
immune-mediated
inflammatory
disease
of
FIP
.

These
findings
may
provide
important
insights
into
devising
therapeutic
strategies
and
selection
of
antiviral
compounds
for
further
development
for
important
coronaviruses
in
animals
and
humans
.

Precise
dating
of
viral
subtype
divergence
enables
researchers
to
correlate
divergence
with
geographic
and
demographic
occurrences
.

When
historical
data
are
absent
(
that
is
,
the
overwhelming
majority
)
,
viral
sequence
sampling
on
a
time
scale
commensurate
with
the
rate
of
substitution
permits
the
inference
of
the
times
of
subtype
divergence
.

Currently
,
researchers
use
two
strategies
to
approach
this
task
,
both
requiring
strong
conditions
on
the
molecular
clock
assumption
of
substitution
rate
.

As
the
underlying
structure
of
the
substitution
rate
process
at
the
time
of
subtype
divergence
is
not
understood
and
likely
highly
variable
,
we
present
a
simple
method
that
estimates
rates
of
substitution
,
and
from
there
,
times
of
divergence
,
without
use
of
an
assumed
molecular
clock
.

We
accomplish
this
by
blending
estimates
of
the
substitution
rate
for
triplets
of
dated
sequences
where
each
sequence
draws
from
a
distinct
viral
subtype
,
providing
a
zerothorder
approximation
for
the
rate
between
subtypes
.

As
an
example
,
we
calculate
the
time
of
divergence
for
three
genes
among
influenza
subtypes
A-H3N2
and
B
using
subtype
C
as
an
outgroup
.

We
show
a
time
of
divergence
approximately
100
years
ago
,
substantially
more
recent
than
previous
estimates
which
range
from
250
to
3800
years
ago
.

Background
:
Influenza
is
an
acute
respiratory
infectious
disease
with
a
high
incidence
rate
in
the
Chinese
army
,
which
directly
disturbs
military
training
and
affects
soldiers
'
health
.

Influenza
surveillance
systems
are
widely
used
around
the
world
and
play
an
important
role
in
influenza
epidemic
prevention
and
control
.

Methods
:
As
a
theater
centers
for
disease
prevention
and
control
,
we
established
an
influenza
monitoring
platform
(
IMP
)
in
2014
to
strengthen
the
monitoring
of
influenza-like
illness
and
influenza
virus
infection
.

In
this
study
,
we
introduced
the
constitution
,
influenza
virus
detection
,
and
quality
control
for
an
IMP
.

The
monitoring
effect
was
also
evaluated
by
comparing
the
monitoring
data
with
data
from
national
influenza
surveillance
systems
.

The
experiences
and
problems
associated
with
the
platform
also
were
summarized
.

Results
:
A
theater
IMP
was
established
based
on
3
levels
of
medical
units
,
including
monitoring
sites
,
testing
laboratories
and
a
checking
laboratory
.

A
series
of
measures
were
taken
to
guarantee
the
quality
of
monitoring
,
such
as
technical
training
,
a
unified
process
,
sufficient
supervision
and
timely
communication
.

The
platform
has
run
smoothly
for
3
monitoring
years
to
date
.

In
the
2014-2015
and
2016-2017
monitoring
years
,
sample
amount
coincided
with
that
obtained
from
the
National
Influenza
Surveillance
program
.

In
the
2015-2016
monitoring
year
,
due
to
the
strict
prevention
and
control
measures
,
an
influenza
epidemic
peak
was
avoided
in
monitoring
units
,
and
the
monitoring
data
did
not
coincide
with
that
of
the
National
Influenza
Surveillance
program
.

Several
problems
,
including
insufficient
attention
,
unreasonable
administrative
intervention
or
subordination
relationships
,
and
the
necessity
of
detection
in
monitoring
sites
were
still
observed
.

Conclusions
:
A
theater
IMP
was
established
rationally
and
played
a
deserved
role
in
the
prevention
and
control
of
influenza
.

However
,
several
problems
remain
to
be
solved
.

We
report
the
first
imported
case
of
Rift
Valley
fever
(
RVF
)
in
China
.

The
patient
returned
from
Angola
,
a
non-epidemic
country
,
with
an
infection
of
a
new
reassortant
from
different
lineages
of
Rift
Valley
fever
viruses
(
RVFVs
)
.

The
patient
developed
multiorgan
dysfunction
and
gradually
recovered
with
continuous
renal
replacement
therapy
and
a
short
regimen
of
methylprednisolone
treatment
.

The
disordered
cytokines
and
chemokines
in
the
plasma
of
the
patient
revealed
hypercytokinemia
,
but
the
levels
of
protective
cytokines
were
low
upon
admission
and
fluctuated
as
the
disease
improved
.

Whole-genome
sequencing
and
phylogenetic
analysis
revealed
that
the
imported
strain
was
a
reassortant
comprising
the
L
and
M
genes
from
lineage
E
and
the
S
gene
from
lineage
A
.

This
case
highlights
that
RVFV
had
undergone
genetic
reassortment
,
which
could
potentially
alter
its
biological
properties
,
cause
large
outbreaks
and
pose
a
serious
threat
to
global
public
health
as
well
as
the
livestock
breeding
industry
.

The
state
of
antileishmanial
chemotherapy
is
strongly
compromised
by
the
emergence
of
drug-resistant
Leishmania
.

The
evolution
of
drug-resistant
phenotypes
has
been
linked
to
the
parasites
'
intrinsic
genome
instability
,
with
frequent
gene
and
chromosome
amplifications
causing
fitness
gains
that
are
directly
selected
by
environmental
factors
,
including
the
presence
of
antileishmanial
drugs
.

Thus
,
even
though
the
unique
eukaryotic
biology
of
Leishmania
and
its
dependence
on
parasite-specific
virulence
factors
provide
valid
opportunities
for
chemotherapeutical
intervention
,
all
strategies
that
target
the
parasite
in
a
direct
fashion
are
likely
prone
to
select
for
resistance
.

Here
,
we
review
the
current
state
of
antileishmanial
chemotherapy
and
discuss
the
limitations
of
ongoing
drug
discovery
efforts
.

We
finally
propose
new
strategies
that
target
Leishmania
viability
indirectly
via
mechanisms
of
host-parasite
interaction
,
including
parasite-released
ectokinases
and
host
epigenetic
regulation
,
which
modulate
host
cell
signaling
and
transcriptional
regulation
,
respectively
,
to
establish
permissive
conditions
for
intracellular
Leishmania
survival
.

Leishmania
has
evolved
mechanisms
to
subvert
both
innate
and
adaptive
immune
responses
that
cause
immune
dysregulation
and
the
pathologies
characteristic
of
CL
and
VL
and
ultimately
allow
parasite
proliferation
and
persistent
infection
inside
the
mammalian
host
[
8
]
[
9
]
[
10
]
.

Surprisingly
,
even
though
it
is
very
well
established
that
Leishmania
reprograms
its
host
cell
to
subvert
the
immune
response
and
to
meet
the
nutritional
and
metabolic
needs
for
intracellular
parasite
survival
and
proliferation
[
11
,
12
]
,
there
is
only
little
effort
to
exploit
these
crucial
effects
of
the
parasite
on
the
host
cell
for
antiparasitic
drug
discovery
.

Here
,
we
review
the
current
literature
on
antileishmanial
therapy
and
Leishmania
host-pathogen
interaction
and
discuss
novel
strategies
to
target
host
cell
rather
than
parasite
biology
for
drug
discovery-a
strategy
that
likely
will
be
more
refractory
to
the
emergence
of
drug-resistant
parasites
.

Recent
strategies
to
replace
antimonials
as
first-line
treatment
to
circumvent
their
limitations
with
respect
to
toxicity
[
13
]
and
drug
resistance
[
14
]
largely
rely
on
repurposing
of
existing
drugs
[
15
]
.

These
include
the
antifungal
drug
amphotericin
B
,
the
off-patent
antibiotic
paromomycin
,
the
oral
anticancer
drug
miltefosine
,
and
the
antimalarial
drug
sitamaquine
,
all
of
which
were
shown
efficient
for
treating
leishmaniases
.

Despite
the
success
of
this
repurposing
strategy
,
all
these
therapies
have
important
limitations
:
(
1
)
miltefosine
is
teratogenic
,
can
provoke
acute
gastrointestinal
side
effects
,
and
the
length
of
the
treatment
(
several
weeks
)
causes
poor
treatment
compliance
with
the
risk
of
relapse
[
16
]
,
(
2
)
conventional
amphotericin
B
deoxycholate
is
not
only
nephrotoxic
but
also
costly
and
can
not
be
stored
at
high
temperature
,
rendering
it
unaffordable
in
some
countries
[

,

)
paromomycin
needs
long
parenteral
regimens
,
involving
qualified

]
.

In
addition
,
depending
on
Leishmania
species
and
geographical
area
,
the
parasite
response
to
the
drugs

Background
:
Concurrent
infection
with
porcine
circovirus
type
2
(
PCV2
)
and
porcine
reproductive
and
respiratory
syndrome
virus
(
PRRSV
)
is
known
as
one
of
the
major
causes
for
porcine
respiratory
disease
complex
(
PRDC
)
.

Dual
infection
with
PCV2
and
PRRSV
is
consistently
to
have
more
severe
clinical
presentations
and
pulmonary
lesions
than
infection
with
PCV2
alone
or
PRRSV
alone
.

However
,
it
is
not
known
if
dual
infections
with
PCV2
and
PRRSV
in
different
infection
order
may
lead
to
different
clinical
symptoms
in
the
host
.

To
mimic
the
possible
field
conditions
,
swine
alveolar
macrophages
(
AMs
)
were
inoculated
with
PCV2
and
PRRSV
in
vitro
simultaneously

with
one
virus

was

.

Conclusions
:
Swine
AMs
infected
with
PCV2
first
then
PRRSV
later
or
infected
with
PCV2

The
different
inoculation
orders
of
PCV2
and
PRRSV
in
AMs
leading
to
different
results
in
viral
antigen
positivity
,
cytopathology
,
and
cytokine
profile
may
explain
,
at
least
partially
,
the
underlying
mechanism
of
the
enhanced
pulmonary
lesions
in
PRDC
exerted
by
dual
infection
with
PCV2
and
PRRSV
and
the

.

Objective
:
Cineole
has
mucolytic
,
bronchodilating
and
anti-inflammatory
properties
and
reduces
the
exacerbation
rate
in
patients
suffering
from
COPD
,
as
well
as
ameliorates
symptoms
in
patients
suffering
from
asthma
and
rhinosinusitis
.

Based
on
these
effects
,
we
therefore
postulated
the
hypothesis
that
patients
with
acute
bronchitis
would
also
benefit
from
therapy
with
Cineole
.

Methods
:
As
part
of
a
double-blind
,
placebo-controlled
,
multi-center-study
,
a
total
of
242
patients
with
confirmed
acute
bronchitis
was
randomly
selected
to
participate
.

Over
a
period
of
10
days
,
all
patients
were
administered
3
x
200
mg
of
Cineole
,
or
a
respective
placebo
,
per
day
.

The
primary
outcome
measure
was
a
Bronchitis
Sum
Score
,
which
summarises
the
relevant
symptoms
of
acute
bronchitis
.

Results
:
After
4
days
of
treatment
it
was
notable
,
that
the
patient
group
treated
with
Cineole
,
showed
significantly
more
improvements
of
the
bronchitis-sum-score
than
those
of
the
placebo
group
(
p
=
0.0383
)
.

The
statistical
significant
difference
of
the
individual
outcome
measures
was
especially
underlined
by
the
frequency
of
cough
fits
by
p
=
0.0001
after
4
days
.

The
effects
of
Cineole
in
the
treatment
of
acute
bronchitis
were
clearly
measurable
and
could
be
proven
after
a
treatment
period
of
merely
4
days
.

This
study
corroborates
the
fact
that
Cineole
actively
and
significantly
reduces
cough
frequency
after
four
days
.

Therefore
it
has
been
shown
to
have
a
great
socioeconomic
impact

Ebola
and
marburgviruses
,
members
of
the
family
Filoviridae
,
can
cause
severe
hemorrhagic
fever
in
humans
.

The
ongoing
Ebola
virus
(
EBOV
)
disease
epidemic
in
Western
Africa
claimed
more
than
11,300
lives
and
was
associated
with
secondary
cases
outside
Africa
,
demonstrating
that
filoviruses
pose
a
global
health
threat
.

Bats
constitute
an
important
natural
reservoir
of
filoviruses
,
including
viruses
of
the
recently
identified
Cuevavirus
genus
within
the
Filoviridae
family
.

However
,
the
interactions
of
filoviruses
with
bat
cells
are
incompletely
understood
.

Here
,
we
investigated
whether
filoviruses
employ
different
strategies
to
enter
human
and
bat
cells
.

For
this
,
we
examined
host
cell
entry
driven
by
glycoproteins
(
GP
)
from
all
filovirus
species
into
cell
lines
of
human
and
fruit
bat
origin
.

We
show
that
all
GPs
were
able
to
mediate
entry
into
human
and
most
fruit
bat
cell
lines
with
roughly
comparable
efficiency
.

In
contrast
,
the
efficiency
of
entry
into
the
cell
line
EidNi/41
derived
from
a
straw-colored
fruit
bat
varied
markedly
between
the
GPs
of
different
filovirus
species
.

Furthermore
,
inhibition
studies
demonstrated
that
filoviruses
employ
the
same
host
cell
factors
for
entry
into
human
,
non-human
primate
and
fruit
bat
cell
lines
,
including
cysteine
proteases
,
two
pore
channels
and
NPC1
(
Niemann-Pick
C1
molecule
)
.

Finally
,
processing
of
GP
by
furin
and
the
presence
of
the
mucin-like
domain
in
GP
were
dispensable
for
entry
into
both
human
and
bat
cell
lines
.

Collectively
,
these
results
show
that
filoviruses
rely
on
the
same
host
cell
factors
for
entry
into
human
and
fruit
bat
cells
,
although
the
efficiency
of
the
usage
of
these
factors
might
differ
between
filovirus
species
.

The
innate
immune
response
provides
the
first
line
of
defense
against
viruses
and
other
pathogens
by
responding
to
specific
microbial
molecules
.

Influenza
A
virus
(
IAV
)
produces
double-stranded
RNA
as
an
intermediate
during
the
replication
life
cycle
,
which
activates
the
intracellular
pathogen
recognition
receptor
RIG-I
and
induces
the
production
of
proinflammatory
cytokines
and
antiviral
interferon
.

Understanding
the
mechanisms
that
regulate
innate
immune
responses
to
IAV
and
other
viruses
is
of
key
importance
to
develop
novel
therapeutic
strategies
.

Here
we
used
myeloid
cell
specific
A20
knockout
mice
to
examine
the
role
of
the
ubiquitin-editing
protein
A20
in
the
response
of
myeloid
cells
to
IAV
infection
.

A20
deficient
macrophages
were
hyperresponsive
to
double
stranded
RNA
and
IAV
infection
,
as
illustrated
by
enhanced
NF-kB
and
IRF3
activation
,
concomitant
with
increased
production
of
proinflammatory
cytokines
,
chemokines
and
type
I
interferon
.

In
vivo
this
was
associated
with
an
increased
number
of
alveolar
macrophages
and
neutrophils
in
the
lungs
of
IAV
infected
mice
.

Surprisingly
,
myeloid
cell
specific
A20
knockout
mice
are
protected
against
lethal
IAV
infection
.

These
results
challenge
the
general
belief
that
an
excessive
host
proinflammatory
response
is
associated
with
IAV-induced
lethality
,
and
suggest
that
under
certain
conditions
inhibition
of
A20
might
be
of
interest
in
the
management
of
IAV
infections
.

Acute
respiratory
infections
are
a
major
cause
of
morbidity
in
children
both
in
developed
and
developing
countries
.

A
wide
range
of
respiratory
viruses
,
including
respiratory
syncytial
virus
(
RSV
)
,
influenza

and
B
viruses
,
parainfluenza
viruses
(
PIVs
)
,
adenovirus
,
rhinovirus
(

)
,
have
repeatedly
been
detected
in
acute
lower
respiratory
tract
infections
(
LRTI
)
in
children
in
the
past
decades
.

However
,
in
the
last
ten
years
thanks
to
progress
in
molecular
technologies
,
newly
discovered
viruses
have
been
identified
including
human
Metapneumovirus
(
hMPV
)
,
coronaviruses
NL63
(
HcoV-NL63
)
and
HKU1

)
and
KI
(
KIPyV
)
and
the
pandemic
H1N1v
influenza
A
virus
.

These
discoveries
have
heavily
modified
previous
knowledge
on
respiratory
infections
mainly
highlighting
that
pediatric
population
is
exposed
to
a
variety
of
viruses
with
similar
seasonal
patterns
.

In
this
context
establishing
a
causal
link
between
a
newly
identified
virus
and
the
disease
as
well
as
an
association
between
mixed
infections
and
an
increase
in
disease
severity
can
be
challenging
.

This
review
will
present
an
overview
of
newly
recognized
as
well
as
the
main
emerging
respiratory
viruses
and
seek
to
focus
on
the
their
contribution
to
infection
and
co-infection
in
LRTIs
in
childhood
.

Background
:
Many
commentators
call
for
a
more
ethical
approach
to
planning
for
influenza
pandemics
.

In
the
developed
world
,
some
pandemic
preparedness
plans
have
already
been
examined
from
an
ethical
viewpoint
.

This
paper
assesses
the
attention
given
to
ethics
issues
by
the
Ghana
National
Integrated
Strategic
Plan
for
Pandemic
Influenza
(
NISPPI
)
.

Methods
:
We
critically
analyzed
the
Ghana
NISPPI
's
sensitivity
to
ethics
issues
to
determine
how
well
it
reflects
ethical
commitments
and
principles
identified
in
our
review
of
global
pandemic
preparedness
literature
,
existing
pandemic
plans
,
and
relevant
ethics
frameworks
.

Results
:
This
paper
reveals
that
important
ethical
issues
have
not
been
addressed
in
the
Ghana
NISPPI
.

Several
important
ethical
issues
are
unanticipated
,
unacknowledged
,
and
unplanned
for
.

These
include
guidelines
on
allocation
of
scarce
resources
,
the
duties
of
healthcare
workers
,
ethics-sensitive
operational
guidelines/protocols
,
and
compensation
programs
.

The
NISPPI
also
pays
scant
attention
to
use
of
vaccines
and
antivirals
,
border
issues
and
cooperation
with
neighboring
countries
,
justification
for
delineated
actions
,
and
outbreak
simulations
.

Feedback
and
communication
plans
are
nebulous
,
while
leadership
,
coordination
,
and
budgeting
are
quite
detailed
.

With
respect
to
presentation
,
the
NISPPI
's
text
is
organized
around
five
thematic
areas
.

While
each
area
implicates
ethical
issues
,
NISPPI
treatment
of
these
areas
consistently
fails
to
address
them
.

Conclusions
:
Our
analysis
reveals
a
lack
of
consideration
of
ethics
by
the
NISPPI
.

We
contend
that
,
while
the
plan
's
content
and
fundamental
assumptions
provide
support
for
implementation
of
the
delineated
public
health
actions
,
its
consideration
of
ethical
issues
is
poor
.

Deficiencies
include
a
failure
to
incorporate
guidelines
that
ensure
fair
distribution
of
scarce
resources
and
a
lack
of
justification
for
delineated
procedures
.

Until
these
deficiencies
are
recognized
and
addressed
,
Ghana
runs
the
risk
of
rolling
out
unjust
and
ethically
indefensible
actions
with
real
negative
effects
in
the
event
of
a
pandemic
.

Soliciting
inputs
from
the
public
and
consultation
with
ethicists
during
the
next
revision
of
the
NISPPI
will
be
useful
in
addressing
these
issues
.

In
this
paper
,
a
susceptible-vaccinated-exposed-infectious-recovered
(
SVEIR
)
epidemic
model
for
an
infectious
disease
that
spreads
in
the
host
population
through
horizontal
transmission
is
investigated
,
assuming
that
the
horizontal
transmission
is
governed
by
an
unspecified
function
f
(
S
,
I
)
.

The
role
that
temporary
immunity
(
vaccinated-induced
)
and
treatment
of
infected
people
play
in
the
spread
of
disease
,
is
incorporated
in
the
model
.

The
basic
reproduction
number
R
0
is
found
,
under
certain
conditions
on
the
incidence
rate
and
treatment
function
.

It
is
shown
that
the
model
exhibits
two
equilibria
,
namely
,
the
disease-free
equilibrium
and
the
endemic
equilibrium
.

By
constructing
a
suitable
Lyapunov
function
,
it
is
observed
that
the
global
asymptotic
stability
of
the
disease-free
equilibrium
depends
on
R

as
well
as

If

Background
:
Patients
with
chronic
obstructive
pulmonary
disease
(
COPD
)
can
experience
'exacerbations
'
of
their
conditions
.

An
exacerbation
is
an
event
defined
in
terms
of
subjective
descriptors
or
symptoms
,
namely
dyspnoea
,
cough
and
sputum
that
worsen
sufficiently
to
warrant
a
change
in
medical
management
.

There
is
a
need
for
reliable
markers
that
reflect
the
pathological
mechanisms
that
underlie
exacerbation
severity
and
that
can
be
used
as
a
surrogate
to
assess
treatment
effects
in
clinical
studies
.

Little
is
known
as
to
how
existing
study
variables
and
suggested
markers
change
in
both
the
stable
and
exacerbation
phases
of
COPD
.

In
an
attempt
to
find
the
best
surrogates
for
exacerbations
,
we
have
reviewed
the
literature
to
identify
which
of
these
markers
change
in
a
consistent
manner
with
the
severity
of
the
exacerbation
event
.

We
have
searched
standard
databases
between
1966
to
July
2004
using
major
keywords
and
terms
.

Studies
that
provided
demographics
,
spirometry
,
potential
markers
,
and
clear
eligibility
criteria
were
included
in
this
study
.

Central
tendencies
and
dispersions
for
all
the
variables
and
markers
reported
and
collected
by
us
were
first
tabulated
according
to
sample
size
and
ATS/ERS
2004
Exacerbation
Severity
Levels
I
to
III
criteria
.

Due
to
the
possible
similarity
of
patients
in
Levels
II
and
III
,
the
data
was
also
redefined
into
categories
of
exacerbations
,
namely
out-patient
(
Level
I
)
and
in-patient
(
Levels
II
&
III
combined
)
.

For
both
approaches
,
we
performed
a
fixed
effect
meta-analysis
on
each
of
the
reported
variables
.

We
included
a
total
of
268
studies
reported
between
1979
to
July
2004
.

These
studies
investigated
142,407
patients
with
COPD
.

Arterial
carbon
dioxide
tension
and
breathing
rate
were
statistically
different
between
all
levels
of
exacerbation
severity
and
between
in
out-and
in-patient
settings
.

Most
other
measures
showed
weak
relationships
with
either
level
or
setting
,
or
they
had
insufficient
data
to
permit
meta-analysis
.

Arterial
carbon
dioxide
and
breathing
rate
varied
in
a
consistent
manner
with
exacerbation
severity
and
patient
setting
.

Many
other
measures
showed
weak
correlations
that
should
be
further
explored
in
future
longitudinal
studies
or
assessed
using
suggested
mathematical
modelling
techniques
.

Bats
are
natural
reservoirs
of
coronaviruses
and
other
viruses
with
zoonotic
potential
.

Florida
has
indigenous
non-migratory
populations
of
Brazilian
free-tailed
bats
(
Tadarida
brasiliensis
)
that
mostly
roost
in
colonies
in
artificial
structures
.

Unlike
their
counterparts
in
Brazil
and
Mexico
,
the
viruses
harbored
by
the
Florida
bats
have
been
underexplored
.

We
report
the
detection
of
an
alphacoronavirus
RNA-dependent
RNA
polymerase
(
RdRp
)
gene
sequence
in
the
feces
of
two
of
19
different
T.
brasiliensis
that
were
capture/release
bats
that
had
been
evaluated
for
overall
health
.

The
RdRp
sequence
is
similar
but
not
identical
to
previously
detected
sequences
in
the
feces
of
two
different
species
of
bats
(
T.
brasiliensis
and
Molossus
molossus
)
in
Brazil
.

In
common
with
the
experience
of
others
doing
similar
work
,
attempts
to
isolate
the
virus
in
cell
cultures
were
unsuccessful
.

We
surmise
that
this
and
highly
related
alphacoronavirus
are
carried
by
Brazilian
free-tailed
bats
living
in
a
wide
eco-spatial
region
.

As
various
coronaviruses
(
CoVs
)
that
affect
humans
emerged
from
bats
,
our
study
raises
the
question
whether
CoVs
such
as
the
one
detected
in
our
work
are
yet-to-be-detected
pathogens
of
humans
and
animals
other
than
bats
.

Although
many
studies
provide
strong
evidence
supporting
the
development
of
HCV
virus-like
particle
(
VLP
)
-based
vaccines
,
the
fact
that
heterologous
viral
vectors
and/or
multiple
dosing
regimes
are
required
to
induce
protective
immunity
indicates
that
it
is
necessary
to
improve
their
immunogenicity
.

In
this
study
,
we
have
evaluated
the
use
of
an
anionic
self-adjuvanting
lipopeptide
containing
the
TLR2
agonist
Pam
2
Cys
(
E
8
Pam
2
Cys
)
to
enhance
the
immunogenicity
of
VLPs
containing
the
HCV
structural
proteins
(
core
,
E1
and
E2
)
of
genotype
1a
.

While
co-formulation
of
this
lipopeptide
with
VLPs
only
resulted
in
marginal
improvements
in
dendritic
cell
(
DC
)
uptake
,
its
ability
to
concomitantly
induce
DC
maturation
at
very
small
doses
is
a
feature
not
observed
using
VLPs
alone
or
in
the
presence
of
an
aluminium
hydroxide-based
adjuvant
(
Alum
)
.

Dramatically
improved
VLP
and
E2-specific
antibody
responses
were
observed
in
VLP+E
8
Pam
2
Cys
vaccinated
mice
where
up
to
3
doses
of
non-adjuvanted
or
traditionally
alum-adjuvanted
VLPs
was
required
to
match
the
antibody
titres
obtained
with
a
single
dose
of
VLPs
formulated
with
this
lipopeptide
.

This
result
also
correlated
with
significantly
higher
numbers
of
specific
antibody
secreting
cells
that
was
detected
in
the
spleens
of
VLP+E
8
Pam
2
Cys
vaccinated
mice
and
greater
ability
of
sera
from
these
mice
to
neutralise
the
binding
and
uptake
of
VLPs
by
Huh7
cells
.

Moreover
,
vaccination
of
HLA-A2
transgenic
mice
with
this
formulation
also
induced
better
VLP-specific
IFN-c-mediated
responses
compared
to
nonadjuvanted
VLPs
but
comparable
levels
to
that
achieved
when
coadministered
with
complete
freund
's
adjuvant
.

These
results
suggest
overall
that
the
immunogenicity
of
HCV
VLPs
can
be
significantly
improved
by
the
addition
of
this
novel
adjuvant
by
targeting
their
delivery
to
DCs
and
could
therefore
constitute
a
viable
vaccine
strategy
for
the
treatment
of
HCV
.

Human
cytomegalovirus
(
HCMV
)
is
a
ubiquitous
herpesvirus
that
is
able
to
infect
fibroblastic
,
epithelial
,
endothelial
and
hematopoietic
cells
.

Over
the
past
ten
years
,
several
groups
have
provided
direct
evidence
that
dendritic
cells
(
DCs
)
fully
support
the
HCMV
lytic
cycle
.

We
previously
demonstrated
that
the
C-type
lectin
dendritic
cell-specific
intercellular
adhesion
molecule-3-grabbing
non-integrin
(
DC-SIGN
)
has
a
prominent
role
in
the
docking
of
HCMV
on
monocyte-derived
DCs
(
MDDCs
)
.

The
DC-SIGN/HCMV
interaction
was
demonstrated
to
be
a
crucial
and
early
event
that
substantially
enhanced
infection
in
trans
,
i.e.
,
from
one
CMV-bearing
cell
to
another
non-infected
cell
(
or
trans-infection
)
,
and
rendered
susceptible
cells
fully
permissive
to
HCMV
infection
.

Nevertheless
,
nothing
is
yet
known
about
how
HCMV
enters
MDDCs
.

In
this
study
,
we
demonstrated
that
VHL/E
HCMV
virions
(
an
endothelio/dendrotropic
strain
)
are
first
internalized
into
MDDCs
by
a
macropinocytosis-like
process
in
an
actin-and
cholesterol-dependent
,
but
pH-independent
,
manner
.

We
observed
the
accumulation
of
virions
in
large
uncoated
vesicles
with
endosomal
features
,
and
the
virions
remained
as
intact
particles
that
retained
infectious
potential
for
several
hours
.

This
trans-infection
property
was
specific
to
MDDCs
because
monocytederived
macrophages
or
monocytes
from
the
same
donor
were
unable
to
allow
the
accumulation
of
and
the
subsequent
transmission
of
the
virus
.

Together
,
these
data
allowed
us
to
delineate
the
early
mechanisms
of
the
internalization
and
entry
of
an
endothelio/dendrotropic
HCMV
strain
into
human
MDDCs
and
to
propose
that
DCs
can
serve
as
a
``
Trojan
horse
''
to
convey
CMV
from
entry
sites
to
other
locations
that
may
favor
the
occurrence
of
either
latency
or
acute
infection

Background
:
Mast
cells
are
well
established
effectors
of
IgE-triggered
allergic
reactions
and
immune
responses
to
parasitic
infections
.

Recent
studies
indicate
that
mast
cells
may
play
roles
in
adaptive
and
innate
immunity
,
suggesting
an
innovative
view
of
the
regulation
of
immune
responses
.

Here
,
we
profiled
the
transcriptome
of
human
mast
cells
sensitized
with
IgE
alone
,
or
stimulated
by
FcεRI
aggregation
.

Results
:
Our
data
show
that
among
8,793
genes
examined
,
559
genes
are
differentially
regulated
in
stimulated
mast
cells
when
compared
with
resting/unstimulated
mast
cells
.

The
major
functional
categories

genes
include
cytokines
,
chemokines
,
and
other
genes
involved
in

.

We
observed
the
increased
expression
of
over
63
genetranscripts
following
IgE-sensitization
alone
.

Our
data
was
validated
using
Real-Time-PCR
;
ELISA
and
western
blot
.

We
confirmed
that
IgE
alone
does
not
trigger
mast
cell-immediate
responses
,
such
as
calcium
signals
,
degranulation

Despite
significant
advancement
in
vaccine
and
virus
research
,
influenza
continues
to
be
a
major
public
health
concern
.

Each
year
in
the
United
States
of
America
,
influenza
viruses
are
responsible
for
seasonal
epidemics
resulting
in
over
200,000
hospitalizations
and
30,000-50,000
deaths
.

Accurate
and
early
diagnosis
of
influenza
viral
infections
are
critical
for
rapid
initiation
of
antiviral
therapy
to
reduce
influenza
related
morbidity
and
mortality
both
during
seasonal
epidemics
and
pandemics
.

Several
different
approaches
are
currently
available
for
diagnosis
of
influenza
infections
in
humans
.

These
include
viral
isolation

,
immunofluorescence
assays
,
nucleic
acid
amplification
tests
,
immunochromatography-based
rapid
diagnostic
tests
,
etc
.

Newer
diagnostic
approaches
are
being
developed
to
overcome
the
limitations
associated
with
some
of
the
conventional

The
alarmin
IL-33
has
been
described
to
be
upregulated
in
human
and
murine
viral
hepatitis
.

However
,
the
role
of
endogenous
IL-33
in
viral
hepatitis
remains
obscure
.

We
aimed
to
decipher
its
function
by
infecting
IL-33-deficient
mice
(
IL-33
KO
)
and
their
wild-type
(
WT
)
littermates
with
pathogenic
mouse
hepatitis
virus
(
L2-MHV3
)
.

The
IL-33
KO
mice
were
more
sensitive
to
L2-MHV3
infection
exhibiting
higher
levels
of
AST/ALT
,
higher
tissue
damage
,
significant
weight
loss
,
and
earlier
death
.

increased
depletion

,
and

was
observed
48
h
postinfection
(
PI
)
in
IL-33
KO
mice
than
that
in
WT
mice
.

In
contrast
,
a
massive
influx
of
neutrophils
was
observed
in
IL-33
KO
mice
at
48
h
PI
.

A
transcriptomic
study
of
inflammatory
and
cell-signaling
genes
revealed
the
overexpression
of
IL-6
,
TNFα
,
and
several
chemokines
involved
in
recruitment/activation
of
neutrophils

,
CCL2
,
and

)
at
72

In
conclusion
,
we
demonstrated
that
endogenous
IL-33
had
multifaceted
immunoregulatory
effect
during
viral
hepatitis
via
induction
of

A
variety
of
human
diseases
are
associated
with
gammaherpesviruses
,
including
neoplasms
of
lymphocytes
(
e.g
.

Burkitt
's
lymphoma
)
and
endothelial
cells
(
e.g
.

Kaposi
's
sarcoma
)
.

Gammaherpesvirus
infections
usually
result
in
either
a
productive
lytic
infection
,
characterized
by
expression
of
all
viral
genes
and
rapid
cell
lysis
,
or
latent
infection
,
characterized
by
limited
viral
gene
expression
and
no
cell
lysis
.

Here
,
we
report
characterization
of
endothelial
cell
infection
with
murine
gammaherpesvirus
68
(
cHV68
)
,
a
virus
phylogenetically
related
and
biologically
similar
to
the
human
gammaherpesviruses
.

Endothelial
cells
supported
cHV68
replication
in
vitro
,
but
were
unique
in
that
a
significant
proportion
of
the
cells
escaped
lysis
,
proliferated
,
and
remained
viable
in
culture
for
an
extended
time
.

Upon
infection
,
endothelial
cells
became
nonadherent
and
altered
in
size
,
complexity
,
and
cell-surface
protein
expression
.

These
cells
were
uniformly
infected
and
expressed
the
lytic
transcription
program
based
on
detection
of
abundant
viral
gene
transcripts
,
GFP
fluorescence
from
the
viral
genome
,
and
viral
surface
protein
expression
.

Additionally
,
endothelial
cells
continued
to
produce
new
infectious
virions
as
late
as
30
days
post-infection
.

The
outcome
of
this
long-term
infection
was
promoted
by
the
cHV68
v-cyclin
,
because
in
the
absence
of
the
v-cyclin
,
viability
was
significantly
reduced
following
infection
.

Importantly
,
infected
primary
endothelial
cells
also
demonstrated
increased
viability
relative
to
infected
primary
fibroblasts
,
and
this
increased
viability
was
dependent
on
the
v-cyclin
.

Finally
,
we
provide
evidence
for
infection
of
endothelial
cells
in
vivo
in
immune-deficient
mice
.

The
extended
viability
and
virus
production
of
infected
endothelial
cells
indicated
that
endothelial
cells
provided
a
source
of
prolonged
virus
production
and
identify
a
cell-type
specific
adaptation
of
gammaherpesvirus
replication
.

While
infected
endothelial
cells
would
likely
be
cleared
in
a
healthy
individual
,
persistently
infected
endothelial
cells
could
provide
a
source
of
continued
virus
replication
in
immune-compromised
individuals
,
a
context
in
which
gammaherpesvirusassociated
pathology
frequently
occurs
.

A

Metagenomic
Next-Generation

has
been
employed
to

infectious
etiologies
and
characterize
virus
diversity
in
human
,
animal
,
and
environmental
samples
.

Here
,
we
systematically
reviewed
studies
that
performed
viral
mNGS
in
common
livestock
(
cattle
,
small
ruminants
,
poultry
,
and
pigs
)
.

We
identified
2481
records
and
120
records
were
ultimately
included
after
a
first
and
second
screening
.

Pigs
were
the
most
frequently
studied
livestock
and
the
virus
diversity
found
in
samples
from
poultry
was
the
highest
.

Known
animal
viruses
,
zoonotic
viruses
,
and
novel
viruses
were
reported
in
available
literature
,
demonstrating
the
capacity
of
mNGS
to
identify
both
known
and
novel
viruses
.

However
,
the
coverage
of
metagenomic
studies
was
patchy
,
with
few
data
on
the
virome
of
small
ruminants
and
respiratory
virome
of
studied
livestock
.

Essential
metadata
such
as
age
of
livestock
and
farm
types
were
rarely
mentioned
in
available
literature
,
and
only
10.8
%
of
the
datasets
were
publicly
available
.

Developing
a
deeper
understanding
of
livestock
virome
is
crucial
for
detection
of
potential
zoonotic
and
animal
pathogens
and
One
Health

.

Metagenomic
studies
can
provide
this
background
but
only
when
combined
with
essential
metadata
and
following

In
2007-2010
,
a
large-scale
Q
fever
outbreak
was
reported
in
the
Netherlands
,
affecting
more
than
3500
human
cases
and
resulting
in
a
huge
economic
loss
[

]
.

A
steep
increase
in
the
number
of
goat
farms
most
likely
was
the
driver
for
the
increased
prevalence
of
Coxiella
burnetii
infections
,
with
animal
abortion
waves
that
had
gone
unnoticed
.

The
policy
of
voluntary
reporting
abortion
outbreaks
to
the
Animal
Health
Service
hindered
the
timely
detection
of
the
circulation
of
Q
fever
,
and
therefore
early
interventions
.

These
examples
indicate
that
zoonotic
risks
in
the
livestock
industry
should
be
carefully
managed
and
adapted
to
livestock
intensification
.

The
One

Surveillance
of
livestock

the
surrounding

is
a
hallmark

is
currently

offer
new

However
,
the

Characterizing

provide
a

for

for

Abstract
:
Vaccination
is
the
most
functional
medical
intervention
to
prophylactically
control
severe
diseases
caused
by
human-to-human
or
animal-to-human
transmissible
viral
pathogens
.

Annually
,
seasonal
influenza
epidemics
attack
human
populations
leading
to
290-650
thousand
deaths/year
worldwide
.

Recently
,
a
novel
Middle
East
Respiratory
Syndrome
Coronavirus
emerged
.

Together
,
those
two
viruses
present
a
significant
public
health
burden
in
areas
where
they
circulate
.

Herein
,
we
generated
a
bacterial
outer
membrane
vesicles
(
OMVs
)
-based
vaccine
presenting
the
antigenic
stable
chimeric
fusion
protein
of
the
H1-type
haemagglutinin
(
HA
)
of
the
pandemic
influenza
A
virus
(
H1N1
)
strain
from
2009
(
H1N1pdm09
)
and
the
receptor
binding
domain
(
RBD
)
of
the
Middle
East
Respiratory
Syndrome
Coronavirus
(
MERS-CoV
)
(
OMVs-H1/RBD
)
.

Our
results
showed
that
the
chimeric
antigen
could
induce
specific
neutralizing
antibodies
against
both
strains
leading
to
protection
of
immunized
mice
against
H1N1pdm09
and
efficient
neutralization
of
MERS-CoV
.

This
study
demonstrate
that
OMVs-based
vaccines
presenting
viral
antigens
provide
a
safe
and
reliable
approach
to
protect
against
two
different
viral
infections
.

Both
environmental
factors
and
genetic
factors
are
involved
in
the
pathogenesis
of
autism
spectrum
disorders
(
ASDs
)
.

Epigenetics
,
an
essential
mechanism
for
gene
regulation
based
on
chemical
modifications
of
DNA
and
histone
proteins
,
is
also
involved
in
congenital
ASDs
.

It
was
recently
demonstrated
that
environmental
factors
,
such
as
endocrine
disrupting
chemicals
and
mental
stress
in
early
life
,
can
change
epigenetic
status
and
gene
expression
,
and
can
cause
ASDs
.

Moreover
,
environmentally
induced
epigenetic
changes
are
not
erased
during
gametogenesis
and
are
transmitted
to
subsequent
generations
,
leading
to
changes
in
behavior
phenotypes
.

However
,
epigenetics
has
a
reversible
nature
since
it
is
based
on
the
addition
or
removal
of
chemical
residues
,
and
thus
the
original
epigenetic
status
may
be
restored
.

Indeed
,
several
antidepressants
and
anticonvulsants
used
for
mental
disorders
including
ASDs
restore
the
epigenetic
state
and
gene
expression
.

Therefore
,
further
epigenetic
understanding
of
ASDs
is
important
for
the
development
of
new
drugs
that
take
advantages
of
epigenetic
reversibility
.

Background

Mesenchymal

cellular
therapy

are
classified
as

and
their
production
must
fulfill
the
requirements
of
Good

Practice
(

rules
.

Despite
their
classification
as
medicinal
products
is
already
well
recognized
,
there
is
still
a
lack
of
information
and
indications
to
validate
methods
and
to
adapt
the
noncompendial
and
compendial
methods
to
these
peculiar
biological
products
with
intrinsic
characteristics
that
differentiate
them
from
classic
synthetic
or
biologic
drugs
.

In
the
present
paper
,
we
present
the
results
of
the
validation
studies
performed
in
the
context
of
MSC

Our
work
demonstrates
that
it
is
possible
to
fully
validate
analytical
methods
also
for
ATMPs
and
that
a
risk-based
approach
can
fill
the
gap
between
the
prescription
of
the
available
guidelines
shaped
on
traditional
medicinal
products
and
the
peculiar

of
these
novel

Background
:
Based
on
clinical
representation
of
disease
symptoms
multiple
sclerosis
(
MScl
)
patients
can
be
divided
into
two
major
subtypes
;
relapsing
remitting
(
RR
)
MScl
(
85-90
%
)
and
primary
progressive
(
PP
)
MScl
(
10-15
%
)
.

Proteomics
analysis
of
cerebrospinal
fluid
(
CSF
)
has
detected
a
number
of
proteins
that
were
elevated
in
MScl
patients
.

Here
we
specifically
aimed
to
differentiate
between
the
PP
and
RR
subtypes
of
MScl
by
comparing
CSF
proteins
.

Methodology/Principal
Findings
:
CSF
samples
(
n
=

)
were
handled
according
to
the
same
protocol
for
quantitative
mass
spectrometry
measurements
we
reported
previously
.

In
the
comparison
of
PP
MScl
versus
RR
MScl
we
observed
a
number
of
differentially
abundant
proteins
,
such
as
protein
jagged-1
and
vitamin
D-binding
protein
.

Protein
jagged-1
was
over
three
times
less
abundant
in
PP
MScl
compared
to
RR
MScl
.

Vitamin
D-binding
protein
was
only
detected
in
the
RR
MScl
samples
.

These
two
proteins
were
validated
by
independent
techniques

and
ELISA

types
.

Background
:
The
recent
Ebola
Virus
Disease
(
EVD
)
epidemic
that
hit
some
countries
in
West
Africa
underscores
the
need
to
train
front
line
high-risk
health
workers
on
disease
prevention
skills
.

Although
Ghana
did
not
record
(
and
is
yet
to
)
any
case
,
and
several
health
workers
have
received
numerous
training
schemes
,
there
is
no
record
of
any
study
that
assessed
preparedness
of
healthcare
workers
(
HCWS
)
regarding
EVD
and
any
emergency
prone
disease
in
Ghana
.

We
therefore
conducted
a
hospital
based
cross
sectional
study
involving
101
HCWs
from
two
facilities
in
Kumasi
,
Ghana
to
assess
the
level
of
preparedness
of
HCWs
to
respond
to
any
possible
EVD
.

Methods
:
We
administered
a
face-to-face
questionnaire
using
an
adapted
WHO
(
2015
)
and
CDC
(
2014
)
Checklist
for
Ebola
Preparedness
and
assessed
overall
knowledge
gaps
,
and
preparedness
of
the
Ghanaian
HCWs
in
selected
health
facilities
of
the
Ashanti
Region
of
Ghana
from
October
to
December
2015
.

Results
:
A
total
92
(
91.09
%
)
HCWs
indicated
they
were
not
adequately
trained
to
handle
an
EVD
suspected
case
.

Only
25.74
%
(
n
=
26
)
considered
their
facilities
sufficiently
equipped
to
handle
and
manage
EVD
patients
.

When
asked
which
disinfectant
to
use
after
attending
to
and
caring
for
a
suspected
patient
with
EVD
,
only
8.91
%
(
n
=
9
)
could
correctly
identify
the
right
disinfectant
(
χ
2
=
28.52
,
p
=
0.001
)
.

Conclusion
:
Our
study
demonstrates
poor
knowledge
and
ill
preparedness
and
unwillingness
of
many
HCWs
to
attend
to
EVD
.

Beyond
knowledge
acquisition
,
there
is
the
need
for
more
training
from
time
to
time
to
fully
prepare
HCWs
to
handle
any
possible
EVD
case
.

Background
:
Acute
respiratory
infection
(
ARI
)
is
a
leading
cause
of
morbidity
and
mortality
in
children
worldwide
.

This
study
aimed
to
determine
the
viral
and
atypical
bacterial
causes
of
different
severities
and
clinical
manifestations
of
ARI
in
preschool
children
from
low-income
families
in
North-East
Brazil
.

Methods
:
Clinical/demographic
data
and
nasopharyngeal
aspirates
(
NPA
)
were
prospectively
collected
from
children
,5
years
presenting
with
ARI
over
one
year
to
a
paediatric
A
&
E
department
.

Disease
severity
was
grouped
according
to
presence
of
lower
respiratory
tract
signs
,
need
for
hospital
admission
and
need
for
oxygen
.

Clinical
manifestation
of
ARI
was
based
on
discharge
diagnosis
from
hospital
with
four
conditions
predominating
:
bronchiolitis
,
pneumonia
,
episodic
viral
wheeze/asthma
and
upper
respiratory
tract
infection
.

Multiplex
PCR
was
used
to
detect
17
common
respiratory
viral
and
atypical
bacterial
pathogens
in
NPA
.

Findings
:
407
children
with
a
median
age
of
eight
months
were
recruited
.

Pathogens
were
detected
in
85
?
5
%
samples
with
co-infection
being
particularly
common
(
39
?
5
%
)
.

Respiratory
Syncytial
Virus
(
RSV
;
37

)
,
Adenoviruses
(
AdV
;
25
%
)
,
Rhinoviruses
(

)
,
Bocavirus
(

;
19
%
)
,
human
Meta-pneumovirus
(
hMPV
;
10
%
)
and
Mycoplasma
pneumoniae
(
Mpp
;
10
%
)
were
most
prevalent
.

Detection
and
co-infection
rates
were
similar
in
all
severities
and
clinical
manifestations
of
ARI
apart
from
RSV
,
which
was
associated
with
more
severe
disease
and
specifically
more
severe
cases
of
bronchiolitis
,
and
Mpp
,
which
was
associated
with
more
severe
cases
of
pneumonia
.

Mpp
was
detected
in
17
%
of
children
admitted
to
hospital
with
pneumonia
.

Interpretation
:
This
study
underlines
the
importance
of
viral
and
atypical
bacterial
pathogens
in
ARI
in
pre-school
children
and
highlights
the
complex
epidemiology
of
these
pathogens
in
this
age
group
.

Generally
,
viruses
and
atypical
bacteria
were
detected
in
all
severities
and
clinical
manifestations
of
ARI
but
RSV
and
Mpp
were
associated
with
more
severe
cases
of
bronchiolitis
and
pneumonia
respectively
.

Introduction
:
Healthcare
workers
(
HCW
)
are
exposed
to
infectious
agents
.

Disease
surveillance
is
therefore
needed
in
order
to
foster
prevention
.

The
data
of
the
compensation
board
that
covers
HCWs
of
non-governmental
healthcare
providers
in
Germany
was
analysed
for
a
five-year
period
.

For
hepatitis
B
virus
(
HBV
)
and
hepatitis
C
virus
(
HCV
)
infections
,
the
period
analysed
was
extended
to
the
last
15
years
.

The
annual
rate
of
occupational
infectious
diseases
(
OIDs
)
per
100,000
employees
was
calculated
.

For
needlestick
injuries
(
NSI
)
a
rate
per
1,000
employees
was
calculated
.

Results
:
Within
the
five
years
from
2005
to
2009
a
total
of
384
HCV
infections
were
recognised
as
OIDs
(
1.5/100,000
employees
)
.

Active
TB
was
the
second
most
frequent
cause
of
an
OID
.

While
the
numbers
of
HBV
and
HCV
infections
decreased
,
the
numbers
for
active
TB
did
not
follow
a
clear
pattern
.

Needlestick
injuries
(
NSIs
)
were
reported
especially
often
at
hospitals
(
29.9/1,000
versus
7.4/1,000
employees
for
all
other
HCWs
)
.

Conclusion
:
Although
they
are
declining
,
HCV
infections
remain
frequent
in
HCWs
,
as
do
NSIs
.

Whether
the
reinforcement
of
the
recommendations
for
the
use
of
safety
devices
in
Germany
will
prevent
NSIs
and
therefore
HCV
infections
should
be
closely
observed
.

Pre-existing
immunity
to
human
adenovirus
serotype
5
(
Ad5
)
is
common
in
the
general
population
.

Bypassing
pre-existing
immunity
could
maximize
Ad5
vaccine
efficacy
.

Vaccination
by
the
intramuscular
(
I.M
.

)
,
nasal
(
I.N
.
)

or
oral
(
P.O
.
)

route
with
Ad5
expressing
Ebola
Zaire
glycoprotein
(
Ad5-ZGP
)
fully
protected
naïve
mice
against
lethal
challenge
with
Ebola
.

In
the
presence
of
pre-existing
immunity
,
only
mice
vaccinated
I.N
.

survived
.

The
frequency
of
IFN-c+
CD8+
T
cells
was
reduced
by
80
%
and
by
15
%
in
animals
vaccinated
by
the
I.M
.

and
P.O
.

routes
respectively
.

Neutralizing
antibodies
could
not
be
detected
in
serum
from
either
treatment
group
.

Pre-existing
immunity
did
not
compromise
the
frequency
of
IFN-c+
CD8+
T
cells
(
3.961
%
naïve
vs.
3.661
%
pre-existing
immunity
,
PEI
)
nor
anti-Ebola
neutralizing
antibody
(
NAB
,
40610
reciprocal
dilution
,
both
groups
)
.

The
number
of
INF-c+
CD8+
cells
detected
in
bronchioalveolar
lavage
fluid
(
BAL
)
after
I.N
.

immunization
was
not
compromised
by
pre-existing
immunity
to
Ad5
(
146614
,
naïve
vs.
120616
SFC/million
MNCs
,
PEI
)
.

However
,
pre-existing
immunity
reduced
NAB
levels
in
BAL
by
,25
%
in
this
group
.

To
improve
the
immune
response
after
oral
vaccination
,
the
Ad5-based
vaccine
was
PEGylated
.

Mice
given
the
modified
vaccine
did
not
survive
challenge
and
had
reduced
levels
of
IFN-c+
CD8+
T
cells
10
days
after
administration
(
0.360.3
%
PEG
vs.
1.760.5
%
unmodified
)
.

PEGylation
did
increase
NAB
levels
2-fold
.

These
results
provide
some
insight
about
the
degree
of
T
and
B
cell
mediated
immunity
necessary
for
protection
against
Ebola
virus
and
suggest
that
modification
of
the
virus
capsid
can
influence
the
type
of
immune
response
elicited
by
an
Ad5-based
vaccine
.

Zika
virus
(
ZIKV
)
infection
is
currently
one
of
the
major
concerns
in
human
public
health
due
to
its
association
with
neurological
disorders
.

Intensive
effort
has
been
implemented
for
the
treatment
of
ZIKV
,
however
there
are
not
currently
approved
vaccines
or
antivirals
available
to
combat
ZIKV
infection
.

In
this
sense
,
the
identification
of
virulence
factors
associated
with
changes
in
ZIKV
virulence
could
help
to
develop
safe
and
effective
countermeasures
to
treat
ZIKV
or
to
prevent
future
outbreaks
.

Here
,
we
have
compared
the
virulence
of
two
related
ZIKV
strains
from
the
recent
outbreak
in
Brazil
(
2015
)
,
Rio
Grande
do
Norte
Natal
(
RGN
)
and
Paraiba
.

In
spite
of
both
viruses
being
identified
in
the
same
period
of
time
and
region
,
significant
differences
in
virulence
and
replication
were
observed
using
a
validated
mouse
model
of
ZIKV
infection
.

While
ZIKV-RGN
has
a
50
%
mouse
lethal
dose
(
MLD
50
)
of
~10
5
focus
forming
units
(
FFUs
)
,
ZIKV-Paraiba
infection
resulted
in
100
%
of
lethality
with
less
than
10
FFUs
.

Combining
deep-sequencing
analysis
and
our
previously
described
infectious
ZIKV-RGN
cDNA
clone
,
we
identified
a
natural
polymorphism
in
the
non-structural
protein
2
A
(
NS2A
)
that
increase
the
virulence
of
ZIKV
.

Moreover
,
results
demonstrate
that
the
single
amino
acid
alanine
to
valine
substitution
at
position
117
(
A117V
)
in
the
NS2A
was
sufficient
to
convert
the
attenuated
rZIKV-RGN
in
a
virulent
Paraiba-like
virus
(
MLD
50
<
10
FFU
)
.

The
mechanism
of
action
was
also
evaluated
and
data
indicate
that
substitution
A117V
in
ZIKV
NS2A
protein
reduces
host
innate
immune
responses
and
viralinduced
apoptosis
in
vitro
.

Therefore
,
amino
acid
substitution
A117V
in
ZIKV
NS2A
could
be
used
as
a
genetic
risk-assessment
marker
for
future
ZIKV
outbreaks
.

Zika
virus
(
ZIKV
)
is
an
emerging
mosquito-borne
flavivirus
,
which
became
a
global
public
concern
due
to
its
association
with
an
increase
in
congenital
microcephaly
cases
in
Brazil
in
2015
1
.

ZIKV
was
first
isolated
in
1947
from
a
sentinel
rhesus
monkey
in
the
Zika
forest
of
Uganda
2
.

ZIKV
infection
in
humans
was
first
described
during
a
jaundice
epidemic
in
Nigeria
in
1954
3
and
only
sporadic
cases
of
ZIKV
infection
in
humans
have
been
reported
in
Africa
and
Asia
over
the
last
century
4-8
.

It
was
not
until
2007
,
when
ZIKV
caused
the
first
outbreak
on
Yap
Island
in
the
Federated
States
of
Micronesia
with
almost
75
%
of
the
population
showing
signs
of
infection
9
.

ZIKV
was
historically
associated
with
a
mild
febrile
illness
,
which
is
similar
to
that
caused
by
other
mosquito-borne
diseases
of
public
relevance
such
as
Dengue
virus
(
DENV
)
,
Yellow
fever
virus
(
YFV
)
or
Chikungunya
virus
(
CHIKV
)
10
.

The
similarity
of
the
clinical
signs
of
ZIKV
disease
with
those
of
DENV
or
CHIKV
has
interfered
with
ZIKV
diagnosis
and
most
probably
underestimated
the
number
of
cases
of
ZIKV
infections
11
.

However
,
ZIKV
has
become
a
major
human
health
concern
due
to
its
association
with
severe
neurological
complications
,
including
an
increased
risk
of
Guillain-Barré
syndrome
in
adults
during
the
large
outbreak
in
French
Polynesia
in
2013-2014
12,13
and
a
dramatic
increase
in
severe
congenital
malformations
,
including
fetal
microcephaly
in
neonates
during
the
massive
epidemic
that
emerged
in
Brazil
in
2015

]
[
15
]
[
16
]
[
17
]
[
18
]
[
19
]
.

Since
then
,
millions
of
infected
individuals
have
been
reported
in
South
and
Central
America
,
the
Caribbean
and
the
South
of
United
States
20-22
.

ZIKV
is
primarily
transmitted
through
the
bite
of
an
infected
Aedes
spp
.

mosquito
(
Aedes
aegypti
and
Aedes
albopictus
)
6,23-25
.

However
,
non-vector
ZIKV
transmission
has
been
reported
to
occur
by
vertical
transmission
from
mother
to
child
14
,
26
,
27
and
by
sexual
transmission
25,28-30
.

In
addition
,
ZIKV
RNA
has
been
detected
in
body
fluids
including
blood
,
urine
,
semen
,
saliva
and
breast
milk
,
increasing
the
risk
of
a
human
to
human
transmission
via
direct

ZIKV
is
a
positive
single-stranded
RNA
virus
with
a
genome
of
about
10.8
kb
that
contains
a
cap
structure
at
the
5′-end
and
a
single
open
reading
frame
(
ORF
)
flanked
by
two
5′
and
3′
untranslated
regions
(
UTRs
)
33,34
.

The
ORF
encodes
a
single
polyprotein
of
approximately
3,424
amino
acids
that
is
co-and
post-translationally
processed
by
viral
and
cellular
proteases
to
produce
three
structural
proteins
,
capsid
(
C
)
,
pre-membrane
(
prM
)
and
envelope
(
E
)
,
and
seven
non-structural
(

proteins
(

,
NS2A
,
NS2B
,
NS3
,
NS4A
,
NS4B
and
NS5
)
33,34
.

Phylogenetic
analyses
of
ZIKV
genomes
have
identified
two
major
genetic
lineages
,
African
and
Asian
35
.

ZIKV
strains
from
the
recent
epidemic
in
the
Americas
are
phylogenetically
related
to
the
Asian
lineage

.

The
molecular
determinants
of
ZIKV
evolution
,
spread
,
virulence
,
and
disease
have
not
been
totally
established
.

It
has
been
postulated
that
ZIKV
genome
changes
may
have
evolved
to
modify
tissue
tropism
,
becoming
more
neurotrophic
8,38-41
,
and/or
more
efficiently
transmitted
to
humans
8,32,42-44
,
but
the
virulence
factors
associated
with
ZIKV
pathogenesis
remain
unknown
.

During
the
last
years
,
extensive
efforts
have
been
made
to
develop
in
vitro
and
in
vivo
approaches
to
study
ZIKV
infection
and
pathogenesis
,
including
reverse
genetic
systems
34
and
suitable
animal
models
of
infection
45
.

In
this
sense
,
the
emergence
of
ZIKV
has
promoted
the
rapid
development
of
numerous
reverse
genetic
approaches
34
,
which
constitute
an
essential
tool
for
research
to
generate
recombinant
viruses
containing
specific
substitutions
to
evaluate
their
contribution
in
viral
replication
or
transcription
,
pathogenicity
,
virus-host
interaction
,
viral
tropism
and
transmissibility
[

[

]
[

]
.

Recently
,
we
have
developed
a
reverse
genetic
approach
based
on
the
use
of
a
bacterial
artificial
chromosome
(
BAC
)
to
assemble
the
full-length
cDNA
of
the
viral
genome
of
ZIKV
Rio
Grande
do
Norte
Natal
(
RGN
)
strain
(
Brazil
,
2015
)
49
.

On
the
other
hand
,
animal
models
are
essential
to
understand
the
biology
and
pathogenesis
of
ZIKV
.

It
is
known
that
infection
of
immunocompetent
mice
results
in
little
to
no
virus
production
,
and
infected
mice
do
not
develop
disease
50
.

However
,
mice
with
deficiencies
in
the
interferon
(
IFN
)
signaling
pathway
display
enhanced
susceptibility
to
infection
by
ZIKV
and
other
flaviviruses
,
and
they
recapitulate
many
of
the
symptoms
associated
with
infections
in
humans
45,51-54
.

Therefore
,
these
animal
models
are
currently
used
to
study
ZIKV
infection
in
vivo
,
including
the
development
of
new
therapeutic
approaches
to
combat
and/or
prevent
ZIKV
infections
24
,
45
,
50
,
52
,
55
.

In
the
present
study
,
we
have
analyzed
the
virulence
of
ZIKV-RGN
and
Paraiba
,
two
viral
strains
that
have
been
identified
from
the
recent
outbreak
in
Brazil
in
2015
.

Using
the
validated
type-I
IFN
receptor
deficient
(
IFNAR−/−
)
A129
mice
model
of
ZIKV
infection
,
we
have
observed
that
ZIKV-Paraiba
is
more
virulent
and
replicates
to
higher
levels
compared
to
rZIKV-RGN
.

Combining
deep-sequencing
analysis
and
reverse
genetic
systems
,
we
have
identified
a
single
amino
acid
polymorphism
at
position
117
in
the
viral
protein
NS2A
responsible
for
the
differences
in
virulence
between
both
ZIKV
strains
.

This
polymorphism
(
A117V
)
in
ZIKV
NS2A
affects
host
innate
immune
responses
and
viral-induced
apoptosis
,
and
,
therefore
,
represents
an
important
viral
genetic
marker
for
risk-assessment
to
prevent
future
ZIKV
outbreaks

For

The
initial
interaction
between
viral
attachment
proteins
and
the
host
cell
is
a
critical
determinant
for
the
susceptibility
of
a
host
for
a
particular
virus
.

To
increase
our
understanding
of
avian
pathogens
and
the
susceptibility
of
poultry
species
,
we
developed
novel
avian
tissue
microarrays
(
TMAs
)
.

Tissue
binding
profiles
of
avian
viral
attachment
proteins
were
studied
by
performing
histochemistry
on
multi-species
TMA
,
comprising
of
selected
tissues
from
ten
avian
species
,
and
single-species
TMAs
,
grouping
organ
systems
of
each
species
together
.

The
attachment
pattern
of
the
hemagglutinin
protein
was
in
line
with
the
reported
tropism
of
influenza
virus
H5N1
,
confirming
the
validity
of
TMAs
in
profiling
the
initial
virus-host
interaction
.

The
previously
believed
chicken-specific
coronavirus
(
CoV
)
M41
spike
(
S1
)
protein
displayed
a
broad
attachment
pattern
to
respiratory
tissues
of
various
avian
species
,
albeit
with
lower
affinity
than
hemagglutinin
,
suggesting
that
other
avian
species
might
be
susceptible
for
chicken
CoV
.

When
comparing
tissue-specific
binding
patterns
of
various
avian
coronaviral
S1
proteins
on
the
single-species
TMAs
,
chicken
and
partridge
CoV
S1
had
predominant
affinity
for
the
trachea
,
while
pigeon
CoV
S1
showed
marked
preference
for
lung
of
their
respective
hosts
.

Binding
of
all
coronaviral
S1
proteins
was
dependent
on
sialic
acids
;
however
,
while
chicken
CoV
S1
preferred
sialic
acids
type
I
lactosamine
(
Gal

)
GlcNAc
)
over
type
II
(
Gal
(
1-4
)
GlcNAc
)
,
the
fine
glycan
specificities
of
pigeon
and
partridge
CoVs
were
different
,
as
chicken
CoV
S1-specific
sialylglycopolymers
could
not
block
their
binding
to
tissues
.

Taken
together
,
TMAs
provide
a
novel
platform
in
the
field
of
infectious
diseases
to
allow
identification
of
binding
specificities
of
viral
attachment
proteins
and
are
helpful
to
gain
insight
into
the
susceptibility
of
host
and
organ
for
avian
pathogens
.

In
the
model

Podospora
anserina

the
PaYIP3
gene
encoding
the
orthologue
of
the
Saccharomyces
cerevisiae
YIP3
Rab-GDI
complex
dissociation
factor
expresses
two
polypeptides
,
one
of
which
,
the
long
form
,
is
produced
through
a
programmed
translation
frameshift
.

Inactivation
of
PaYIP3
results
in
slightly
delayed
growth
associated
with
modification
in
repartition
of
fruiting
body
on
the
thallus
,
along
with
reduced
ascospore
production

Long
and
short
forms

for
the

in

,
for
example
,
those
on

(
ECMO
)
.

However
,
data
on
the
clinical
outcomes
of
such
patients
is
limited
.

Case
presentation
:
We
report
the
clinical
outcomes
of
four
patients
who
were
admitted
at
the
intensive
care
unit
during
the
2017-2018
influenza
season
with
severe
sepsis
(
SOFA
score
>
11
)
and
acute
respiratory
distress
syndrome
requiring
ECMO
and
mechanical
ventilation
.

Two
patients
were
immune-compromised
.

The
A
(
H1N1
)
pdm09
genome
was
confirmed
by
polymerase
chain
reaction
(
PCR
)
on
nasopharyngeal
specimen
swabs
prior
to
administration
of
IV
zanamivir
at
a
dose
of
600
mg
twice
daily
.

Weekly
qualitative
PCR
analysis
was
done
to
monitor
viral
clearance
,
with
zanamivir
treatment
being
discontinued
upon
receipt
of
negative
results
.

In
addition
,
the
patients
were
managed
for
concomitant
multidrug-resistant
bacterial
infections
,
with
infection
resolution
confirmed
with
blood
cultures
.

The
median
time
for
zanamivir
treatment
was
10
days
(
IQR
10-17
)
.

The
clinical
outcome
was
favourable
with
all
four
patients
surviving
and
improving
clinically
.

All
four
patients
achieved
viral
clearance
of
A
(
H1N1
)
pdm09
genome
,
and
resolution
of
multidrug-resistant
bacterial
infections
.

Conclusions
:
IV
zanamivir
could
be
a
good
therapeutic
option
in
patients
with
severe
influenza
A
(
H1N1
)
pdm09
infection
who
are
unable
to
take
oral
or
aerosolised
antiviral
medication
.

We
recommend
prospective
randomized
control
trials
to
support
this
hypothesis
.

Chlamydiae
may
exist
at
the
site
of
infection
in
an
alternative
replicative
form
,
called
the
aberrant
body
(
AB
)
.

ABs
are
produced
during
a
viable
but
non-infectious
developmental
state
termed
``
persistence
''
or
``
chlamydial
stress
.
''

As
persistent/stressed
chlamydiae
:
(
i
)
may
contribute
to
chronic
inflammation
observed
in
diseases
like
trachoma
;
and
(
ii
)
are
more
resistant
to
current
anti-chlamydial
drugs
of
choice
,
it
is
critical
to
better
understand
this
developmental
stage
.

We
previously
demonstrated
that
porcine
epidemic
diarrhea
virus
(
PEDV
)
co-infection
induced
Chlamydia
pecorum
persistence/stress
in
culture
.

One
critical
characteristic
of
persistence/stress
is
that
the
chlamydiae
remain
viable
and
can
reenter
the
normal
developmental
cycle
when
the
stressor
is
removed
.

Thus
,
we
hypothesized
that
PEDV-induced
persistence
would
be
reversible
if
viral
replication
was
inhibited
.

Therefore
,
we
performed
time
course
experiments
in
which
Vero
cells
were
C.
pecorum/PEDV
infected
in
the
presence
of
cycloheximide
(
CHX
)
,
which
inhibits
viral
but
not
chlamydial
protein
synthesis
.

CHX-exposure
inhibited
PEDV
replication
,
but
did
not
inhibit
induction
of
C.
pecorum
persistence
at
24
h
post-PEDV
infection
,
as
indicated
by
AB
formation
and
reduced
production
of
infectious
EBs
.

Interestingly
,
production
of
infectious
EBs
resumed
when
CHX-exposed
,
co-infected
cells
were
incubated
48-72
h
post-PEDV
co-infection
.

These
data
demonstrate
that
PEDV
co-infection-induced
chlamydial
persistence/stress
is
reversible
and
suggest
that
this
induction
(
i
)
does
not
require
viral
replication
in
host
cells
;
and
(
ii
)
does
not
require
de
novo
host
or
viral
protein
synthesis
.

These
data
also
suggest
that
viral
binding
and/or
entry
may
be
required
for
this
effect
.

Because
the
PEDV
host
cell
receptor
(
CD13
or
aminopeptidase
N
)
stimulates
cellular
signaling
pathways
in
the
absence
of
PEDV
infection
,
we
suspect
that
PEDV
co-infection
might
alter
CD13
function
and
induce
the
chlamydiae
to
enter
the
persistent
state
.

beneficial
for

Results
:
At

one
of
these

were
identified
in

We
established
that
combined
with

The
high

illustrates
the
complexities
in
attributing
causality
to
specific
viruses
in
the
aetiology
of

may
indicate

Background
:
Iron
is
an
essential
nutrient
,
and
iron
supplementation
has
been
shown
to
reduce
the
incidence
of
abomasal
bloat
in
lambs
.

Additionally
,
iron
deficiency
is
linked
to
pica
,
which
may
increase
uptake
of
Eimeria
oocysts
.

Coccidiosis
in
sheep
,
caused
by
Eimeria
spp.
,
is
an
important
infection
,
leading
to
reduced
welfare
and
economic
losses
.

The
aims
of
our
study
were
to
investigate
:
(
1
)
the
use
of
iron
supplementation
in
Norwegian
sheep
flocks
using
a
questionnaire
survey
,
and
(
2
)
whether
iron
supplementation
reduced
excretion
of
Eimeria
oocysts
and
increased
the
growth
rates
of
young
lambs
.

A
questionnaire
regarding
the
use
of
iron
supplementation
,
sent
to
all
members
of
the
Norwegian
Sheep
Recording
System
(
n
=
4993
)
,
showed
that
152/1823
farmers
iron-supplemented
lambs
,
either
orally
(
56.7
%
)
or
by
injection
(
43.3
%
)
.

The
main
purpose
of
supplementation
was
to
prevent
abomasal
bloat
(
38.4
%
)
,
coccidiosis
(
9.3
%
)
,
or
both
(
27.8
%
)
.

In
the
field
study
,
102
twin
lambs
from
five
flocks
were
included
:
one
twin
(
treated
)
received
600
mg
of
gleptoferron
subcutaneously
within
3
days
of
birth
,
whereas
the
control
was
given
saline
.

McMaster
analysis
of
individual
faecal
samples
obtained
at
weekly
intervals
(
n
=
4
per
lamb
,
starting
at
turnout
)
showed
no
significant
difference
in
oocyst
excretion
between
treatment
groups
at
any
sampling
,
except
for
one
flock
14
days
after
turnout
.

Mean
growth
rates
,
measured
at
iron
injection
,
21
days
after
turnout
,
and
in
the
autumn
,
differed
significantly
between
treated
and
untreated
lambs
from
iron
injection
to
21
days
after
turnout
,
however
,
no
difference
in
growth
rates
was
observed
in
the
overall
period
from
iron
injection
to
autumn
.

Blood
analysis
suggested
that
the
controls
were
at
risk
of
developing
iron
deficiency
anaemia
during
the
housed
period
,
but
signs
of
anaemia
were
not
observed
.

Conclusion
:
Iron
supplementation
of
lambs
was
used
by
8.3
%
of
the
farmers
responding
to
the
questionnaire
,
mainly
with
the
intention
to
prevent
abomasal
bloat
,
coccidiosis
,
or
both
.

The
field
trial
results
indicate
that
iron
supplementation
of
young
lambs
do
not
reduce
oocyst
excretion
and
only
induced
a
transitory
increase
in
weight
gain
.

However
further
studies
,
including
more
flocks
and
possibly
repeated
iron
injections
,
would
provide
more
definitive
information
.

Purpose
:
Malignant
melanoma
's
(
MM
)
incidence
is
rising
faster
than
that
of
any
other
cancer
in
the
US
and
the
overall
survival
at
5
years
is
less
than
10
%
.

B
cell
associated
protein
31
(
BAP31
)
is
overexpressed
in
most
MMs
and
might
be
a
promising
target
for
immunotherapy
of
this
disease
.

Experimental
design
:
Firstly
,
we
investigated
the
expression
profiles
of
human
BAP31
(
hBAP31
)
and
mouse
BAP31
(
mBAP31
)
in
human
and
mouse
normal
tissues
,
respectively
.

The
expression
level
of
hBAP31
in
human
MMs
and
mBAP31
in
B16
melanoma
cells
was
also
analyzed
.

Then
we
constructed
novel
mBAP31
DNA
vaccines
and
tested
there
ability
to
stimulate
mBAP31-specific
immune
responses
and
antitumor
immunity
in
B16
melanoma-bearing
mice
.

Results
:
For
the
first
time
,
we
found
that
protein
expression
of
hBAP31
were
dramatically
upregulated
in
human
MMs
when
compared
with
human
normal
tissues
.

Predominant
protein
expression
of
mBAP31
was
found
in
mouse
B16
melanoma
cells
but
not
in
mouse
important
organs
.

When
mice
were
immunized
with
mBAP31
DNA
vaccines
,
strong
cellular
response
to
mBAP31
was
observed
in
the
vaccinated
mice
.

CTLs
isolated
from
immunized
mice
could
effectively
kill
mBAP31-positive
target
mouse
B16
melanoma
tumor
cells
in
vitro
and
vaccination
with
mBAP31
DNA
vaccines
had
potent
anti-tumor
activity
in
therapeutic
model
using
B16
melanoma
cells
.

Conclusions
:
These
are
the
first
data
supporting
a
vaccine
targeting
BAP31
that
is
capable
of
inducing
effective
immunity
against
BAP31-expressing
MMs
and
will
be
applicable
to
human

Many
long
non-coding
RNAs
(
lncRNAs
)
are
expressed
in
cells
but
only
a
few
have
been
well
characterized
.

In
these
cases
,
lncRNAs
have
been
shown
to
be
key
regulators
of
several
cellular
processes
.

Therefore
,
there
is
a
great
need
to
understand
the
function
of
more
lncRNAs
and
their
regulation
in
response
to
stimuli
.

Interferon
(
IFN
)
is
a
key
molecule
in
the
cellular
antiviral
response
.

IFN
binding
to
its
receptor
activates
transcription
of
several
IFN-stimulated
genes
(
ISGs
)
that
function
as
potent
antivirals
.

In
addition
,
several
ISGs
are
positive
or
negative
regulators
of
the
IFN
pathway
.

This
is
essential
to
ensure
a
strong
antiviral
response
and
a
later
return
of
the
cell
to
homeostasis
.

As
the
ISGs
described
to
date
are
coding
genes
,
we
sought
to
determine
whether
IFN
also
regulates
the
expression
of
long
non-coding
ISGs
.

To
this
aim
,
we
used
RNA
sequencing
to
analyze
the
transcriptome
of
control
and
HuH7
cells
treated
with
IFNα2
.

The
results
show
that
IFN-treatment
regulates
the
expression
of
several
unknown
non-coding
transcripts
.

We
have
validated
two
lncRNAs
upregulated
after
treatment
with
different
doses
of
type
I
IFNα2
in
different
cells
or
with
type
III
IFNλ
.

These
lncRNAs
were
also
induced
by
influenza
and
vesicular
stomatitis
virus
mutants
unable
to
block
the
IFN
response
,
but
not
by
several
wild-type
lytic
viruses
tested.These
lncRNA
genes
were
named
lncISG15
and
lncBST2
as
they
are
located
close
to
ISGs
ISG15
and
BST2
,
respectively
.

Interestingly
,
inhibition
experiments
showed
that
lncBST2
is
a
positive
regulator
of
BST2
.

Therefore
lncBST2
has
been
renamed
BISPR
,
from
BST2
IFN-stimulated
positive
regulator
.

Our
results
may
have
therapeutic
implications
as
lncBST2/BISPR
,
but
also
lncISG15
and
their
coding
neighbors
,
are
increased
in
cells
infected
with
hepatitis
C
virus
and
in
the
liver
of
infected
patients
.

These
results
allow
us
to
hypothesize
that
several
lncRNAs
could
be
activated
by
IFN
to
control
the
potency
of
the
antiviral
IFN
response

On
17
September
2015
,
Buliisa
District
Health
Office
reported
multiple
deaths
due
to
haemorrhage
to
the
Uganda
Ministry
of
Health
.

We
conducted
an
investigation
to
verify
the
existence
of
an
outbreak
and
to
identify
the
disease
nature
,
mode
of
transmission
and
risk
factors
.

Methods
:
We
defined
a
suspected
case
as
onset
of
hematemesis
between
1
June
2015
and
15
October
2015
in
a
resident
of
Hoima
,
Buliisa
or
neighbouring
districts
.

We
identified
cases
by
reviewing
medical
records
and
actively
searching
in
the
community
.

We
interviewed
casepatients
and
health-care
workers
and
performed
descriptive
epidemiology
to
generate
hypotheses
on
possible
exposures
.

In
a
case-control
study
we
compared
exposures
between
21
cases
and
81
controls
,
matched
by
age
(
±
10
years
)
,
sex
and
village
of
residence
.

We
collected
22
biological
specimens
from
19
case-patients
to
test
for
Viral
Haemorrhagic
Fevers
(
VHF
)
.

We
analysed
the
data
using
the
Mantel-Haenszel
method
to
account
for
the
matched
study
design
.

Results
:
We
identified
56
cases
with
onset
from
June
to
October
(
attack
rate
15/100,000
in
Buliisa
District
and
5.2/100,000
in
Hoima
District
)
.

The
age-specific
attack
rate
was
highest
in
persons
aged
31-60
years
(
15/100,000
in
Hoima
and
47/100,000
in
Buliisa
)
;
no
persons
below
15
years
of
age
had
the
illness
.

In
the
case-control
study
,
42
%
(
5/12
)
of
cases
vs.
0.0
%
(

vs.
14
%
(

to
disease
onset
(

)
.

None
of
the
blood
samples
were
positive
for
any
of
the
VHFs
.

Conclusion
:
This
reported
cluster
of
hematemesis
illness
was
due
to
predisposing
conditions
and
use
of
Non-Steroidal
Anti-inflammatory
Drugs
(
NSAID
)
.

Health
education
should
be
conducted
on
the
danger
of
NSAIDs
misuse
,
especially
in
persons
with
predisposing
conditions
.

Human
coronaviruses
(
HCoV
)
OC43
,
229E
,
NL63
,
and
HKU1
are
common
respiratory
viruses
which
cause
various
respiratory
diseases
,
including
pneumonia
.

There
is
a
paucity
of
evidence
on
the
epidemiology
and
clinical
manifestations
of
these
four
HCoV
strains
worldwide
.

We
collected
11,399
throat
swabs
from
hospitalized
children
with
acute
respiratory
tract
infection
from
These
were
tested
for
four
strains
of
HCoV
infection
using
real-time
polymerase
chain
reaction
(
PCR
)
.

HCoV-positive
patients
were
then
tested
for
11
other
respiratory
pathogens
.

4.3
%
(
489/11399
)
of
patients
were
positive
for
HCoV
,
of
which
3.0
%
were
positive
for
OC43
(
346/11399
)
,
0.6
%
for
229E
(
65/11399
)
,
0.5
%
for
NL63
(
60/
11399
)
,
and
0.3
%
for
HKU1
(
38/11399
)
.

Patients
aged
7-12
months
had
the
highest
prevalence
of
HCoV
and
OC43
when
compared
with
other
age
groups
(
p
<
0.001
)
.

The
peak
seasons
of
infection
varied
depending
on
the
HCoV
strain
.

Patients
infected
with
a
single
strain
of
HCoV
infection
were
less
likely
to
present
fever
(
≥
38°C
)
(
p
=
0.014
)
and
more
likely
to
present
pulmonary
rales
(
p
=
0.043
)
than
those
co-infected
with
more
than
one
HCoV
strain
or
other
respiratory
pathogens
.

There
were
also
significant
differences
in
the
prevalence
of
certain
symptoms
,
including
coughing
(
p
=
0.032
)
,
pneumonia
(
p
=
0.026
)
,
and
abnormal
pulmonary
rales
(
p
=
0.002
)
according
to
the
strain
of
HCoV
detected
.

This
retrospective
study
of
the
prevalence
of
four
HCoV
strains
and
clinical
signs
among
a
large
population
of
pediatric
patients
in
a
subtropical
region
of
China
provides
further
insight
into
the
epidemiology
and
clinical
features
of
HCoV
.

Human
respiratory
syncytial
virus
(
hRSV
)
and
human
metapneumovirus
(
hMPV
)
,
two
members
of
the
Pneumoviridae
family
,
account
for
the
majority
of
severe
lower
respiratory
tract
infections
worldwide
in
very
young
children
.

They
are
also
a
frequent
cause
of
morbidity
and
mortality
in
the
elderly
and
immunocompromised
adults
.

High
levels
of
neutralizing
antibodies
,
mostly
directed
against
the
viral
fusion
(
F
)
glycoprotein
,
correlate
with
protection
against
either
hRSV
or
hMPV
.

However
,
no
cross-neutralization
is
observed
in
polyclonal
antibody
responses
raised
after
virus
infection
or
immunization
with
purified
F
proteins
.

Based
on
crystal
structures
of
hRSV
F
and
hMPV
F
,
we
designed
chimeric
F
proteins
in
which
certain
residues
of
well-characterized
antigenic
sites
were
swapped
between
the
two
antigens
.

The
antigenic
changes
were
monitored
by
ELISA
with
virus-specific
monoclonal
antibodies
.

Inoculation
of
mice
with
these
chimeras
induced
polyclonal
cross-neutralizing
antibody
responses
,
and
mice
were
protected
against
challenge
with
the
virus
used
for
grafting
of
the
heterologous
antigenic
site
.

These
results
provide
a
proof
of
principle
for
chimeric
fusion
proteins
as
single
immunogens
that
can
induce
cross-neutralizing
antibody
and
protective
responses
against
more
than
one
human
pneumovirus
.

Background
:
In
the
healthy
central
nervous
system
(
CNS
)
,
microglia
are
found
in
a
homeostatic
state
and
peripheral
macrophages
are
absent
from
the
brain
.

Microglia
play
key
roles
in
maintaining
CNS
homeostasis
and
acting
as
first
responders
to
infection
and
inflammation
,
and
peripheral
macrophages
infiltrate
the
CNS
during
neuroinflammation
.

Due
to
their
distinct
origins
and
functions
,
discrimination
between
these
cell
populations
is
essential
to
the
comprehension
of
neuroinflammatory
disorders
.

Studies
comparing
the
gene
profiles
of
microglia
and
peripheral
macrophages
,
or
macrophages
in
vitro-derived
from
bone
marrow
,
under
non-infectious
conditions
of
the
CNS
,
have
revealed
valuable
microglial-specific
genes
.

However
,
studies
comparing
gene
profiles
between
CNS-infiltrating
macrophages
and
microglia
,
when
both
are
isolated
from
the
CNS
during
viral-induced
neuroinflammation
,
are
lacking
.

Methods
:
We
isolated
,
via
flow
cytometry
,
microglia
and
infiltrating
macrophages
from
the
brains
of
Theiler
's
murine
encephalomyelitis
virus-infected
C57BL/6
J
mice
and
used
RNA-Seq
,
followed
by
validation
with
qPCR
,
to
examine
the
differential
transcriptional
profiles
of
these
cells
.

We
utilized
primary
literature
defining
subcellular
localization
to
determine
whether
or
not
particular
proteins
extracted
from
the
transcriptional
profiles
were
expressed
at
the
cell
surface
.

The
surface
expression
and
cellular
specificity
of
triggering
receptor
expressed
on
myeloid
cells
1
(
TREM-1
)
protein
were
examined
via
flow
cytometry
.

We
also
examined
the
immune
response
gene
profile
within
the
transcriptional
profiles
of
these
isolated
microglia
and
infiltrating
macrophages
.

We
have
identified
and
validated
new
microglial-and
macrophage-specific
genes
,
encoding
cell
surface
proteins
,
expressed
at
the
peak
of
neuroinflammation
.

TREM-1
protein
was
confirmed
to
be
expressed
by
infiltrating
macrophages
,
not
microglia
,
at
the
peak
of
neuroinflammation
.

We
also
identified
both
unique
and
redundant
immune
functions
,
through
examination
of
the
immune
response
gene
profiles
,
of
microglia
and
infiltrating
macrophages
during
neurotropic
viral
infection
.

The
differential
expression
of
cell
surface-specific
genes
during
neuroinflammation
can
potentially
be
used
to
discriminate
between
microglia
and
macrophages
as
well
as
provide
a
resource
that
can
be
further
utilized
to
target
and
manipulate
specific
cell
responses
during
neuroinflammation
.

The
objective
of
the
study
is
to
develop
an
Alignment-free
tool
for
sequence
clustering
.

To
illustrate
the
effectiveness
of
our
method
we
compared
the
distance
matrices
and
the
phylogenetic
trees
generated
by
our
method
with
the
other
freely
available
recent
alignmentfree
tools
[

]
.

The
clustering
efficiency
of
our
tool
can
be
noticed
across
all
the
benchmark
datasets
.

The
phylogenetic
trees
generated
by
our
method
and
the
other
freely
available
recent
methods
shows
superiority
of
our
method
over
the
other
methods
in
terms
of
sequence
clustering
.

The
consistency
can
also
be
seen
from
the
statistical
analysis
such
as
AUC
(
area
under
the
ROC
)
values
calculated
from
ROC
(
Receiver
operating

)
curves
.

AUC
values
are
often
used
to
explain
the
accuracy
of
models
and
not
to
compare
them
.

Accuracy

A
low
AUC
value
does
not
necessarily
imply
a
bad
or
poor
model
;
rather
it
simply
suggests
that
,
besides
the
accounted
predictors
,
other
factors
also
exercise
influence
on
the
response
variable
.

It
is
evident
from
the
ROC
plots
below
that
our
method
's
performance
is
in
good
agreement
with
other
methods
.

The

is
generated
by
a

etc.
,
)
otherwise
we
put
negative

.

We
plotted
the

changing
the

In
a
large-scale
epidemic
outbreak
,
there
can
be
many
high-risk
individuals
to
be
transferred
for
medical
isolation
in
epidemic
areas
.

Typically
,
the
individuals
are
scattered
across
different
locations
,
and
available
quarantine
vehicles
are
limited
.

Therefore
,
it
is
challenging
to
efficiently
schedule
the
vehicles
to
transfer
the
individuals
to
isolated
regions
to
control
the
spread
of
the
epidemic
.

In
this
paper
,
we
formulate
such
a
quarantine
vehicle
scheduling
problem
for
high-risk
individual
transfer
,
which
is
more
difficult
than
most
well-known
vehicle
routing
problems
.

To
efficiently
solve
this
problem
,
we
propose
a
hybrid
algorithm
based
on
the
water
wave
optimization
(
WWO
)
metaheuristic
and
neighborhood
search
.

The
metaheuristic
uses
a
small
population
to
rapidly
explore
the
solution
space
,
and
the
neighborhood
search
uses
a
gradual
strategy
to
improve
the
solution
accuracy
.

Computational
results
demonstrate
that
the
proposed
algorithm
significantly
outperforms
several
existing
algorithms
and
obtains
high-quality
solutions
on
real-world
problem
instances
for
high-risk
individual
transfer
in
Hangzhou
,
China
,
during
the
peak
period
of
the
novel
coronavirus
pneumonia
.

Since
the
first
case
was
diagnosed
on
May
20
,
2015
,
there
were
186
confirmed
cases
of
Middle
East
Respiratory
Syndrome
(
MERS
)
until
the
end
of
outbreak
in
South
Korea
.

Although
medical
institutions
were
the
most
identifiable
sources
of
MERS
transmission
in
South
Korea
,
similar
to
other
countries
,
in-depth
epidemiological
investigation
was
required
for
some
confirmed
cases
with
indefinite
contact
history
or
hospital
visit
records
.

The
subject
of
epidemiological
investigation
in
the
present
study
was
a
35
year-old
male
patient
diagnosed
with
MERS
(
#
119
)
who
lived
in
Asan-city
and
worked
in
Pyeongtaek-city
.

Various
potential
sources
of
transmission
were
carefully
investigated
.

While
he
could
have
been
exposed
to
MERS
through
a
friend
from
Saudi
Arabia
or
confirmed
MERS
cases
in
his
workplace
,
neighboring
areas
,
and
medical
institutions
,
as
well
as
contacts
in
his
home
,
the
chances
of
transmission
were
low
;
however
,
the
potential
for
transmission
through
his
local
community
could
not
be
excluded
.

Practically
,
it
was
difficult
to
determine
the
modes
of
transmission
for
all
outbreak
cases
in
communicable
disease
that
occurred
in
this
short
period
of
time
.

The
investigation
to
identify
the
mode
of
transmission
in
this
case
was
ultimately
unsuccessful
.

However
,
the
various
data
collected
and
analyzed
to
reveal
modes
of
transmission
provided
detailed
information
that
could
not
be
collected
using
only
interview
surveys
.

Objective
:
This
paper
describes
the
physical
structure
and
environmental
contamination
in
selected
hospital
wards
in
three
government
hospitals
in
Bangladesh
.

The
qualitative
research
team
conducted
48
hours
of
observation
in
six
wards
from
three
Bangladeshi
tertiary
hospitals
in
2007
.

They
recorded
environmental
contamination
with
body
secretions
and
excretions
and
medical
waste
and
observed
ward
occupant
handwashing
and
use
of
personal
protective
equipment
.

They
recorded
number
of
persons
,
number
of
open
doors
and
windows
,
and
use
of
fans
.

They
measured
the
ward
area
and
informally
observed
waste
disposal
outside
the
wards
.

They
conducted
nine
focus
group
discussions
with
doctors
,
nurses
and
support
staff
.

Results
:
A
median
of
3.7
persons
were
present
per
10
m
2
of
floor
space
in
the
wards
.

A
median
of
4.9
uncovered
coughs
or
sneezes
were
recorded
per
10
m
2
per
hour
per
ward
.

Floors
in
the
wards
were
soiled
with
saliva
,
spit
,
mucous
,
vomitus
,
feces
and
blood
125
times
in
48
hours
.

Only
two
of
the
12
patient
handwashing
stations
had
running
water
and
none
had
soap
.

No
disinfection
was
observed
before
or
after
using
medical
instruments
.

Used
medical
supplies
were
often
discarded
in
open
containers
under
the
beds
.

Handwashing
with
soap
was
observed
in
only
32
of
3,373
handwashing
opportunities
noted
during
48
hours
.

Mosquitoes
and
feral
cats
were
commonly
observed
in
the
wards
.

The
physical
structure
and
environment
of
our
study
hospitals
are
conducive
to
the
spread
of
infection
to
people
in
the
wards
.

Low-cost
interventions
on
hand
hygiene
and
cleaning
procedures
for
rooms
and
medical
equipment
should
be
developed
and
evaluated
for
their
practicality
and
effectiveness

suggesting
that
the
ciliated

.

At

the
avian

among
chicken

illustrates
a
primary
cell
model
for
evaluating
the

Models
of
infectious
disease
spread
that
incorporate
contact
heterogeneity
through
contact
networks
are
an
important
tool
for
epidemiologists
studying
disease
dynamics
and
assessing
intervention
strategies
.

One
of
the
challenges
of
contact
network
epidemiology
has
been
the
difficulty
of
collecting
individual
and
population-level
data
needed
to
develop
an
accurate
representation
of
the
underlying
host
population
's
contact
structure
.

In
this
study
,
we
evaluate
the
utility
of
common
epidemiological
measures
(
R
0
,
epidemic
peak
size
,
duration
and
final
size
)
for
inferring
the
degree
of
heterogeneity
in
a
population
's
unobserved
contact
structure
through
a
Bayesian
approach
.

We
test
the
method
using
ground
truth
data
and
find
that
some
of
these
epidemiological
metrics
are
effective
at
classifying
contact
heterogeneity
.

The
classification
is
also
consistent
across
pathogen
transmission
probabilities
,
and
so
can
be
applied
even
when
this
characteristic
is
unknown
.

In
particular
,
the
reproductive
number
,
R
0
,
turns
out
to
be
a
poor
classifier
of
the
degree
heterogeneity
,
while
,
unexpectedly
,
final
epidemic
size
is
a
powerful
predictor
of
network
structure
across
the
range
of
heterogeneity
.

We
also
evaluate
our
framework
on
empirical
epidemiological
data
from
past
and
recent
outbreaks
to
demonstrate
its
application
in
practice
and
to
gather
insights
about
the
relevance
of
particular
contact
structures
for
both
specific
systems
and
general
classes
of
infectious
disease
.

We
thus
introduce
a
simple
approach
that
can
shed
light
on
the
unobserved
connectivity
of
a
host
population
given
epidemic
data
.

Our
study
has
the
potential
to
inform
future
data-collection
efforts
and
study
design
by
driving
our
understanding
of
germane
epidemic
measures
,
and
highlights
a
general
inferential
approach
to
learning
about
host
contact
structure
in
contemporary
or
historic
populations
of
humans
and
animals

The
RNA
interference
(
RNAi
)
pathway
is
a
potent
antiviral
defense
mechanism
in
plants
and
invertebrates
,
in
response
to
which
viruses
evolved
suppressors
of
RNAi
.

In
mammals
,
the
first
line
of
defense
is
mediated
by
the
type
I
interferon
system
(
IFN
)
;
however
,
the
degree
to
which
RNAi
contributes
to
antiviral
defense
is
still
not
completely
understood
.

Recent
work
suggests
that
antiviral
RNAi
is
active
in
undifferentiated
stem
cells
and
that
antiviral
RNAi
can
be
uncovered
in
differentiated
cells
in
which
the
IFN
system
is
inactive
or
in
infections
with
viruses
lacking
putative
viral
suppressors
of
RNAi
.

In
this
review
,
we
describe
the
mechanism
of
RNAi
and
its
antiviral
functions
in
insects
and
mammals
.

We
draw
parallels
and
highlight
differences
between
(
antiviral
)
RNAi
in
these
classes
of
animals
and

open
questions

future
research

The

in
the
3

UTRs
of
198
mRNAs

.

Target
recognition
is
initiated
by
a
short
nucleotide
stretch
at
the
5
'
end
of
the
miRNA

the
so-called

Mechanisms
for
miRNA-mediated
gene

de-adenylation
,
and
enhancement

mRNA
decay
[

The
majority
of
mRNAs
is
estimated
202
to
be
regulated
by
miRNAs
[
100
]
,
and
post-transcriptional
regulation
by
miRNAs
is
thus
implicated
203
in
almost
all
cell
biological
processes
.

Although
miRNA-mediated
gene
regulation
seems
to
be
the
dominant
function
of
mammalian
205
RNAi
,
early
evidence
has
already
indicated
that
the
siRNA
pathway
is
functional
in
mammals
.

Transfection
of
synthetic
siRNAs
or
expression
of
short-hairpin
RNAs
(
shRNAs
)
with
207
complementarity
to
a
gene
of
interest
was
found
to
induce
robust
and
sequence-specific
RNAi
,
208
without
activation
of
the
interferon
response
as
siRNAs
are
too
short
to
be
detected
by
dsRNA
209
sensors
(
discussed
in
Section
3.1
)
[
25
,

]
.

Moreover
,
long
dsRNA
was
reported
to
be
functional
in

We
report
the
first
complete
genome
sequence
of
a
feline
astrovirus
(
FAstV
)
,
FAstV2
strain
1637F
,
identified
from
a
domestic
cat
.

The
genome
is
6,779
nucleotides
(
nt
)
in
length
and
consists
of
three
overlapping
open
reading
frames
(
ORF1a-ORF1b-ORF2
)
.

Sequence
analysis
suggests
that
FAstV2
represents
a
new
FAstV
genotype
that
is
closely
related
to
human
astroviruses

The
dynamics
of
infectious
diseases
spread
via
direct
person-to-person
transmission
(
such
as
influenza
,
smallpox
,
HIV/AIDS
,
etc
.
)

depends
on
the
underlying
host
contact
network
.

Human
contact
networks
exhibit
strong
community
structure
.

Understanding
how
such
community
structure
affects
epidemics
may
provide
insights
for
preventing
the
spread
of
disease
between
communities
by
changing
the
structure
of
the
contact
network
through
pharmaceutical
or
non-pharmaceutical
interventions
.

We
use
empirical
and
simulated
networks
to
investigate
the
spread
of
disease
in
networks
with
community
structure
.

We
find
that
community
structure
has
a
major
impact
on
disease
dynamics
,
and
we
show
that
in
networks
with
strong
community
structure
,
immunization
interventions
targeted
at
individuals
bridging
communities
are
more
effective
than
those
simply
targeting
highly
connected
individuals
.

Because
the
structure
of
relevant
contact
networks
is
generally
not
known
,
and
vaccine
supply
is
often
limited
,
there
is
great
need
for
efficient
vaccination
algorithms
that
do
not
require
full
knowledge
of
the
network
.

We
developed
an
algorithm
that
acts
only
on
locally
available
network
information
and
is
able
to
quickly
identify
targets
for
successful
immunization
intervention
.

The
algorithm
generally
outperforms
existing
algorithms
when
vaccine
supply
is
limited
,
particularly
in
networks
with
strong
community
structure
.

Understanding
the
spread
of
infectious
diseases
and
designing
optimal
control
strategies
is
a
major
goal
of
public
health
.

Social
networks
show
marked
patterns
of
community
structure
,
and
our
results
,
based
on
empirical
and
simulated
data
,
demonstrate
that
community
structure
strongly
affects
disease
dynamics
.

These
results
have
implications
for
the
design
of
control
strategies

Sputum
examination
can
be
useful
in
diagnosing
the
cause
of
pneumonia
in
adults
but
is
less
well
established
in
children
.

We
sought
to
assess
the
diagnostic
utility
of
polymerase

for
detection
of
respiratory

Among

we
compared
organism

by
multiplex
PCR
in

To
assess
whether

in
IS
specimens
was
associated
with
chest

,
we
compared
prevalence

Results

Among
4232
cases
with
World
Health
Organization-defined
severe

,
we
identified

with
radiographic
pneumonia
and
573
(
13.5
%

with
nonpneumonia
.

The
organism
detection
yield
was
marginally
improved
with
IS
specimens

.

After
accounting
for
presence

no

there
were
no
statistically
significant
differences

Conclusions

Using

Korea
failed
in
its
risk
communication
during
the
early
stage
of
the
Middle

(
MERS
)
outbreak
;
consequently
,
it
faced
difficulties
in
managing
MERS
,
while
disease-related
worry
increased
.

Disease-related
worry
can
help
disease
prevention
and
management
,
but
can
also
have
a
detrimental
effect
.

This
study
measured
the
overall
level
of
disease-related
worry
during
the
MERS
outbreak
period
in
Korea
and
the
influencing
factors
and
levels
of
disease-related
worry
during
key
outbreak
periods
.

The
cross-sectional
survey
included
1,000
adults
who
resided
in
Korea
.

An
ordinal
logistic
regression
was
performed
for
the
overall
level
of
MERS-related
worry
,
and
influencing
factors
of
worry
were
analyzed
.

A
reliability
test
was
performed
on
the
levels
of
MERS-related
worry
during
key
outbreak
periods
.

The
overall
level
of
MERS-related
worry
was
2.44
.

Multivariate
analysis
revealed
that
women
and
respondents
w
very
poor
subjective
health
status
had
higher
levels
of
worry
.

Respondents
with
very
high
stress
in
daily
life
had
higher
levels
of
worry
than
those
who
reported
having
little
stress
.

The
reliability
test
results
on
MERS-related
worry
scores
during
key
outbreak
periods
showed
consistent
scores
during
each
period
.

Level
of
worry
increased
in
cases
having
higher
perceived
susceptibility
and
greater
trust
in
informal
information
,
while
initial
stage
of
outbreak
was
closely
associated
with
that
at
later
stages
.

These
findings
suggest
the
importance
of
managing
the
level
of
worry
by
providing
timely
and
accurate
disease-related
information
during
the
initial
stage
of
disease
outbreak

Background

in
young

Assessing
the

of
infection

Ubiquitin-specific
protease
2
(
USP2
)
belongs
to
the
family
of
deubiquitinases
that
can
rescue
protein
targets
from
proteasomal
degradation
by
reversing
their
ubiquitination
.

In
various
cancers
,
including
prostate
cancer
and
ovarian
carcinoma
,
upregulation
of
USP2
leads
to
an
increase
in
the
levels
of
deubiquitinated
substrates
such
as
fatty
acid
synthase
,
MDM2
,
cyclin
D1
and
Aurora-A
.

USP2
thus
plays
a
critical
role
in
tumor
cells
'
survival
and
therefore
represents
a
therapeutic
target
.

Here
a
leukemia
drug
,
6-thioguanine
,
was
found
to
be
a
potent
inhibitor
of
USP2
.

Enzyme-kinetic
and
X-ray
crystallographic
data
suggest
that
6-thioguanine
displays
a
noncompetitive
and
slow-binding
inhibitory
mechanism
against
USP2
.

Our
study
provides
a
clear
rationale
for
the
clinical
evaluation
of
6-thioguanine
for
USP2-upregulated
cancers
.

Ubiquitination
,
a
kind
of
post-translational
modification
,
as
well
as
deubiquitination
,
which
together
comprise
the
ubiquitination
system
,
can
regulate
not
only
the
turnover
of
cellular
proteins
but
also
,
through
various
modes
of
mono-or
polyubiquitination
,
receptor
trafficking
,
DNA
repair
,
cell-cycle
progression
,
immune
response
,
autophagy
and
apoptosis
1
.

This
versatility
has
raised
interest
in
pinpointing
components
of
the
ubiquitin
system
as
prime
candidates
for
drug
targets
2
.

Among
them
,
the
pursuit
of
deubiquitinases
(
DUBs
)
as
pharmaceutical
targets
is
still
in
its
infancy
in
that
few
inhibitors
have
entered
clinical
trials
,
albeit
some
broad-spectrum
inhibitors
have
been
patented
and
highly
selective
inhibitors
have
been
developed
3-6
.

The
human
genome
encodes
about
80-90
DUBs
,
of
which
the
largest
of
the
five
DUB
families
is
the
ubiquitin-specific
proteases
(
USPs
)
7
.

One
of
these
,
USP2
,
is
able
to
remove
ubiquitin
from
a
range
of
protein
substrates
such
as
fatty
acid
synthase
8
,
MDM2
9
,
cyclin
D1
10
and
Aurora-A
11
.

Fatty
acid
synthase
has
been
reported
to
be
highly
expressed
in
a
variety
of
cancers
,
including
cancers
of
the
prostate
,
ovary
,
lung
,
colon
,
and
breast
12
,
while
MDM2
,
cyclin
D1
and
Aurora-A
play
critical
roles
in
p53
regulation
,
cell
cycle
progression
and
mitotic
events
,
respectively
9,10,13
.

All
of
these
studies
suggest
that
the
inhibition
of
USP2
may
be
a
good

In
2016
,
Davis
et

.

reported
that
a
small
molecule
,
ML364
,
can
induce
cell
cycle
arrest
and
inhibit
the
growth
of
colorectal
and
mantle
cell
lymphoma
cell
lines
via
USP2
inhibition
,
albeit
it
is
still
not
a
clinical
drug
.

In
the
present
study
,
6-thioguanine
(
6TG
)
,
an
old
drug
still
clinically
used
to
treat
leukemia
,
rheumatoid
arthritis
and
bowel
disease

,
was
identified
as
a
potent
USP2
inhibitor
.

Further
studies
using
enzyme
kinetics
and
X-ray
crystallography
to
delineate
its
direct
binding
to
USP2
were
performed
.

Our
findings
support
earlier
results
suggesting
that
6TG
has
a
broad
spectrum
of
activity
[
15
]
[
16
]
[
17
]
,
and
have
implications
with
respect
to
the
need
for
direct
clinical
evaluation
of
its
use
against
USP2-upregulated
cancers
.

Identification
of

According
to
previous
studies
involving
molecular
docking
experiments
,
the
anti-leukemia
and
immunosuppressant
drugs
6MP

,
which
act
as
inhibitors
of
SARS

)
,
may
also
be
able
to
bind
to
the
active
site
of
human
USP2
as
both
kinds

Background
:
Lower
respiratory
tract
infections
(
LRTI
)
are
responsible
for
a
considerable
number
of
deaths
among
children
,
particularly
in
developing
countries
.

In
Egypt
and
the
Middle
East
region
,
there
is
a
lack
of
data
regarding
the
viral
causes
of
LRTI
.

In
this
study
,
we
aimed
to
identify
the
relative
prevalence
of
various
respiratory
viruses
that
contribute
to
LRTIs
in
young
children
.

Although
,
nucleic
acid-based
methods
have
gained
importance
as
a
sensitive
tool
to
determine
the
viral
infections
,
their
use
is
limited
because
of
their
prohibitive
cost
in
low-income
countries
.

Therefore
,
we
applied
three
different
laboratory
methods
,
and
presented
the
different
virus
prevalence
patterns
detected
by
each
method
.

Methods
:
We
collected
nasopharyngeal
aspirate
samples
,
demographic
data
and
,
clinical
data
from
450
children
under
five
years
of
age
who
presented
with
LRTI
at
Abou
El
Reesh
hospital
in
Cairo
during
a
one-year
period
.

To
identify
the
viral
causes
of
the
LRTI
we
used
direct
fluorescence
assay
,
real-time
reverse-transcriptase
polymerase
chain
reaction
(
rt-RT-PCR
)
,
and
shell
vial
culture
.

We
tested
for
eight
major
respiratory
viruses
.

Results
:
Two
hundred
sixty-nine
patients
(
59.9
%
)
had
a
viral
infection
,
among
which
10.8
%
had
a
co-infection
with
two
or
more
viruses
.

By
all
three
methods
,
respiratory
syncytial
virus
(
RSV
)
was
the
most
predominant
,
and
parainfluenza
virus
type
2
(
HPIV-2
)
,
influenza
B
virus
(
FLUBV
)
were
the
least
predominant
.

Other
viral
prevalence
patterns
differed
according
to
the
detection
method
used
.

The
distribution
of
various
viruses
among
different
age
groups
and
seasonal
distribution
of
the
viruses
were
also
determined
.

Conclusions
:
RSV
and
human
adenovirus
were
the
most
common
respiratory
viruses
detected
by
rt-RT-PCR
.

Co-infections
were
found
to
be
frequent
among
children
and
the
vast
majority
of
co-infections
were
detected
by
nucleic
acid-based
detection
assays
.

Andes
virus
(
ANDV
)
is
associated
with
a
lethal
vascular
leak
syndrome
in
humans
termed
hantavirus
pulmonary
syndrome
(
HPS
)
.

The
mechanism
for
the
massive
vascular
leakage
associated
with
HPS
is
poorly
understood
;
however
,
dysregulation
of
components
of
the
immune
response
is
often
suggested
as
a
possible
cause
.

Alveolar
macrophages
are
found
in
the
alveoli
of
the
lung
and
represent
the
first
line
of
defense
to
many
airborne
pathogens
.

To
determine
whether
alveolar
macrophages
play
a
role
in
HPS
pathogenesis
,
alveolar
macrophages
were
depleted
in
an
adult
rodent
model
of
HPS
that
closely
resembles
human
HPS
.

Syrian
hamsters
were
treated
,
intratracheally
,
with
clodronate-encapsulated
liposomes
or
control
liposomes
and
were
then
challenged
with
ANDV
.

Treatment
with
clodronate-encapsulated
liposomes
resulted
in
significant
reduction
in
alveolar
macrophages
,
but
depletion
did
not
prevent
pathogenesis
or
prolong
disease
.

Depletion
also
did
not
significantly
reduce
the
amount
of
virus
in
the
lung
of
ANDV-infected
hamsters
but
altered
neutrophil
recruitment
,
MIP-1␣
and
MIP-2
chemokine
expression
,
and
vascular
endothelial
growth
factor
(
VEGF
)
levels
in
hamster
bronchoalveolar
lavage
(
BAL
)
fluid
early
after
intranasal
challenge
.

These
data
demonstrate
that
alveolar
macrophages
may
play
a
limited
protective
role
early
after
exposure
to
aerosolized
ANDV
but
do
not
directly
contribute
to
hantavirus
disease
pathogenesis
in
the
hamster
model
of
HPS
.

Hantaviruses
continue
to
cause
disease
worldwide
for
which
there
are
no
FDA-licensed
vaccines
,
effective
postexposure
prophylactics
,
or
therapeutics
.

Much
of
this
can
be
attributed
to
a
poor
understanding
of
the
mechanism
of
hantavirus
disease
pathogenesis
.

Hantavirus
disease
has
long
been
considered
an
immune-mediated
disease
;
however
,
by
directly
manipulating
the
Syrian
hamster
model
,
we
continue
to
eliminate
individual
immune
cell
types
.

As
the
most
numerous
immune
cells
present
in
the
respiratory
tract
,
alveolar
macrophages
are
poised
to
defend
against
hantavirus
infection
,
but
those
antiviral
responses
may
also
contribute
to
hantavirus
disease
.

Here
,
we
demonstrate
that
,
like
in
our
prior
T
and
B
cell
studies
,
alveolar
macrophages
neither
prevent
hantavirus
infection
nor
cause
hantavirus
disease
.

While
these
studies
reflect
pathogenesis
in
the
hamster
model
,
they
should
help
us
rule
out
specific
cell
types
and
prompt
us
to
consider
other
potential
mechanisms
of
disease
in
an
effort
to
improve
the
outcome
of
human
HPS
.

Background
:
Pneumonia
remains
a
leading
cause
of
child
death
in
developing
countries
.

The
viruses
in
severe
pneumonia
remain
poorly
defined
.

.

Patients
aged
8
days
to
13
years
old
who
were
admitted
to
the
Department
of
Pediatrics
with
severe
pneumonia
were
enrolled
for
the
study
.

Upon
admission
,
polymerase
chain
reaction
was
performed
using
nasopharyngeal
swabs
and
blood
cultures
to
detect
respiratory
viruses
and
bacteria
,
respectively
.

Result
:
Among
the
819
patients
enrolled
,
at
least
one
virus
was
detected
in
501
cases
(
61.2
%
)
.

In
addition
,
423
cases
were
positive
for
a
single
virus
while
bacteria
were
detected
in
the
blood
culture
sample
of
31
cases
.

The
most
commonly
detected
viruses
were
human
rhinoviruses
(
n
=
189
)
,
including
types
A
(
n
=
103
)
,
B
(
n
=
17
)
,
and
C
(

69
)
,
and
respiratory
syncytial

(
RSV
)
(
n
=

)
.

Novel
viruses
such
as
human
metapneumovirus
,
human
coronavirus
NL63
,
human
bocavirus
,
and
human
polyomaviruses
WU
and
KI
were
also
detected
.

There
were
70
deaths
,
and
one
or
more
viruses
were
detected
in
35
(
50

)
of
these
cases
.

was
significantly
associated
with

.

From
the

,
and
Salmonella

were
also
isolated
.

Conclusion
:
Viruses
were
commonly
detected
in
children
with
severe
pneumonia
in
the
Philippines
.

Hence
,
viral
etiologies
should
be
considered
while
developing
better
effective
strategies
to
reduce
child
pneumonia-related
deaths
in
developing
countries
.

Tollip
plays
an
important
role
in
the
interleukin-1
receptor
IL-1R
and
Toll
pathways
.

As
a
modulator
of
the
immune
pathway
,
it
indirectly
controls
the
amount
of
antimicrobial
peptides
.

This
could
indicate
a
vital
step
in
maintaining
animal
immune
systems
and
preventing
infection
.

Evolutionary
questions
are
crucial
to
understanding
the
conservation
and
functioning
of
the
biochemical
pathways
like
the
Tollip-mediated
one
.

Through
an
analysis
of
36
sequences
of
the
Tollip
protein
from
different
animal
taxa
,
downloaded
from
Kyoto
Encyclopedia
of
Genes
and
Genomes
(
KEGG
)
databank
,
we
inferred
diverse
evolutionary
parameters
,
such
as
molecular
selection
and
structure
conservation
,
by
analyzing
residue
by
residue
,
beyond
the
canonical
parameters
to
this
type
of
study
,
as
maximum
likelihood
trees
.

We
found
that
Tollip
presented
different
trends
in
its
evolving
history
.

In
primates
,
the
protein
is
becoming
more
unstable
,
just
the
opposite
is
observed
in
the
arthropod
group
.

The
most
interesting
finding
was
the
concentration
of
positively
selected
residues
at
amino
terminal
ends
.

Some
observed
topological
incongruences
in
maximum
likelihood
trees
of
complete
and
curated
Tollip
data
sets
could
be
explained
through
horizontal
transfers
,
evidenced
by
recombination
detection
.

These
results
suggest
that
there
is
more
to
be
researched
and
understood
about
this
protein
.

Exacerbations
of
chronic
obstructive
pulmonary
disease
(
COPD
)
are
important
events
that
carry
significant
consequences
for
patients
.

Some
patients
experience
frequent
exacerbations
,
and
are
now
recognized
as
a
distinct
clinical
subgroup
,
the
'frequent
exacerbator
'
phenotype
.

This
is
relatively
stable
over
time
,
occurs
across
disease
severity
,
and
is
associated
with
poorer
health
outcomes
.

These
patients
are
therefore
a
priority
for
research
and
treatment
.

The
pathophysiology
underlying
the
frequent
exacerbator
phenotype
is
complex
,
with
increased
airway
and
systemic
inflammation
,
dynamic
lung
hyperinflation
,
changes
in
lower
airway
bacterial
colonization
and
a
possible
increased
susceptibility
to
viral
infection
.

Frequent
exacerbators
are
also
at
increased
risk
from
comorbid
extrapulmonary
diseases
including
cardiovascular
disease
,
gastroesophageal
reflux
,
depression
,
osteoporosis
and
cognitive
impairment
.

Overall
these
patients
have
poorer
health
status
,
accelerated
forced
expiratory
volume
over
1
s
(
FEV1
)
decline
,
worsened
quality
of
life
,
and
increased
hospital
admissions
and
mortality
,
contributing
to
increased
exacerbation
susceptibility
and
perpetuation
of
the
frequent
exacerbator
phenotype
.

This
review
article
sets
out
the
definition
and
importance
of
the
frequent
exacerbator
phenotype
,
with
a
detailed
examination
of
its
pathophysiology
,
impact
and
interaction
with
other
comorbidities
.

Background
:
Absenteeism
due
to
communicable
illness
is
a
major
problem
encountered
by
North
American
elementary
school
children
.

Although
handwashing
is
a
proven
infection
control
measure
,
barriers
exist
in
the
school
environment
,
which
hinder
compliance
to
this
routine
.

Currently
,
alternative
hand
hygiene
techniques
are
being
considered
,
and
one
such
technique
is
the
use
of
antimicrobial
rinse-free
hand
sanitizers
.

A
systematic
review
was
conducted
to
examine
the
effectiveness
of
antimicrobial
rinsefree
hand
sanitizer
interventions
in
the
elementary
school

.

Absenteeism

:
Six
eligible

.

The
quality
of
reporting
was
low
.

Due
to
a
large
amount
of
heterogeneity
and
low
quality
of
reporting
,
no
pooled
estimates
were
calculated
.

There
was
a
significant
difference
reported
in
favor
of
the
intervention
in
all
5
published

.

The
available
evidence
for
the
effectiveness
of
antimicrobial
rinse-free
hand
sanitizer
in
the
school
environment
is
of
low
quality
.

The
results
suggest
that
the
strength
of
the
benefit
should
be
interpreted
with
caution

Photonic

have
attracted
great
attention
due
to
high-quality
factors

small-mode

)
and
good
on-chip
integrability

In
this
review
,
we
will
focus
on
nanoscale
optical
sensing
based
on
1D-PCNCs
.

The
structure
of
the
review
is
organized
as
follows
.

A
comprehensive
overview
about
basic
properties
and
sensing
mechanisms
of
1D-PCNCs
sensors
is
discussed
in
Section
2
.

In
Section
3
,
firstly
,
we
introduce
the
efforts
to
pursue
ultra-high
figure
of
merit
(
FOM
)
in
refractive
index
(
RI
)
sensing
based
on
1D-PCNCs
.

Secondly
,
we
outline
the
applications
of
1D-PCNC
sensors
on
single
nanoparticle
and
label-free
molecule
(
viruses
,
proteins
and
DNAs
)
detection
.

Thirdly
,
a
monolithic
integrated
1D-PCNC
sensor
array
for
multiplexed
sensing
is
introduced
explicitly
.

In
addition
,
we
present
other
sensing
applications
of
1D-PCNC
sensors
such
as
temperature
sensing
and
optomechanical
sensing
,
etc
.

Next
,
we
review
the
nanofabrication
and
coupling
techniques
in
the
development
of
1D-PCNC
sensors
in
Section
4
.

Finally
,
we
draw
a
brief
conclusion
.

Using
parametric
and
nonparametric
methods
,
we
estimated
a
mean
incubation
period
of
6.9
days
(
95
%
credibility
interval
:
6.3-7.5
)
for
cases

among
cases
in
Saudi

.

In
a
log-linear
regression
model
,
the
mean
incubation
period
was
1.42
times
longer
(

interval

)
among
cases
in
South
Korea
compared
to
Saudi
Arabia
.

The
variation
that
we
identified
in
the
incubation
period
distribution
between
locations
could
be
associated
with
differences
in
ascertainment
or
reporting
of
exposure
dates
and
illness
onset
dates
,
differences
in
the
source
or
mode
of
infection
,
or
environmental
differences
.

Background
:
Despite
the
development
of
various
systems
to
generate
live
recombinant
Salmonella
Typhimurium
vaccine
strains
,
little
work
has
been
performed
to
systematically
evaluate
and
compare
their
relative
immunogenicity
.

Such
information
would
provide
invaluable
guidance
for
the
future
rational
design
of
live
recombinant
Salmonella
oral
vaccines
.

Interferon-induced
transmembrane
proteins
(
IFITMs
)
can
inhibit
the
cellular
entry
of
several
enveloped
viruses
,
including
simian
immunodeficiency
virus
(
SIV
)
.

The
blockade
of
SIV
by
IFITMs
is
isolate
specific
,
raising
the
question
of
which
parameters
impact
sensitivity
to
IFITM
.

We
show
that
the
virion
context
in
which
SIV-Env
is
presented
and
the
efficiency
of
virion
incorporation
determine
Env
susceptibility
to
inhibition
by
IFITMs
.

Thus
,
determinants
other
than
the
nature
of
the
envelope
protein
can
impact
the
IFITM
sensitivity
of
viral
entry
.

IMPORTANCE
The
host
cell-encoded
IFITM
proteins
can
block
viral
entry
and
are
an
important
component
of
the
innate
defenses
against
viral
infection
.

However
,
the
determinants
controlling
whether
a
virus
is
susceptible
to
blockade
by
IFITM
proteins
are
incompletely
understood
.

Our
study
shows
that
the
amount
of
envelope
proteins
incorporated
into
virions
as
well
as
the
nature
of
the
virion
particle
itself
can
impact
the
sensitivity
of
viral
entry
to
IFITMs
.

These
results
show
for
the
first
time
that
determinants
other
than
the
viral
envelope
protein
can
impact
sensitivity
to
IFITM
and
have
implications
for
the
interpretation
of
previously
published
data
on
inhibition
of
viruses
by
IFITM
proteins
.

Moreover
,
our
findings
might
help
to
define
the
mechanism
underlying
the
antiviral
activity
of
IFITM
proteins

Human
papillomavirus
(
HPV
)
infection
is
the
most
common
viral
infection
of
the
reproductive
tract
,
with
virtually
all
cases
of
cervical
cancer
being
attributable
to
infection
by
oncogenic
HPVs
.

However
,
the
exact
mechanism
and
receptors
used
by
HPV
to
infect
epithelial
cells
are
controversial
.

The
current
entry
model
suggests
that
HPV
initially
attaches
to
heparan
sulfate
proteoglycans
(
HSPGs
)
at
the
cell
surface
,
followed
by
conformational
changes
,
cleavage
by
furin
convertase
,
and
subsequent
transfer
of
the
virus
to
an
as-yet-unidentified
high-affinity
receptor
.

In
line
with
this
model
,
we
established
an
in
vitro
infection
system
using
the
HSPGdeficient
cell
line
pgsD677
together
with
HPV16
pseudovirions
(
HPV16-PsVs
)
.

While
pgsD677
cells
were
nonpermissive
for
untreated
HPV16-PsVs
,
furin
cleavage
of
the
particles
led
to
a
substantial
increase
in
infection
.

Biochemical
pulldown
assays
followed
by
mass
spectrometry
analysis
showed
that
furin-precleaved
HPV16-PsVs
specifically
interacted
with
surface-expressed
vimentin
on
pgsD677
cells
.

We
further
demonstrated
that
both
furin-precleaved
and
uncleaved
HPV16-PsVs
colocalized
with
surface-expressed
vimentin
on
pgsD677
,
HeLa
,
HaCaT
,
and
NIKS
cells
,
while
binding
of
incoming
viral
particles
to
soluble
vimentin
protein
before
infection
led
to
a
substantial
decrease
in
viral
uptake
.

Interestingly
,
decreasing
cell
surface
vimentin
by
small
interfering
RNA
(
siRNA
)
knockdown
in
HeLa
and
NIKS
cells
significantly
increased
HPV16-PsV
infectious
internalization
,
while
overexpression
of
vimentin
had
the
opposite
effect
.

The
identification
of
vimentin
as
an
HPV
restriction
factor
enhances
our
understanding
of
the
initial
steps
of
HPV-host
interaction
and
may
lay
the
basis
for
the
design
of
novel
antiviral
drugs
preventing
HPV
internalization
into
epithelial
cells
.

IMPORTANCE
Despite
HPV
being
a
highly
prevalent
sexually
transmitted
virus
causing
significant
disease
burden
worldwide
,
particularly
cancer
of
the
cervix
,
cell
surface
events
preceding
oncogenic
HPV
internalization
are
poorly
understood
.

We
herein
describe
the
identification
of
surface-expressed
vimentin
as
a
novel
molecule
not
previously
implicated
in
the
infectious
internalization
of
HPV16
.

Contrary
to
our
expectations
,
vimentin
was
found
to
act
not
as
a
receptor
but
rather
as
a
restriction
factor
dampening
the
initial
steps
of
HPV16
infection
.

These
results
importantly
contribute
to
our
current
understanding
of
the
molecular
events
during
the
infectious
internalization
of
HPV16
and
open
a
new
direction
in
the
development
of
alternative
drugs
to
prevent
HPV
infection

Over
the
past
few
decades
,
global
metapopulation
epidemic
simulations
built
with
worldwide
air-transportation
data
have
been
the
main
tool
for
studying
how
epidemics
spread
from
the
origin
to
other
parts
of
the
world
(
e.g.
,
for
pandemic
influenza
,
SARS
,
and
Ebola
)
.

However
,
it
remains
unclear
how
disease
epidemiology
and
the
air-transportation
network
structure
determine
epidemic
arrivals
for
different
populations
around
the
globe
.

Here
,
we
fill
this
knowledge
gap
by
developing
and
validating
an
analytical
framework
that
requires
only
basic
analytics
from
stochastic
processes
.

We
apply
this
framework
retrospectively
to
the
2009
influenza
pandemic
and
2014
Ebola
epidemic
to
show
that
key
epidemic
parameters
could
be
robustly
estimated
in
real-time
from
public
data
on
local
and
global
spread
at
very
low
computational
cost
.

Our
framework
not
only
elucidates
the
dynamics
underlying
global
spread
of
epidemics
but
also
advances
our
capability
in
nowcasting
and
forecasting
epidemics

Human
coronaviruses
(
HCoVs
)
are
known
respiratory
pathogens
associated
with
a
range
of
respiratory
outcomes
.

In
the
past
14
years
,

onset
of

syndrome
coronavirus
(
SARS-CoV

and

coronavirus
(

)
have
thrust
HCoVs
into
spotlight
of
the
research
community
due
to
their
high
pathogenicity
in
humans
.

The
study
of
HCoV-host
interactions
has
contributed
extensively
to
our
understanding
of

pathogenesis
.

In
this
review
,
we
discuss
some
of
the
recent
findings
of
host
cell
factors
that
might
be
exploited
by
HCoVs
to
facilitate
their
own

also
discuss
various
cellular
processes

such
as
apoptosis
,

Glycosylation

a
form

bonded

an

to

dendritic
cell-specific

It
highlights
the
different
effects

infections
and
the
consequences
of
genetic
variation
in

on

.

Complement
contributes
towards
the
initial
defence
against
viral
infections
through
a
sequential
protein
activation
cascade
(
reviewed
in
[

]
)
.

There
are
three
known
complement
activation
pathways
.

Each
pathway
converges
at
the
formation
of
C3
convertase
,
which
activates
downstream
complement
factors
to
constitute
the
membrane
attack
complex
(
MAC
)
.

The
MAC
subsequently
forms
pores
in
the
lipid
membranes
of
pathogens
and
infected
cells
,
causing
osmotic
lysis
.

Parallel
to
the
cascade
,
some
complement
cleavage
products
mediate
inflammation
and
opsonise
pathogens
,
attracting
phagocytes
,
encouraging
antigen
aggregation
and
preventing
viral
entry
.

To
avoid
potentially
damaging
,
excessive
complement
activity
,
stringent
regulation
mechanisms
have
evolved
,
including
complement
factor
cleavage
and
endocytotic
shedding
of
MACs
.

The
alternate
and
classical
complement
pathways
are
triggered
by
foreign
surface
molecules
and
antigen
:
antibody
complexes
,
respectively
.

The
lectin
pathway
involves
the
binding
of
microbial
surface
carbohydrate
moieties
to
serum
lectins
,
which
activates
lectin-bound
MBL-associated
serine
proteases
(
MASPs
)
and
proteins
(
MAPs
)
(

.

Immunological
checkpoints
,
such
as
the
inhibitory
CD200
receptor
(
CD200R
)
,
play
a
dual
role
in
balancing
the
immune
system
during
microbial
infection
.

On
the
one
hand
these
inhibitory
signals
prevent
excessive
immune
mediated
pathology
but
on
the
other
hand
they
may
impair
clearance
of
the
pathogen
.

We
studied
the
influence
of
the
inhibitory
CD200-CD200R
axis
on
clearance
and
pathology
in
two
different
virus
infection
models
.

We
find
that
lack
of
CD200R
signaling
strongly
enhances
type
I
interferon
(
IFN
)
production
and
viral
clearance
and
improves
the
outcome
of
mouse
hepatitis
corona
virus
(
MHV
)
infection
,
particularly
in
female
mice
.

MHV
clearance
is
known
to
be
dependent
on
Toll
like
receptor
7
(
TLR7
)
-mediated
type
I
IFN
production
and
sex
differences
in
TLR7
responses
previously
have
been
reported
for
humans
.

We
therefore
hypothesize
that
CD200R
ligation
suppresses
TLR7
responses
and
that
release
of
this
inhibition
enlarges
sex
differences
in
TLR7
signaling
.

This
hypothesis
is
supported
by
our
findings
that
in
vivo
administration
of
synthetic
TLR7
ligand
leads
to
enhanced
type
I
IFN
production
,
particularly
in
female
Cd200
2/2
mice
and
that
CD200R
ligation
inhibits
TLR7
signaling
in
vitro
.

In
influenza
A
virus
infection
we
show
that
viral
clearance
is
determined
by
sex
but
not
by
CD200R
signaling
.

However
,
absence
of
CD200R
in
influenza
A
virus
infection
results
in
enhanced
lung
neutrophil
influx
and
pathology
in
females
.

Thus
,
CD200-CD200R
and
sex
are
host
factors
that
together
determine
the
outcome
of
viral
infection
.

Our
data
predict
a
sex
bias
in
both
beneficial
and
pathological
immune
responses

Since
we

our
analysis
raises
several
questions
about

the
actual

the
extensive

Background
:
In
Plasmodium
falciparum
malaria
endemic
areas
placental
malaria
(
PM
)
is
an
important
complication
of
malaria
.

The
recurrence
of
malaria
in
primigravidae
women
irrespective
of
acquired
protection
during
childhood
is
caused
by
the
interaction
between
the
parasite-expressed
VAR2CSA
antigen
and
chondroitin
sulfate
A
(
CSA
)
in
the
placental
intervillous
space
and
lack
of
protective
antibodies
.

PM
impairs
fetal
development
mainly
by
excessive
inflammation
processes
.

After
infections
during
pregnancy
women
acquire
immunity
to
PM
conferred
by
antibodies
against
VAR2CSA
.

Ideally
,
a
vaccine
against
PM
will
induce
antibody-mediated
immune
responses
that
block
the
adhesion
of
infected
erythrocytes
(
IE
)
in
the
placenta
.

Principal
Findings
:
We
have
previously
shown
that
antibodies
raised
in
rat
against
individual
domains
of
VAR2CSA
can
block
IE
binding
to
CSA
.

In
this
study
we
have
immunized
mice
,
rats
and
rabbits
with
each
individual
domain
and
the
fulllength
protein
corresponding
to
the
FCR3
VAR2CSA
variant
.

We
found
there
is
an
inherently
higher
immunogenicity
of
Cterminal
domains
compared
to
N-terminally
located
domains
.

This
was
irrespective
of
whether
antibodies
were
induced
against
single
domains
or
the
full-length
protein
.

Species-specific
antibody
responses
were
also
found
,
these
were
mainly
directed
against
single
domains
and
not
the
full-length
VAR2CSA
protein
.

Genetic
material
in
plants
is
distributed
into
nucleus
,
plastids
and
mitochondria
.

Plastid
has
a
central
role
of
carrying
out
photosynthesis
in
plant
cells
.

Plastid
transformation
is
becoming
more
popular
and
an
alternative
to
nuclear
gene
transformation
because
of
various
advantages
like
high
protein
levels
,
the
feasibility
of
expressing
multiple
proteins
from
polycistronic
mRNAs
,
and
gene
containment
through
the
lack
of
pollen
transmission
.

Recently
,
much
progress
in
plastid
engineering
has
been
made
.

In
addition
to
model
plant
tobacco
,
many
transplastomic
crop
plants
have
been
generated
which
possess
higher
resistance
to
biotic
and
abiotic
stresses
and
molecular
pharming
.

In
this
mini
review
,
we
will
discuss
the
features
of
the
plastid
DNA
and
advantages
of
plastid
transformation
.

We
will
also
present
some
examples
of
transplastomic
plants
developed
so
far
through
plastid
engineering
,
and
the
various
applications
of
plastid
transformation
.

Maintenance
of
epigenetic
modifiers
is
of
utmost
importance
to
preserve
the
epigenome
and
consequently
appropriate
cellular
functioning
.

Here
,
we
analyzed
Polycomb
group
protein
(
PcG
)
complex
integrity
in
response
to
heat
shock
(
HS
)
.

Upon
HS
,
various
Polycomb
Repressive
Complex
(
PRC
)
1
and
PRC2
subunits
,
including
CBX
proteins
,
but
also
other
chromatin
regulators
,
are
found
to
accumulate
in
the
nucleolus
.

In
parallel
,
binding
of
PRC1/2
to
target
genes
is
strongly
reduced
,
coinciding
with
a
dramatic
loss
of
H2AK119ub
and
H3K27me3
marks
.

Nucleolar-accumulated
CBX
proteins
are
immobile
,
but
remarkably
both
CBX
protein
accumulation
and
loss
of
PRC1/2
epigenetic
marks
are
reversible
.

This
post-heat
shock
recovery
of
pan-nuclear
CBX
protein
localization
and
reinstallation
of
epigenetic
marks
is
HSP70
dependent
.

Our
findings
demonstrate
that
the
nucleolus
is
an
essential
protein
quality
control
center
,
which
is
indispensable
for
recovery
of
epigenetic
regulators
and
maintenance
of
the
epigenome
after
heat
shock
.

discussion
on
the
topic
of
the
future
of

CSV
and
virus
research
in
Canada
.

Ensuring
the
virological
safety
of
biologicals
is
challenging
due
to
the
risk
of
viral
contamination
of
raw
materials
and
cell
banks
,
and
exposure
during
in-process
handling
to
known
and/or
emerging
viral
pathogens
.

Viruses
may
contaminate
raw
materials
and
biologicals
intended
for
human
or
veterinary
use
and
remain
undetected
until
appropriate
testing
measures
are
employed
.

The
outbreak
and
expansive
spread
of
the
mosquito-borne
flavivirus
Zika
virus
(
ZIKV
)
poses
challenges
to
screening
human-and
animal
-derived
products
used
in
the
manufacture
of
biologicals
.

Here
,
we
report
the
results
of
an
in
vitro
study
where
detector
cell
lines
were
challenged
with
African
and
Asian
lineages
of
ZIKV
.

We
demonstrate
that
this
pathogen
is
robustly
detectable
by
in
vitro
assay
,
thereby
providing
assurance
of
detection
of
ZIKV
,
and
in
turn
underpinning
the
robustness
of
in
vitro
virology
assays
in
safety
testing
of
biologicals
.

Despite
environmental
,
social
and
ecological
dependencies
,
emergence
of
zoonotic
viruses
in
human
populations
is
clearly
also
affected
by
genetic
factors
which
determine
cross-species
transmission
potential
.

RNA
viruses
pose
an
interesting
case
study
given
their
mutation
rates
are
orders
of
magnitude
higher
than
any
other
pathogen
-as
reflected
by
the
recent
emergence
of
SARS
and
Influenza
for
example
.

Here
,
we
show
how
feature
selection
techniques
can
be
used
to
reliably
classify
viral
sequences
by
host
species
,
and
to
identify
the
crucial
minority
of
host-specific
sites
in
pathogen
genomic
data
.

The
variability
in
alleles
at
those
sites
can
be
translated
into
prediction
probabilities
that
a
particular
pathogen
isolate
is
adapted
to
a
given
host
.

We
illustrate
the
power
of
these
methods
by
:

the

.

Interferon-inducible
transmembrane
protein
3
(
IFITM3
)
is
an
effector
protein
of
the
innate
immune
system
.

It
confers
potent
,
cell-intrinsic
resistance
to
infection
by
diverse
enveloped
viruses
both
in
vitro
and
in
vivo
,
including
influenza
viruses
,
West
Nile
virus
,
and
dengue
virus
.

IFITM3
prevents
cytosolic
entry
of
these
viruses
by
blocking
complete
virus
envelope
fusion
with
cell
endosome
membranes
.

Although
the
IFITM
locus
,
which
includes
IFITM1
,
-2
,
-3
,
and
-5
,
is
present
in
mammalian
species
,
this
locus
has
not
been
unambiguously
identified
or
functionally
characterized
in
avian
species
.

Here
,
we
show
that
the
IFITM
locus
exists
in
chickens
and
is
syntenic
with
the
IFITM
locus
in
mammals
.

IFITM2
and
-3
are
constitutively
expressed
in
all
tissues
examined
,
whereas
IFITM1
is
only
expressed
in
the
bursa
of
Fabricius
,
gastrointestinal
tract
,
cecal
tonsil
,
and
trachea
.

Despite
being
highly
divergent
at
the
amino
acid
level
,
IFITM3
proteins
of
birds
and
mammals
can
restrict
replication
of
viruses
that
are
able
to
infect
different
host
species
,
suggesting
IFITM
proteins
may
provide
a
crucial
barrier
for
zoonotic
infections
.

The
chicken
IFITM3
protein
restricts
cell
infection
by
influenza
A
viruses
and
lyssaviruses
to
a
similar
level
as
its
human
orthologue
.

Furthermore
,
we
show
that
chicken
IFITM3
is
functional
in
chicken
cells
and
that
knockdown
of
constitutive
expression
in
chicken
fibroblasts
results
in
enhanced
infection
by
influenza
A
virus
.

Considering
the
high
morbidity
of
hepatitis
B
in
China
,
many
epidemiological
studies
based
on
classic
medical
statistical
analysis
have
been
started
but
lack
spatial
information
.

However
,
spatial
information
such
as
the
spatial
distribution
,
autocorrelation
and
risk
factors
of
the
disease
is
of
great
help
in
studying
patients
with
hepatitis
B
.

This
study
examined
2851
cases
of
hepatitis
B
that
were
hospitalized
in
Shenzhen
in
2010
and
studied
the
spatial
distribution
,
risk
factors
and
spatial
access
to
health
services
using
spatial
interpolation
,
Pearson
correlation
analysis
and
the
improved
two-step
floating
catchment
area
method
.

The
results
showed
that
the
spatial
distribution
of
hepatitis
B
,
along
with
risk
factors
as
well
as
spatial
access
to
the
regional
medical
resources
,
was
uneven
and
mainly
concentrated
in
the
south
and
southwest
of
Shenzhen
in
2010
.

In
addition
,
the
distribution
characteristics
of
hepatitis
B
revealed
a
positive
correlation
between
four
types
of
service
establishments
and
risk
factors
for
the
disease
.

The
Pearson
correlation
coefficients
are
0.566
,
0.515
,
0.626
,
0.538
corresponding
to
bath
centres
,
beauty
OPEN
ACCESS
salons
,
massage
parlours
and
pedicure
parlours
(
p
<
0.05
)
.

Additionally
,
the
allocation
of
medical
resources
for
hepatitis
B
is
adequate
,
as
most
patients
could
be
treated
at
nearby
hospitals
.

The
hepatitis
B
virus
(
HBV
)
is
one
of
the
most
common
viral
infections
in
the
world
,
leading
to
many
deaths
each
year
from
associated
liver
diseases
[

,
2
]
.

HBV
is
also
an
important
public
health
issue
in
China
[
2
]
,
as
national
surveys
conducted
since
the
1970s
have
repeatedly
showed
high
morbidity
from
HBV
infections
in
the
general
population
[
3
,
4
]
.

To
address
this
challenge
,
many
scholars
now
to
study
the
disease
using
different
approaches
(
e.g.
,
pathology
,
immunology
and
epidemiology
)
,
but
none
of
these
approaches
incorporate
spatial
information
[

]
.

With
the
development
of
Geographic
Information
System
(
GIS
)
technology
and
its
applications
in
epidemiology
[
6
]
,
it
has
become
clear
the
spatial
information
has
great
value
in
Epidemiology
.

Spatial
epidemiology
is
a
branch
of
epidemiology
that
uses
spatial
information
to
extend
the
analysis
of
disease
distribution
and
risk
factors
.

This
information
serves
as
a
powerful
analytical
tool
for
epidemiological
studies
and
will
likely
show
greater
significance
in
the
future
[

.

Our
team
have
done
some
works
on
spatial
epidemiology
[

]
.

Using
geographic
information
systems
and
spatial
analysis
technology
,
spatial
epidemiology
attempts
to
describe
and
analyze
human
diseases
,
including
the
spatial
distribution
characteristics
of
health
and
hygiene
events
as
well
as
the
regularity
of
changes
and
developments
.

Spatial
epidemiology
also
explores
the
decisive
elements
that
can
impact
public
health
and
provides
strategies
and
measures
for
disease
prevention
and

and
health
promotion
and
hygiene

Research
on
this

mainly
utilizes
four
elements

Multipartitism
counts
amongst
the
weirdest
lifestyles
found
in
the
virosphere
.

Multipartite
viruses
have
genomes
segmented
in
pieces
enclosed
in
different
capsids
that
are
independently
transmitted
.

Since
all
segments
have
to
meet
in
the
host
for
complementation
and
completion
of
the
viral
cycle
,
multipartite
viruses
are
bound
to
fight
the
loss
of
genomic
information
.

While
this
is
an
obvious
disadvantage
of
this
strategy
,
no
consensus
on
its
actual
advantages
has
been
reached
.

In
this
review
we
present
an
exhaustive
summary
of
all
multipartite
viruses
described
to
date
.

Based
on
evidence
,
we
discuss
possible
mechanistic
and
evolutionary
origins
of
different
groups
,
as
well
as
their
mutual
relationships
.

We
argue
that
the
ubiquitous
interactions
of
viruses
with
other
unrelated
viruses
and
with
subviral
elements
might
be
regarded
as
a
plausible
first
step
towards
multipartitism
.

In
agreement
with
the
view
of
the
Virosphere
as
a
deeply
entangled
network
of
gene
sharing
,
we
contend
that
the
power
of
multipartitism
relies
on
its
dynamical
and
opportunistic
nature
,
because
it
enables
immediate
adaptive
responses
to
environmental
changes
.

As
such
,
perhaps
the
reasons
for
its
success
should
be
shought
in
multipartitism
itself
as
an
adaptive
mechanism
,
to
which
its
evolutionarily
short-lived
products
(
that
is
,
the
extant
ensemble
of
multipartite
viral
species
)
are
subordinated
.

We
close
by
discussing
how
our
understanding
of
multipartitism
would
improve
by
using
concepts
and
tools
from
systems

)
is
a
significant
concern
for
public
health
policy
makers
.

World
Health

'
(
AGPs
)
are
thought
to
increase
the
risk
of
aerosol

to
HCWs
,
but
there
are
presently
insufficient
data
to
quantify
risk
accurately
or
establish
a

.

Methodology/Principal
Findings
:
This
study
measured
the
amount
of
H1N1
(
2009
)
RNA
in
aerosols
in
the
vicinity
of
H1N1

patients
undergoing
AGPs
to
help
quantify
the
potential
risk
of
transmission
to

Conclusions/Significance
:
With
our
small
sample
size
we
found
that
AGPs
do
not
significantly
increase
the
probability
of

Further
,
larger
studies
are
required
but
these
preliminary
findings
may
be
of
benefit
to
infection

teams
.

Background
:
The
spike
proteins
of
coronaviruses
associate
with
cellular
molecules
to
mediate
infection
of
their
target
cells
.

The
characterization
of
cellular
proteins
required
for
virus
infection
is
essential
for
understanding
viral
life
cycles
and
may
provide
cellular
targets
for
antiviral
therapies
.

Results
:
We
identified
Neural
Cell
Adhesion
Molecule
(
NCAM
)
as
a
novel
interacting
partner
of
the
PHE-CoV
S
protein
.

A
T7
phage
display
cDNA
library
from
N2a
cells
was
constructed
,
and
the
library
was
screened
with
the
soluble
PHE-CoV
S
glycoproteins
.

We
used
a
coimmunoprecipitation
assay
to
show
that
only
the
NCAM
was
a
binding
partner
of
spike
protein
.

We
found
that
a
soluble
form
of
anti-NCAM
antibody
blocked
association
of
the
PHE-CoV
with
N2a
cells
.

Furthermore
,
double-stranded
siRNA
targeted
against
NCAM
inhibited
PHE-CoV
infection
.

Conclusions
:
A
novel
interaction
was
identified
between
NCAM
and
spike
protein
and
this
association
is
critical
during
PHE-CoV
infection

Asthma
is
a
chronic
respiratory
disease
characterized
by
reversible
airway
obstruction
and
airway
hyperresponsiveness
to
non-specific
bronchoconstriction
agonists
as
the
primary
underlying
pathophysiology
.

The
worldwide
incidence
of
asthma
has
increased
dramatically
in
the
last
40
years
.

According
to
World
Health
Organization
(
WHO
)
estimates
,
over
300
million
children
and
adults
worldwide
currently
suffer
from
this
incurable
disease
and
255,000
die
from
the
disease
each
year
.

It
is
now
well
accepted
that
asthma
is
a
heterogeneous
syndrome
and
many
clinical
subtypes
have
been
described
.

Viral
infections
such
as
respiratory
syncytial
virus
(
RSV
)
and
human
rhinovirus
(
hRV
)
have
been
implicated
in
asthma
exacerbation
in
children
because
of
their
ability
to
cause
severe
airway
inflammation
and
wheezing
.

Infections
with
atypical
bacteria
also
appear
to
play
a
role
in
the
induction
and
exacerbation
of
asthma
in
both
children
and
adults
.

Recent
studies
confirm
the
existence
of
an
infectious
asthma
etiology
mediated
by
Chlamydia
pneumoniae
(
CP
)
and
possibly
by
other
viral
,
bacterial
and
fungal
microbes
.

It
is
also
likely
that
early-life
infections
with
microbes
such
as
CP
could
lead
to
alterations
in
the
lung
microbiome
that
significantly
affect
asthma
risk
and
treatment
outcomes
.

These
infectious
microbes
may
exacerbate
the
symptoms
of
established
chronic
asthma
and
may
even
contribute
to
the
initial
development
of
the
clinical
onset
of
the
disease
.

It
is
now
becoming
more
widely
accepted
that
patterns
of
airway
inflammation
differ
based
on
the
trigger
responsible
for
asthma
initiation
and
exacerbation
.

Therefore
,
a
better
understanding
of
asthma
subtypes
is
now
being
explored
more
aggressively
,
not
only
to
decipher
pathophysiologic
mechanisms
but
also
to
select
treatment
and
guide
prognoses
.

This
review
will
explore
infection-mediated
asthma
with
special
emphasis
on
the
protean
manifestations
of
CP
lung
infection
,
clinical
characteristics
of
infection-mediated
asthma
,
mechanisms
involved
and
antibiotic
treatment
outcomes
.

Regulation
of
proteolysis
plays
a
critical
role
in
a
myriad
of
important
cellular
processes
.

The
key
to
better
understanding
the
mechanisms
that
control
this
process
is
to
identify
the
specific
substrates
that
each
protease
targets
.

To
address
this
,
we
have
developed
iProt-Sub
,
a
powerful
bioinformatics
tool
for
the
accurate
prediction
of
protease-specific
substrates
and
their
cleavage
sites
.

Importantly
,
iProt-Sub
represents
a
significantly
advanced
version
of
its
successful
predecessor
,
PROSPER
.

It
provides
optimized
cleavage
site
prediction
models
with
better
prediction
performance
and
coverage
for
more
species-specific
proteases
(

major
protease
families
and

different
proteases
)

.

Features
used
by
iProt-Sub
are
encoded
by

different
sequence

schemes
,
including
local

which
will
allow
a
more
accurate
representation
of
the
protease
specificity
of
approximately
38
proteases
and
training
of
the
prediction
models
.

Benchmarking
experiments
using
cross-validation
and
independent
tests
showed
that
iProt-Sub
is
able
to
achieve
a
better
performance
than
several
existing
generic
tools
.

We
anticipate
that
iProt-Sub
will
be
a
powerful
tool
for
proteome-wide
prediction
of
protease-specific
substrates
and
their
cleavage
sites
,
and
will
facilitate
hypothesis-driven
functional
interrogation
of
protease-specific

and

Interferon-inducible
transmembrane
(
IFITM
)
proteins
restrict
the
entry
processes
of
several
pathogenic
viruses
,
including
the
flaviviruses
West
Nile
virus
and
dengue
virus
(
DENV
)
.

DENV
infects
cells
directly
or
via
antibody-dependent
enhancement
(
ADE
)
in
Fc-receptor-bearing
cells
,
a
process
thought
to
contribute
to
severe
disease
in
a
secondary
infection
.

Here
we
investigated
whether
ADE-mediated
DENV
infection
bypasses
IFITM-mediated
restriction
or
whether
IFITM
proteins
can
be
protective
in
a
secondary
infection
.

We
observed
that
IFITM
proteins
restricted
ADE-mediated
and
direct
infection
with
comparable
efficiencies
in
a
myelogenous
leukemia
cell
line
.

Our
data
suggest
that
IFITM
proteins
can
contribute
to
control
of
secondary
DENV
infections
.

Since
their
discovery
as
a
tool
for
gene
transfer
,
vectors
derived
from
the
adeno-associated
virus
(
AAV
)
have
been
used
for
gene
therapy
applications
and
attracted
scientist
to
this
field
for
their
exceptional
properties
of
efficiency
of
in
vivo
gene
transfer
and
the
level
and
duration
of
transgene
expression
.

For
many
years
,
AAVs
have
been
considered
as
low
immunogenic
vectors
due
to
their
ability
to
induce
long-term
expression
of
non-selfproteins
in
contrast
to
what
has
been
observed
with
other
viral
vectors
,
such
as
adenovirus
,
for
which
strong
immune
responses
against
the
same
transgene
products
were
documented
.

The
perceived
low
immunogenicity
likely
explains
why
the
use
of
AAV
vectors
for
vaccination
was
not
seriously
considered
before
the
early
2000s
.

Indeed
,
while
analyses
conducted
using
a
variety
of
transgenes
and
animal
species
slowly
changed
the
vision
of
immunological
properties
of
AAVs
,
an
increasing
number
of
studies
were
also
performed
in
the
field
of
vaccination
.

Even
if
the
comparison
with
other
modes
of
vaccination
was
not
systemically
performed
,
the
analyses
conducted
so
far
in
the
field
of
active
immunotherapy
strongly
suggest
that
AAVs
possess
some
interesting
features
to
be
used
as
tools
to
produce
an
efficient
and
sustained
antibody
response
.

In
addition
,
recent
studies
also
highlighted
the
potential
of
AAVs
for
passive
immunotherapy
.

This
review
summarizes
the
main
studies
conducted
to
evaluate
the
potential
of
AAV
vectors
for
vaccination
against
infectious
agents
and
discusses
their
advantages
and
drawbacks
.

Altogether
,
the
variety
of
studies
conducted
in
this
field
contributes
to
the
understanding
of
the
immunological
properties
of
this
versatile
virus
and
to
the
definition
of
its
possible
future
applications
.

Growing
experimental
evidence
indicates
that
,
in
addition
to
the
physical
virion
components
,
the
non-structural
proteins
of
hepatitis
C
virus
(
HCV
)
are
intimately
involved
in
orchestrating
morphogenesis
.

Since
it
is
dispensable
for
HCV
RNA
replication
,
the
non-structural
viral
protein
NS2
is
suggested
to
play
a
central
role
in
HCV
particle
assembly
.

However
,
despite
genetic
evidences
,
we
have
almost
no
understanding
about
NS2
protein-protein
interactions
and
their
role
in
the
production
of
infectious
particles
.

Here
,
we
used
co-immunoprecipitation
and/or
fluorescence
resonance
energy
transfer
with
fluorescence
lifetime
imaging
microscopy
analyses
to
study
the
interactions
between
NS2
and
the
viroporin
p7
and
the
HCV
glycoprotein
E2
.

In
addition
,
we
used
alanine
scanning
insertion
mutagenesis
as
well
as
other
mutations
in
the
context
of
an
infectious
virus
to
investigate
the
functional
role
of
NS2
in
HCV
assembly
.

Finally
,
the
subcellular
localization
of
NS2
and
several
mutants
was
analyzed
by
confocal
microscopy
.

Our
data
demonstrate
molecular
interactions
between
NS2
and
p7
and
E2
.

Furthermore
,
we
show
that
,
in
the
context
of
an
infectious
virus
,
NS2
accumulates
over
time
in
endoplasmic
reticulum-derived
dotted
structures
and
colocalizes
with
both
the
envelope
glycoproteins
and
components
of
the
replication
complex
in
close
proximity
to
the
HCV
core
protein
and
lipid
droplets
,
a
location
that
has
been
shown
to
be
essential
for
virus
assembly
.

We
show
that
NS2
transmembrane
region
is
crucial
for
both
E2
interaction
and
subcellular
localization
.

Moreover
,
specific
mutations
in
core
,
envelope
proteins
,
p7
and
NS5A
reported
to
abolish
viral
assembly
changed
the
subcellular
localization
of
NS2
protein
.

Together
,
these
observations
indicate
that
NS2
protein
attracts
the
envelope
proteins
at
the
assembly
site
and
it
crosstalks
with
non-structural
proteins
for
virus
assembly
.

Background
:
Pandemic
influenza
A
(
H1N1
)
virus
emerged
in
North
America
in
April
2009
and
spread
globally
.

We
describe
the
epidemiology
and
public
health
response
to
the
first
known
outbreak
of
2009
H1N1
in
a
train
,
which
occurred
in
June
2009
in
China
.

Methods
:
After
2
provinces
provided
initial
reports
of
2009
H1N1
infection
in
2
persons
who
had
travelled
on
the
same
train
,
we
conducted
a
retrospective
epidemiologic
investigation
to
collect
information
from
the
passengers
,
crew
members
,
contacts
,
and
health
care
providers
.

We
explored
the
source
of
infection
and
possible
routes
of
transmission
in
the
train
.

All
cases
were
confirmed
by
real-time
reverse
transcription
polymerase
chain
reaction
testing
.

Results
:
Train
#
1223
traveled
40
hours
,
made
28
stops
in
4
Chinese
provinces
,
and
boarded
2555
passengers
,
who
logged
a
total
of
59
144
person-hours
of
travel
time
.

Nineteen
confirmed
2009
H1N1
cases
were
identified
.

Of
these
,
13
were
infected
and
developed
symptoms
on
the
train
and
6
occurred
among
contacts
who
developed
illness
during
medical
monitoring
.

In
addition
,
3
asymptomatic
cases
were
identified
based
on
RT-PCR
testing
of
respiratory
swabs
from
contacts
.

The
attack
rate
among
contacts
of
confirmed
cases
in
the
same
car
was
higher
than
that
among
contacts
in
other
cars
(
3.15
%
vs.
0
%
,
P
<
0.001
)
.

Attack
rates
increased
with
exposure
time
.

Conclusions
:
Close
contact
and
long
exposure
may
have
contributed
to
the
transmission
of
2009
H1N1
virus
in
the
train
.

Trains
may
have
played
an
important
role
in
the
2009
influenza
pandemic
.

In
recent
years
,
many
studies
have
shown
that
recombinant
adenovirus
live
vector-based
vaccines
are
a
promising
novel
vaccine
candidate
against
virus
infection
.

erefore
,
in
this
study
,
a
new
type
of
recombinant
adenovirus
expressing
the
spike
(
S
)
protein
of
porcine
epidemic
diarrhea
virus
(
PEDV
)
,
rAd-PEDV-S
,
was
generated
,
and
its
characteristics
were
determined
.

en
,
its
efficacy
as
a
vaccine
candidate
was
evaluated
in
4-week-old
pigs
.

e
results
showed
that
the
S
protein
could
be
well
expressed
at
a
high
level
in
rAd-PEDV-S-infected
cells
and
that
the
viral
titers
could
reach
10
11
PFU/mL
.

Further
animal
experimental
results
showed
that
rAd-PEDV-S
elicited
a
significant
PEDV-specific
humoral
immune
response
after
vaccination
(
P
<
0.05
)
.

In
addition
,
rAd-PEDV-S
provided
partial
protection
for
pigs
against
the
highly
virulent
PEDV
challenge
.

e
results
presented
in
this
study
indicate
that
the
adenovirus
vector
can
be
used
as
a
vaccine
delivery
vector
for
the
development
of
a
PEDV
vaccine
and
is
a
promising
novel
vaccine
candidate
for
future
prevention
and
control
of
porcine
epidemic
diarrhea
(
PED
)
,
but
its
efficacy
still
needs
to
be
improved
in
the
future
.

Background
:
The
four
types
of
human
parainfluenza
viruses
(
PIV
)
are
important
causes
of
community-acquired
pneumonia
,
particularly
in
children
;
however
,
limited
information
exists
about
the
incidence
of
PIV
in
critically
ill
patients
.

The
aim
of
this
study
is
to
describe
the
spectrum
,
incidence
and
clinical
features
of
PIV-associated
infections
diagnosed
during
the
hospital
stay
of
patients
admitted
to
pediatric
intensive
care
unit
(
PICU
)
and
intensive
care
unit
(
ICU
)
of
5
medical
centers
across
Kuwait
.

Methods
:
This
was
a
population-based
,
retrospective
study
from
2013
to
2015
.

Specimens
were
analyzed
by
molecular
methods
.

This
analysis
was
performed
using
the
database
of
Virology
Unit
,
Mubarak
Al-Kabeer
Hospital
.

Data
from
1510
admitted
patients
with
suspected
respiratory
viral
infections
was
extracted
.

Results
:
The
database
contained
a
total
of
39
(
2.6
%
)
patients
infected
with
PIV
(
53.8
%
male
and
46.2
%
females
)
and
20
(
51.3
%
)
were
under
1
year
of
age
.

The
most
frequently
isolated
type
was
type
3
(
28
,
71.8
%
)
followed
by
type
1
(
9
,
23.1
%
)
.

At
admission
the
most
common
clinical
diagnosis
was
pneumonia
in
12
patients
(
30.8
%
,
p
<
0.05
)
followed
by
bronchiolitis
in
10
patients
(
25.6
%
)
.

Conclusion
:
PIV
plays
an
important
yet
unrecognized
role
in
the
outcomes
of
PIUC
and
ICU
patients
.

Our
results
contribute
to
the
limited
epidemiologic
data
of
PIV
in
PIUC
and
ICU
in
this
region
.

Background
:
Influenza
is
a
zoonotic
disease
that
infects
millions
of
people
each
year
resulting
in
hundreds
of
thousands
of
deaths
,
and
in
turn
devastating
pandemics
.

Influenza
is
caused
by
influenza
viruses
,
including
influenza
A
virus
(
IAV
)
.

There
are
many
subtypes
of
IAV
but
only
a
few
seem
to
be
able
to
adapt
to
humans
and
to
cause
disease
.

In
2013
,
an
H7N9
IAV
subtype
emerged
in
China
that
does
not
cause
clinical
symptoms
in
its
chicken
host
but
leads
to
severe
infections
when
transmitted
into
humans
.

Since
2013
,
there
have
been
six
epidemic
waves
of
H7N9
with
1567
laboratory-confirmed
human
infections
and
615
deaths
.

Pathogenicity
of
IAV
is
complex
,
but
a
crucial
feature
contributing
to
virulence
is
the
activation
of
the
hemagglutinin
(
HA
)
fusion
protein
by
host
proteases
that
triggers
membrane
fusion
and
leads
to
subsequent
virus
propagation
.

:
293T
,
VERO
,
and
MDCK
cells
were
used
to
conduct
Western
blot
analysis
,
immunofluorescence
assays
,
and
pseudoparticle
and
live
virus
infections
,
and
to
evaluate
H7N9
HA
cleavage-activation
.

Results/Conclusions
:
We
show
that
human
matriptase/ST
14
is
able
to
cleave
H7N9
HA
.

Cleavage
of
H7N9
HA
expressed
in
cell
culture
results
in
fusogenic
HA
and
syncytia
formation
.

In
infection
studies
with
viral
pseudoparticles
carrying
matriptase/
ST
14-activated
H7N9
HA
,
we
observed
a
high
infectivity
of
cells
.

Finally
,
human
matriptase/ST
14
also
activated
H7N9
live
virus
which
resulted
in
high
infectivity
.

Our
data
demonstrate
that
human
matriptase/ST
14
is
a
likely
candidate
protease
to
promote
H7N9
infections
in
humans
.

Middle
East
respiratory
syndrome
coronavirus
(
MERS-CoV
)
induces
severe
aggravating
respiratory
failure
in
infected
patients
,
frequently
resulting
in
mechanical
ventilation
.

As
limited
therapeutic
antibody
is
accumulated
in
lung
tissue
following
systemic
administration
,
inhalation
is
newly
recognized
as
an
alternative
,
possibly
better
,
route
of
therapeutic
antibody
for
pulmonary
diseases
.

The
nebulization
process
,
however
,
generates
diverse
physiological
stresses
,
and
thus
,
the
therapeutic
antibody
must
be
resistant
to
these
stresses
,
remain
stable
,
and
form
minimal
aggregates
.

We
first
isolated
a
MERS-CoV
neutralizing
antibody
that
is
reactive
to
the
receptor-binding
domain
(
RBD
)
of
spike
(
S
)
glycoprotein
.

To
increase
stability
,
we
introduced
mutations
into
the
complementarity-determining
regions
(
CDRs
)
of
the
antibody
.

In
the
HCDRs
(
excluding
HCDR3
)
in
this
clone
,
two
hydrophobic
residues
were
replaced
with
Glu
,
two
residues
were
replaced
with
Asp
,
and
four
residues
were
replaced
with
positively
charged
amino
acids
.

In
LCDRs
,
only
two
Leu
residues
were
replaced
with
Val
.

These
modifications
successfully
generated
a
clone
with
significantly
greater
stability
and
equivalent
reactivity
and
neutralizing
activity
following
nebulization
compared
to
the
original
clone
.

In
summary
,
we
generated
a
MERS-CoV
neutralizing
human
antibody
that
is
reactive
to
recombinant
MERS-CoV
S
RBD
protein
for
delivery
via
a
pulmonary
route
by
introducing
stabilizing
mutations
into
five
CDRs
.

Nonstructural
protein
5A
(
NS5A
)
of
hepatitis
C
virus
(
HCV
)
serves
dual
functions
in
viral
RNA
replication
and
virus
assembly
.

Here
,
we
demonstrate
that
HCV
replication
complex
along
with
NS5A
and
Core
protein
was
transported
to
the
lipid
droplet
(
LD
)
through
microtubules
,
and
NS5A-Core
complexes
were
then
transported
from
LD
through
early-to-late
endosomes
to
the
plasma
membrane
via
microtubules
.

Further
studies
by
cofractionation
analysis
and
immunoelectron
microscopy
of
the
released
particles
showed
that
NS5A-Core
complexes
,
but
not
NS4B
,
were
present
in
the
low-density
fractions
,
but
not
in
the
high-density
fractions
,
of
the
HCV
RNA-containing
virions
and
associated
with
the
internal
virion
core
.

Furthermore
,
exosomal
markers
CD63
and
CD81
were
also
detected
in
the
low-density
fractions
,
but
not
in
the
high-density
fractions
.

Overall
,
our
results
suggest
that
HCV
NS5A
is
associated
with
the
core
of
the
low-density
virus
particles
which
exit
the
cell
through
a
preexisting
endosome/exosome
pathway
and
may
contribute
to
HCV
natural
infection
.

Unlike
canonical
pre-mRNAs
,
animal
replication-dependent
histone
pre-mRNAs
lack
introns
and
are
processed
at
the
3'-end
by
a
mechanism
distinct
from
cleavage
and
polyadenylation
.

They
have
a
3
'
stem
loop
and
histone
downstream
element
(
HDE
)
that
are
recognized
by
stem-loop
binding
protein
(
SLBP
)
and
U7
snRNP
,
respectively
.

The
N-terminal
domain
(
NTD
)
of
Lsm11
,
a
component
of
U7
snRNP
,
interacts
with
FLASH
NTD
and
these
two
proteins
recruit
the
histone
cleavage
complex
containing
the
CPSF-73
endonuclease
for
the
cleavage
reaction
.

Here
,
we
determined
crystal
structures
of
FLASH
NTD
and
found
that
it
forms
a
coiled-coil
dimer
.

Using
solution
light
scattering
,
we

Biochemical

The

The

U7

consists
of
two

a
unique

the
spliceosomal
SmD1

The
U7

SLBP

Through

in
regulation
of

of
several
genes

Subsequent
studies
showed
that
FLASH
localizes
to
Histone
Locus

in
the
nucleus
,
suggesting
a
role
in
expression
of

and
that
it
is
essential
for

Biochemical
studies
revealed
that
the
interacting
N-terminal
regions
of

form
a
docking
platform
that
recruits
the

Mutational
studies

identified
an
LDLY

as
essential

The
molecular
details
of
how
FLASH
acts
as
a

To
shed
some
light

role
of
FLASH
in
3'-end
processing
of
replicationdependent

we
carried
out
structural
studies
on
the
human
FLASH
N-terminal
domain

)
encompassing
residues
51-137
using
X-ray

We
also
performed
biophysical
studies
on
the
FLASH
NTD
and
the
FLASH

NTD
complex
to
characterize
their
oligomeric
states
and
the
stoichiometry
of
their
complex
.

Results
We
determined
a
structure
of
the
wild-type
human
FLASH
NTD
at
2.6
Å
resolution
using
Xray
crystallography
(
Table

)
.

The
initial
phases
were
obtained
by
the
single
anomalous
dispersion
(
SAD
)
method
using
crystals
of
selenomethionyl
FLASH
NTD
.

The
structure
showed
that
FLASH
NTD
forms
a
coiled-coil
dimer
consisting
of
two
parallel
α-helices
,
one
from
each
protomer
(
Fig
2A
)
.

However
,
only
residues
71
to
137
were
observed
in
this
structure
,
even
though
the
expression
construct
contained
residues
51-137
.

Residues
51-70
,
which
include
the
LDLY
motif
previously
shown
to
be
essential
for
histone
pre-mRNA
processing
[
28
]
and
for
binding
the
HCC
[
22
]
,
are
disordered
in
this
crystal
.

The
first
30
residues
of
FLASH
are
poorly
conserved
among
homologs
(
Fig
1B
)
,
although
there
is
substantial
conservation
from
Drosophila
to
mammals
for
residues
55-137
in
the
N-terminal
segment
.

The
N-terminal
domains
of
FLASH
and

Currently

Here

antiviral
classes
against

After
the

assess

compounds
directly
against

protease

Using
this

we
identified
quercetagetin

activity

also
demonstrate

of
FCV

Using

PPNDS
,
quercetagetin

GC376
did
not
display
antivirals

however
,
we
identified
nitazoxanide

as
potent
inhibitors
of
FCV

in
the
low
micromolar
range

In

we
established
two

that
will
accelerate
the

Using
purified
recombinant
Pro-Pol
,
we
established
two
in
vitro
assays
for
the
screening
of
new
FCV
antiviral
compounds
.

Representative
nucleoside
analogues
(
NAs
)
,
non-nucleoside
inhibitors
(
NNIs
)
,
PIs
,
and
the
broad-spectrum
nitazoxanide
,
were
tested
for
FCV
antiviral
activity
using
both
in
vitro
enzyme
and
cell
culture-based
methods
.

Here
we
identify
two
antiviral
agents
as
potential
therapeutic
options
for
the
FCV
infection
.

Background
:
Cytotoxic
T
cell
(
CTL
)
cross-reactivity
is
believed
to
play
a
pivotal
role
in
generating
immune
responses
but
the
extent
and
mechanisms
of
CTL
cross-reactivity
remain
largely
unknown
.

Several
studies
suggest
that
CTL
clones
can
recognize
highly
diverse
peptides
,
some
sharing
no
obvious
sequence
identity
.

The
emerging
realization
in
the
field
is
that
T
cell
receptors
(
TcR
)
recognize
multiple
distinct
ligands
.

Principal
Findings
:
First
,
we
analyzed
peptide
scans
of
the
HIV
epitope
SLFNTVATL
(
SFL9
)
and
found
that
TCR
specificity
is
position
dependent
and
that
biochemically
similar
amino
acid
substitutions
do
not
drastically
affect
recognition
.

Inspired
by
this
,
we
developed
a
general
model
of
TCR
peptide
recognition
using
amino
acid
similarity
matrices
and
found
that
such
a
model
was
able
to
predict
the
cross-reactivity
of
a
diverse
set
of
CTL
epitopes
.

With
this
model
,
we
were
able
to
demonstrate
that
seemingly
distinct
T
cell
epitopes
,
i.e.
,
ones
with
low
sequence
identity
,
are
in
fact
more
biochemically
similar
than
expected
.

Additionally
,
an
analysis
of
HIV
immunogenicity
data
with
our
model
showed
that
CTLs
have
the
tendency
to
respond
mostly
to
peptides
that
do
not
resemble
self-antigens
.

Conclusions
:
T
cell
cross-reactivity
can
thus
,
to
an
extent
greater
than
earlier
appreciated
,
be
explained
by
amino
acid
similarity
.

currently

CHIKV
causes
acute
flu-like
symptoms
and
in
many
cases
prolonged
musculoskeletal

Influenza

Interventions
designed
to
prevent
the
spread
of
respiratory
infection
within
family
physician
(
FP
)
offices
could
potentially
have
a
significant
positive
influence
on
the
health
of
Canadians
.

The
main
purpose
of
this
paper
is
to
estimate
the
explicit
costs
of
such
an
intervention
.

A
cost
analysis
of
a
respiratory
infection
control
was
conducted
.

The
costs
were
estimated
from
the
perspective
of
provincial
government
.

In
addition
,
a
threshold
analysis
was
conducted
to
estimate
a
threshold
value
of
the
intervention
's
effectiveness
that
could
generate
potential
savings
in
terms
of
averted
health-care
costs
by
the
intervention
that
exceed
the
explicit
costs
.

The
informational
requirements
for
these
implicit
costs
savings
are
high
,
however
.

Some
of
these
elements
,
such
as
the
cost
of
hospitalization
in
the
event
of
contacting
influenza
,
and
the
number
of
patients
passing
through
the
physicians
'
office
,
were
readily
available
.

Other
pertinent
points
of
information
,
such
as
the
proportion
of
infected
people
who
require
hospitalization
,
could
be
imported
from
the
existing
literature
.

We
take
an
indirect
approach
to
calculate
a
threshold
value
for
the
most
uncertain
piece
of
information
,
namely
the
reduction
in
the
probability
of
the
infection
spreading
as
a
direct
result
of
the
intervention
,
at
which
the
intervention
becomes
worthwhile
.

The
5-week
intervention
costs
amounted
to
a
total
of
$
52,810.71
,
or
$
131,094.73
prorated
according
to
the
length
of
the
flu
season
,
or
$
512,729.30
prorated
for
the
entire
calendar
year
.

The
variable
costs
that
were
incurred
for
this
5-week
project
amounted
to
approximately
$
923.16
per
participating
medical
practice
.

The
(
fixed
)
training
costs
per
practice
were
equivalent
to
$
73.27
for
the
5week
intervention
,
or
$
28.14
for
13-week
flu
season
,
or
$
7.05
for
an
entire
one-year
period
.

Conclusion
:
Based
on
our
conservative
estimates
for
the
direct
cost
savings
,
there
are
indications
that
the
outreach
facilitation
intervention
program
would
be
cost
effective
if
it
can
achieve
a
reduction
in
the
probability
of
infection
on
the
order
of
0.83
(
0.77
,
1.05
)
percentage

.

initiative
tailored
to
the
environment
and
needs
of
the
family
medical
practice
and
walk-in
clinics
is
of
promise
for
improving
respiratory
infection
control

Background
:
Toxoplasma
gondii
is
an
obligate
intracellular
protozoan
parasite
that
can
infect
mammalian
cells
and
thereby
regulate
host
gene
expression
.

The
long
non-coding
RNAs
(
lncRNAs
)
have
been
demonstrated
to
be
an
important
class
of
RNA
molecules
that
regulate
many
biological
processes
,
including
host-pathogen
interactions
.

However
,
the
role
of
host
lncRNAs
in
the
response
to
T.
gondii
infection
remains
largely
unknown
.

Methods
:
We
applied
a
microarray
approach
to
determine
the
differential
expression
profiles
of
both
lncRNAs
and
mRNAs
in
the
human
foreskin
fibroblast
(
HFF
)
cells
after
T.
gondii
infection
.

The
Gene
Ontology
and
Kyoto
Encyclopedia
of
Genes
and
Genomes
(
KEGG
)
pathway
analyses
were
performed
to
reveal
the
potential
functions
of
T.
gondii-induced
genes
.

Based
on
the
co-expression
networks
of
lncRNAs
and
immune-related
genes
,
the
role
of
NONSHAT022487
on
the
regulation
of
UNC93B1
related
immune
signaling
was
investigated
by
the
knockdown
and
over-expression
of
lncRNA
in
human
macrophage
derived
from
the
PMA-induced
promonocytic
cell
line
THP-1
.

Results
:
Our
data
showed
that
996
lncRNAs
and
109
mRNAs
in
HFF
cells
were
significantly
and
differentially
expressed
following
T.
gondii
infection
(
fold
change
≥
5
,
P
<
0.05
)
.

The
results
from
the
GO
and
KEGG
pathway
analyses
indicated
that
the
mRNAs
with
differential
expression
were
mainly
involved
in
the
host
immune
response
.

Remarkably
,
we
identified
a
novel
lncRNA
,
NONSHAT022487
,
which
suppresses
the
expression
of
the
immunerelated
molecule
UNC93B1
.

After
T.
gondii
infection
,
NONSHAT022487
impaired
the
secretion
of
the
cytokines
IL-12
,
TNF-α
,
IL-1β
and
IFN-γ

Conclusions
:
Our
study
identified
infection-induced
lncRNA
expression
as
a
novel
mechanism
by
which
the
Toxoplasma
parasite
regulates
host
immune
signaling
,
which
advances
our
understanding
of
the
interaction
of
T.
gondii
parasites
and
host
cells
.

The
aim
of
the
present
study
is
to
apply
simple
ODE
models
in
the
area
of
modeling
the
spread
of
emerging
infectious
diseases
and
show
the
importance
of
model
selection
in
estimating
parameters
,
the
basic
reproduction
number
,
turning
point
,
and
final
size
.

To
quantify
the
plausibility
of
each
model
,
given
the
data
and
the
set
of
four
models
including
Logistic
,
Gompertz
,
Rosenzweg
,
and
Richards
models
,
the
Bayes
factors
are
calculated
and
the
precise
estimates
of
the
best
fitted
model
parameters
and
key
epidemic
characteristics
have
been
obtained
.

In
particular
,
for
Ebola

basic
reproduction
numbers
are

,
and
Sierra

,
respectively
.

The
main
results
confirm
that
model
selection
is
crucial
in
evaluating
and
predicting
the
important
quantities
describing
the
emerging
infectious
diseases
,
and
arbitrarily
picking
a
model
without
any
consideration
of
alternatives
is
problematic
.

Since
its
emergence
in
the
1990s
,
White
Spot
Disease
(
WSD
)
has
had
major
economic
and
societal
impact
in
the
crustacean
aquaculture
sector
.

Over
the
years
shrimp
farming
alone
has
experienced
billion
dollar
losses
through
WSD
.

The
disease
is
caused
by
the
White
Spot
Syndrome
Virus
(
WSSV
)
,
a
large
dsDNA
virus
and
the
only
member
of
the
Nimaviridae
family
.

Susceptibility
to
WSSV
in
a
wide
range
of
crustacean
hosts
makes
it
a
major
risk
factor
in
the
translocation
of
live
animals
and
in
commodity
products
.

Currently
there
are
no
effective
treatments
for
this
disease
.

Understanding
the
molecular
basis
of
disease
processes
has
contributed
significantly
to
the
treatment
of
many
human
and
animal
pathogens
,
and
with
a
similar
aim
considerable
efforts
have
been
directed
towards
understanding
host-pathogen
molecular
interactions
for
WSD
.

Work
on
the
molecular
mechanisms
of
pathogenesis
in
aquatic
crustaceans
has
been
restricted
by
a
lack
of
sequenced
and
annotated
genomes
for
host
species
.

Nevertheless
,
some
of
the
key
host-pathogen
interactions
have
been
established
:
between
viral
envelope
proteins
and
host
cell
receptors
at
initiation
of
infection
,
involvement
of
various
immune
system
pathways
in
response
to
WSSV
,
and
the
roles
of
various
host
and
virus
miRNAs
in
mitigation
or
progression
of
disease
.

Despite
these
advances
,
many
fundamental
knowledge
gaps
remain
;
for
example
,
the
roles
of
the
majority
of
WSSV
proteins
are
still
unknown
.

In
this
review
we
assess
current
knowledge
of
how
WSSV
infects
and
replicates
in
its
host
,
and
critique
strategies
for
WSD
treatment
.

An
acute
outbreak
of
porcine
hemagglutinating
encephalomyelitis
virus
(
PHEV
)
infection
in
piglets
,
characterized
with
neurological
symptoms
,
vomiting
,
diarrhea
,
and
wasting
,
occurred
in
China
.

Coronavirus-like
particles
were
observed
in
the
homogenized
tissue
suspensions
of
the
brain
of
dead
piglets
by
electron
microscopy
,
and
a
wild
PHEV
strain
was
isolated
,
characterized
,
and
designated
as
PHEV-CC14
.

Histopathologic
examinations
of
the
dead
piglets
showed
characteristics
of
nonsuppurative
encephalitis
,
and
some
neurons
in
the
cerebral
cortex
were
degenerated
and
necrotic
,
and
neuronophagia
.

Similarly
,
mice
inoculated
with
PHEV-CC14
were
found
to
have
central
nervous
system
(
CNS
)
dysfunction
,
with
symptoms
of
depression
,
arched
waists
,
standing
and
vellicating
front
claws
.

Furthmore
,
PHEV-positive
labeling
of
neurons
in
cortices
of
dead
piglets
and
infected
mice
supported
the
viral
infections
of
the
nervous
system
.

Then
,
the
major
structural
genes
of
PHEV-CC14
were
sequenced
and
phylogenetically
analyzed
,
and
the
strain
shared
95
%
-99.2
%
nt
identity
with
the
other
PHEV
strains
available
in
GenBank
.

Phylogenetic
analysis
clearly
proved
that
the
wild
strain
clustered
into
a
subclass
with
a
HEV-JT06
strain
.

These
findings
suggested
that
the
virus
had
a
strong
tropism
for
CNS
,
in
this
way
,
inducing
nonsuppurative
encephalitis
as
the
cause
of
death
in
piglets
.

Simultaneously
,
the
predicted
risk
of
widespread
transmission
showed
a
certain
variation
among
the
PHEV
strains
currently
circulating
around
the
world
.

Above
all
,
the
information
presented
in
this
study
can
not
only
provide
good
reference
for
the

,
74
antibody-based

have
been
approved
by
a

being
discovered
each

.

For
oncology
,
many
of
the

involve
antibody

Finally
,

864
antibody-based

,
with
incredible

wave
of
novel

new

DExD/H-box
helicase
36
(

is
known
to
be
an
ATP-dependent
RNA
helicase
that
unwinds
the
guanine-quadruplexes
DNA
or
RNA
,

that
it
also

Porcine
reproductive

syndrome
virus
(
PRRSV
)
is
an
Arterivirus
that
has
been
devastating
the
swine
industry
worldwide
.

Interstitial
pneumonia
is
considered
to
be
one
of
the
most
obvious
clinical
signs
of
PRRSV
infection
,
suggesting
that
the
inflammatory
response
plays
an
important
role
in
PRRSV
pathogenesis
.

However
,
whether
DHX36
is
involved
in
PRRSVinduced
inflammatory
cytokine
expression
remains
unclear
.

In
this
study
,
we
found
that
PRRSV
infection
increased
the
expression
of
DHX36
.

gene

cells
significantly
reduced
NF-κB
activation
and
pro-inflammatory
cytokine
expression
after
PRRSV
infection
.

Further
investigation
revealed
that
PRRSV
nucleocapsid
protein
interacted
with
the
N-terminal
quadruplex
binding
domain
of
DHX36
,
which
in
turn
augmented
nucleocapsid
protein-induced
NF-κB
activation
.

Taken
together
,
our
results
suggest
that
DHX36-MyD88
has
a
relevant
role
in
the
recognition
of
PRRSV
nucleocapsid
protein
and
in
the
subsequent
activation
of
pro-inflammatory
NF-κB
pathway

Given
the
rapid
rate
of
global
spread

consequently
healthcare
costs

to
influenza
,
surveillance
plays
an
important
role
in
monitoring
the
emerging
pandemics
in
China
.

However
,
the
characteristics
of
influenza
in
Southeast
of
China
have
n't
been
fully
studied
.

Our
study
use
the
surveillance
data
collected
from
16
sentinel
hospitals
across
Zhejiang
Province
during
March
2011
through
June
2015
,
including
the
demographic
information
and
respiratory

As
analysis
results
,
most
SARI

patients
were
in
the
age
group

0-4
years
old
(
62.38
%
of
ILI
and
71.54

.

The
respiratory
specimens
have
statistically
significantly
higher
positive

for
influenza
among
ILI
patients
than
that
among
SARI
patients
(

.

The
comparison
between
ILI
patients
and

patients
shows
no
statistically
significantly
difference
in
detecting
influenza

The
SARI

Our

The

Although

prevention

of
cellular
proteins
,
including
the
cell
cycle
control
protein
pRb
.

In
this
study
,
RNA
aptamers
(
small
,
singlestranded
oligonucleotides
selected
for
high-affinity
binding
)
to
HPV16
E7
were
employed
as
molecular
tools
to
further
investigate
these
protein-protein
interactions
.

This
study
is
focused
on
one
aptamer
(
termed
A2
)
.

Transfection
of
this
molecule
into
HPV16-transformed
cells
resulted
in
inhibition
of
cell
proliferation
(
shown
using
real-time
cell
electronic
sensing
and
MTT
assays
)
due
to
the
induction
of
apoptosis
(
as
demonstrated
by
Annexin
V/propidium
iodide
staining
)
.

GST-pull
down
and
bead
binding
assays
were
used
to
demonstrate
that
the
binding
of
A2
required
N-terminal
residues
of
E7
known
to
be
involved
in
interaction
with
the
cell
cycle
control
protein
,
pRb
.

Using
a
similar
approach
,
A2
was
shown
to
disrupt
the
interaction
between
E7
and
pRb
in
vitro
.

Furthermore
,
transfection
of
HPV16-transformed
cells
with
A2
appeared
to
result
in
the
loss
of
E7
and
rise
in
pRb
levels
,
as
observed
by
immunoblotting
.

Conclusions/Significance
:
This
paper
includes
the
first
characterisation
of
the
effects
of
an
E7
RNA
aptamer
in
a
cell
line
derived
from
a
cervical
carcinoma
.

Transfection
of
cells
with
A2
was
correlated
with
the
loss
of
E7
and
the
induction
of
apoptosis
.

Aptamers
specific
for
a
number
of
cellular
and
viral
proteins
have
been
documented
previously
;
one
aptamer
(
Macugen
)
is
approved
for
clinical
use
and
several
others
are
in
clinical
trials
.

In
addition
to
its
role
as
a
molecular
tool
,
A2
could
have
further
applications
in
the
future
.

Background
:
Allogeneic
hematopoietic
stem
cell
transplantation
(
HSCT
)
is
the
only
curative
treatment
available
for
severe
combined
immunodeficiency
(
SCID
)
;
although
,
there
is
a
high
incidence
of
severe
infections
and
an
increased
risk
of
graft-versus
host-disease
(
GvHD
)
with
HSCT
.

Early
intervention
is
a
crucial
prognostic
factor
and
a
HLA-haploidentical
parental
donor
is
often
available
.

Haploidentical
HSCT
protocols
utilizing
extensively
ex
vivo
T-cell
depleted
grafts
(
CliniMACs
system
)
have
proven
efficient
in
preventing
GvHD
,
but
cause
a
delay
in
early
T-cell
recovery
that
increases
the
risk
of
viral
infections
.

Here
,
we
present
a
novel
approach
for
treating
SCID
that
combines
selective
depletion
of
GvHD-inducing
alpha/beta
(
α/β
)
T-cells
from
the
haploidentical
HSCT
graft
with
a
subsequent
donor
lymphocyte
infusion
(
DLI
)
enriched
for
CD45RO+
memory
T-cells
.

Results
:
Our
patient
was
diagnosed
with
SCID
(
T-B
+
NK+
phenotype
)
.

At
9
months
of
age
,
he
received
a
T
cell
receptor
(
TCR
)
α/β-cell
depleted
graft
from
his
haploidentical
mother
,
following
a
reduced
intensity
conditioning
regimen
with
no
additional
GvHD
prophylaxis
.

Engraftment
was
rapid
with
complete
donor
chimerism
and
no
signs
of
GvHD
.

However
,
at
12
weeks
post
HSCT
,
the
patient
was
still
T-cell
lymphopenic
with
clinical
symptoms
of
multiple
severe
viral
infections
.

Consequently
,
therapeutic
DLIs
were
initiated
for
enhanced
anti-viral
immunity
.

The
patient
was
treated
with
CD45RA+
depleted
haploidentical
maternal
donor
lymphocytes
enriched
from
unmobilized
whole
blood
,
and
a
total
T-cell
dose
of
no
more
than
25
x10
3
CD3+
cells/kg
with
>
99.9
%
purity
of
CD3
+
CD45RO+
memory
T-cells
was
transferred
.

Following
the
DLI
,
a
prompt
increase
in
CD3
+
CD4+
and
CD3
+
CD8+
counts
was
observed
with
a
subsequent
clearance
of
viral
infections
.

No
acute
or
chronic
GvHD
was
observed
.

Conclusions
:
Automated
depletion
of
CD45RA+
naïve
T-cells
from
unmobilized
whole
blood
is
a
simple
and
rapid
strategy
to
provide
unmanipulated
DLIs
,
with
a
potentially
broad
repertoire
of
pathogen
specific
memory
T-cells
.

In
the
haploidentical
setting
,
CD45RA+
depleted
DLIs
can
be
safely
administered
at
low
T-cell
doses
for
efficient
enhancement
of
viral
immunity
and
limited
risk
of
GvHD
.

We
demonstrate
the
successful
use
of
this
approach
following
TCR-α/β-cell
depleted
HSCT
for
the
treatment
of
SCID
.

ORF4b
antagonizes
the
early
antiviral
alpha/beta
interferon
(
IFN-α/β
)
response
,
which
may
significantly
contribute
to
MERS-CoV
pathogenesis
;
however
,
the
underlying
mechanism
is
poorly
understood
.

Here
,
we
found
that
ORF4b
in
the
cytoplasm
could
specifically
bind
to
TANK
binding
kinase
1
(
TBK1
)
and
IκB
kinase
epsilon
(
IKKε
)
,
suppress
the
molecular
interaction
between
mitochondrial
antiviral
signaling
protein
(
MAVS
)
and
IKKε
,
and
inhibit
IFN
regulatory
factor
3
(
IRF3
)
phosphorylation
and
subsequent
IFN-β
production
.

Further
analysis
showed
that
ORF4b
could
also
inhibit
IRF3
and
IRF7-induced
production
of
IFN-β
,
whereas
deletion
of
the
nuclear
localization
signal
of
ORF4b
abrogated
its
ability
to
inhibit
IRF3
and
IRF7-induced
production
of
IFN-β
,
but
not
IFN-β
production
induced
by
RIG-I
,
HCoVs
have
yet
to
be
identified
.

MERS-CoV
ORF4b
antagonizes
the
early
antiviral
response
,
which
may
contribute
to
MERS-CoV
pathogenesis
.

Here
,
we
report
the
identification
of
the
interferon
(
IFN
)
antagonism
mechanism
of
MERS-CoV
ORF4b
.

MERS-CoV
ORF4b
inhibits
the
production
of
type
I
IFN
through
a
direct
interaction
with
IKKε
/TBK1
in
the
cytoplasm
,
and
also
in
the
nucleus
with
unknown
mechanism
.

These
findings
provide
a
rationale
for
the
novel
pathogenesis
of
MERS-CoV
as
well
as
a
basis
for
developing
a
candidate
therapeutic
against
this
virus
.

Interferences
between
pathogenic
bacteria
and
specific
commensals
are
known
.

We
determined
the
interactions
between
nasopharyngeal
microbial
pathogens
and
commensals
during
viral
upper
respiratory
tract
infection
(
URI
)
and
acute
otitis
media
(
AOM
)
in
infants
.

We
analyzed
971
specimens
collected
monthly
and
during
URI
and
AOM
episodes
from
139
infants
.

The
16S
rRNA
V4
gene
regions
were
sequenced
on
the
Illumina
MiSeq
platform
.

Among
the
high
abundant
genus-level
nasopharyngeal
microbiota
were
Moraxella
,
Haemophilus
,
and
Streptococcus
(
3
otopathogen
genera
)
,
Corynebacterium
,
Dolosigranulum
,
Staphylococcus
,
Acinetobacter
,
Pseudomonas
,
and
Bifidobacterium
.

Bacterial
diversity
was
lower
in
culture-positive
samples
for
Streptococcus
pneumoniae
,
and
Haemophilus
influenzae
,
compared
to
cultured-negative
samples
.

URI
frequencies
were
positively
associated
with
increasing
trend
in
otopathogen
colonization
.

AOM
frequencies
were
associated
with
decreasing
trend
in
Micrococcus
colonization
.

During
URI
and
AOM
,
there
were
increases
in
abundance
of
otopathogen
genera
and
decreases
in
Pseudomonas
,
Myroides
,
Yersinia
,
and
Sphingomonas
.

Otopathogen
abundance
was
increased
during
symptomatic
viral
infection
,
but
not
during
asymptomatic
infection
.

The
risk
for
AOM
complicating
URI
was
reduced
by
increased
abundance
of
Staphylococcus
and
Sphingobium
.

Zika
virus
(
ZIKV
)
has
been
associated
with
serious
health
conditions
,
and
an
intense
search
to
discover
different
ways
to
prevent
and
treat
ZIKV
infection
is
underway
.

Berberine
and
emodin
possess
several
pharmacological
properties
and
have
been
shown
to
be
particularly
effective
against
the
entry
and
replication
of
several
viruses
.

We
show
that
emodin
and
berberine
trigger
a
virucidal
effect
on
ZIKV
.

When
the
virus
was
exposed
to
160
µM
of
berberine
,
a
reduction
of
77.6
%
in
the
infectivity
was
observed
;
when
emodin
was
used
(
40
µM
)
,
this
reduction
was
approximately
83.3
%
.

Dynamic
light
scattering
data
showed
that
both
compounds
significantly
reduce
the
hydrodynamic
radius
of
virus
particle
in
solution
.

We
report
here
that
berberine
and
emodin
,
two
natural
compounds
,
have
strong
virucidal
effect
in
Zika
virus
.

Infectious
diseases
are
a
significant
burden
on
public
health
and
economic
stability
of
societies
all
over
the
world
.

They
have
for
centuries
been
among
the
leading
causes
of
death
and
disability
and
presented
growing
challenges
to
health
security
and
human
progress
.

The
threat
posed
by
infectious
diseases
is
further
deepened
by
the
continued
emergence
of
new
,
unrecognized
,
and
old
infectious
disease
epidemics
of
global
impact
.

Over
the
past
three
and
half
decades
at
least
30
new
infectious
agents
affecting
humans
have
emerged
,
most
of
which
are
zoonotic
and
their
origins
have
been
shown
to
correlate
significantly
with
socioeconomic
,
environmental
,
and
ecological
factors
.

As
these
factors
continue
to
increase
,
putting
people
in
increased
contact
with
the
disease
causing
pathogens
,
there
is
concern
that
infectious
diseases
may
continue
to
present
a
formidable
challenge
.

Constant
awareness
and
pursuance
of
effective
strategies
for
controlling
infectious
diseases
and
disease
emergence
thus
remain
crucial
.

This
review
presents
current
updates
on
emerging
and
neglected
infectious
diseases
and
highlights
the
scope
,
dynamics
,
and
advances
in
infectious
disease
management
with
particular
focus
on
WHO
top
priority
emerging
infectious
diseases
(
EIDs
)
and
neglected
tropical
infectious

Strand
exchange
nucleic
acid
circuitry
can
be
used
to
transduce
isothermal
nucleic
acid
amplification
products
into
signals
that
can
be
readable
on
an
off-the-shelf
glucometer
.

Loop-mediated
isothermal
amplification
(
LAMP
)
is
limited
by
the
accumulation
of
non-specific
products
,
but
nucleic
acid
circuitry
can
be
used
to
probe
and
distinguish
specific
amplicons
.

By
combining
this
high
temperature
isothermal
amplification
method
with
a
thermostable
invertase
,
we
can
directly
transduce
Middle-East
respiratory
syndrome
coronavirus
and
Zaire
Ebolavirus
templates
into
glucose
signals
,
with
a
sensitivity
as
low
as
20-100
copies/μ
l
,
equating
to
atto-molar
(
or
low
zepto-mole
)
.

Virus
from
cell
lysates
and
synthetic
templates
could
be
readily
amplified
and
detected
even
in
sputum
or
saliva
.

An
OR
gate
that
coordinately
triggered
on
viral
amplicons
further
guaranteed
fail-safe
virus
detection
.

The
method
describes
has
potential
for
accelerating
point-of-care
applications
,
in
that
biological
samples
could
be
applied
to
a
transducer
that
would
then
directly
interface
with
an
off-the-shelf
,
approved
medical
device
.

The
Middle-East
respiratory
syndrome
coronavirus
(
MERS-CoV
)
belongs
to
the
human
betacoronavirus
family
of
coronaviruses
,
which
are
large
positive-stranded
RNA
viruses
whose
genomes
typically
range
between
~27
to
~31
kb
in
size
.

The
first
case
of
MERS-CoV
infection
was
identified
in
2012
in
a
Saudi
Arabian
patient
who
died
from
a
severe
respiratory
illness
1-3
.

Since
then
,
the
infection
has
spread
globally
and
through
the
middle
of
2014
had
caused
614
laboratory-confirmed
cases
and
181
deaths
2,4,5
.

MERS-CoV
is
thus
one
of
the
most
serious
emergent
viral
pathogens
since
its
relative
,
SARS-CoV
6
.

In
order
to
control
spreading
infections
and
receive
timely
treatment
,
sensitive
and
specific
detection
of
MERS-CoV
at
point-of-need
or
point-of-care
is
extremely
important
.

While
methods
such
as
immunofluorescence
assays
(
targeting
MERS-CoV
N
and
S
proteins
)
7
and
real-time
reverse
transcription
polymerase
chain
reaction
(
RT-PCR
,
targeting
viral
genes
in
or
around
ORF1A
,
ORF1B
and
upE
)
have
been
successfully
used
for
clinical
diagnosis
8-10
,
these
methods
are
not
readily
adapted
to
point-of-care
applications
.

A
simple
molecular
assay
for
MERS-CoV
can
potentially
be
developed
by
relying
on
the
exquisite
sensitivity
and
extreme
simplicity
of
isothermal
amplification
reactions
11-16
,
such
as
loop-mediated
isothermal
amplification
(
LAMP
)
,
which
yields
up
to
10
10
-fold
amplification
within
10
min
to
two
hours
17,18
.

Unfortunately
,
LAMP
also
creates
many
non-specific
amplicons
that
often
yield
false
positive
results
and
because
of
this
its
potential
for
point-of-care
assays
has
not
been
realized
.

We
recently
found
that
sequence-specific
,
nucleic
acid
strand
exchange
reactions
can
be
used
to
efficiently
distinguish
between
specific
and
non-specific
LAMP
amplicons
[
19
]
[
20
]
[
21
]
.

We
now
show
that
LAMP
reactions
can
be
made
user-friendly
and
field-based
by
integrating
LAMP
,
strand

signal
transduction
,
and
a
commercial-off-the-shelf
device
,
a
glucometer
,
for
pathogen
detection
.

The
use
of
glucometers
to
monitor
non-glucose
targets
was
pioneered
by
Lu
's
group
,
who
adapted
this
device
for
aptamer-or
DNAzyme-based
detection
of
cocaine
,
ATP
and
metal
ions
22-25
.

These
and
other
efforts
26-30
inspired
our
more
generalizable
approach
to
molecular
diagnostics
.

The
addition
of
a
thermostable
invertase
allows
all
reactions
to
occur
in
the
same
tube
at
a
wide
temperature
range
,
and
the
simplicity
of
the
format
ultimately
yields
atto-molar
(
or
low
zepto-mole
)
detection
of
pathogens
such
as
MERS-CoV
or
Zaire
Ebolavirus
(
ZEBOV
or
Zaire
Ebola
)
,
even
in
sputum
or
saliva
samples
.

The
strand
exchange
reactions
ensure
low
false
positives
,
while
the
use
of
an
OR
gate
guards
against
false
negative
detection
.

Moreover
,
the
reaction
components
are
modular
and
can
be
readily
adapted
to
different
protocols
covering
different
reaction
temperatures
,
times
,
volumes
,
and
vagaries
of
reagent
storage
.

Respiratory

often
have
been
studied
in

The

respiratory
syndrome
coronavirus
(
MERS-CoV
)
is
a
life-threatening
respiratory
disease
with
a
high
case
fatality
rate
;
however
,
its
risk
factors
remain
unclear
.

We
aimed
to
explore
the
influence
of
demographic
factors
,
clinical
manifestations
and
underlying
comorbidities
on
mortality
in
MERS-CoV
patients
.

Retrospective
chart
reviews
were
performed
to
identify
all
laboratory-confirmed
cases
of
MERS-COV
infection
in
Saudi
Arabia
that
were
reported
to
the
Ministry
of
Health
of
Saudi
Arabia
between
23
April
2014
and
7
June
2016
.

Statistical
analyses
were
conducted
to
assess
the
effect
of
sex
,
age
,
clinical
presentation
and
comorbidities
on
mortality
from
MERS-CoV
.

A
total
of
281
confirmed
MERS-CoV
cases
were
identified
:
167
(
59.4
%
)
patients
were
male
and
55
(
20
%
)
died
.

Mortality
predominantly
occurred
among
Saudi
nationals
and
older
patients
and
was
significantly
associated
with
respiratory
failure
and
shortness
of
breath
.

Of
the
281
confirmed
cases
,
160
(
56.9
%
)
involved
comorbidities
,
wherein
diabetes

,
hypertension
,
ischemic
heart
disease
,
congestive
heart
failure
,
end-stage
renal
disease
and
chronic
kidney
disease
were
significantly
associated
with
mortality
from
MERS-CoV
and
two
or
three
comorbidities
significantly
affected
the
fatality
rates
from
MERS-CoV
.

The
findings
of
this
study
show
that
old
age
and
the
existence
of
underlying
comorbidities
significantly
increase
mortality
from
MERS-CoV
.

Porcine
reproductive
and
respiratory
syndrome
virus
(
PRRSV
)
is
a
positive-stranded
RNA
virus
that
grows
in
macrophages
and
causes
acute
pneumonia
in
pigs
.

PRRSV
causes
devastating
losses
to
the
porcine
industry
.

However
,
due
to
its
high
antigenic
variability
and
poorly
understood
immunopathogenesis
,
there
is
currently
no
effective
vaccine
or
treatment
to
control
PRRSV
infection
.

The
common
occurrence
of
PRRSV
infection
with
bacterial
infections
as
well
as
its
inflammatory-driven
pathobiology
raises
the
question
of
the
value
of
antibiotics
with
immunomodulating
properties
for
the
treatment
of
the
disease
it
causes
.

The
macrolide
antibiotic
Tulathromycin
(
TUL
)
has
been
found
to
exhibit
potent
anti-inflammatory
and
immunomodulating
properties
in
cattle
and
pigs
.

The
aim
of
this
study
was
to
characterize
the
anti-viral
and
immunomodulating
properties
of
TUL
in
PRRSV-infected
porcine
macrophages
.

Our
findings
indicate
that
blood
monocyte-derived
macrophages
are
readily
infected
by
PRRSV
and
can
be
used
as
an
effective
cellular
model
to
study
PRRSV
pathogenesis
.

TUL
did
not
change
intracellular
or
extracellular
viral
titers
,
not
did
it
alter
viral
receptors
(
CD163
and
CD169
)
expression
on
porcine
macrophages
.

In
contrast
,
TUL
exhibited
potent
immunomodulating
properties
,
which
therefore
occurred
in
the
absence
of
any
direct
antiviral
effects
against
PRRSV
.

TUL
had
an
additive
effect
with
PRRSV
on
the
induction
of
macrophage
apoptosis
,
and
inhibited
virus-induced
necrosis
.

TUL
significantly
attenuated
PRRSV-induced
macrophage
pro-inflammatory
signaling
(
CXCL-8
and
mitochondrial
ROS
production
)
and
prevented
PRRSV
inhibition
of
non-opsonized
and
opsonized
phagocytic
function
.

Together
,
these
data
demonstrate
that
TUL
inhibits
PRRSV-induced
inflammatory
responses
in
porcine
macrophages
and
protects
against
the
phagocytic
impairment
caused
by
the
virus
.

Research
in
live
pigs
is
warranted
to
assess
the
potential
clinical
benefits
of
this
antibiotic
in
the
context
of
virally
induced
inflammation
and
tissue
injury

Background
:
The
increasing
population
of
marriage-based
migrant
women
is
disproportionally
affected
by
AIDS/
STDs
in
China
,
and
social
support
plays
a
critical
role
.

This
study
aims
to
describe
the
social
support
level
received
by
married
migrant
women
in
rural
areas
in
Shandong
province
in
comparison
to
non-migrant
local
women
,
identifies
the
relevant
factors
of
this
social
support
condition
among
married
migrant
women
,
and
observes
the
correlation
between
social
support
level
and
infection
status
of
AIDS
and
STDs
among
this
group
.

Methods
:
A
probability-based
sample
of
1,076
migrant
and
1,195
local
women
were
included
in
the
study
.

A
pre-tested
field
questionnaire
was
administered
to
participants
through
a
direct
face-to-face
interview
.

Questionnaire
contained
questions
on
socio-demographic
information
,
AIDS
and
STDs
prevalence
information
and
Social
Support
Rating
Scale
(
SSRS
)
which
measures
objective
support
,
subjective
support
,
and
utilization
of
social
support
.

Results
:
Compared
to
local
women
,
married
migrant
women
had
lower
levels
of
social
support
in
most
dimensions
.

Multi-variable
analysis
revealed
that
relationship
with
spouse
,
family
average
income
,
number
of
children
,
education
,
engagement
and
claimed
reasons
of
moving
have
various
correlations
with
one
or
all
dimensions
of
social
support
scores
.

Higher
social
support
is
also
related
to
awareness
of
infection
status
of
HIV
and
STDs
among
this
group
.

Conclusion
:
Our
findings
provide
further
evidence
that
married
migrant
women
have
lower
levels
of
social
support
which
may
be
related
to
some
social
characteristics
and
their
awareness
status
of
AIDS
and
STDs
infection
status
and
that
targeted
interventions
need
to
be
developed
for
this
population
.

We
designed
and
produced
a
self-assembling
protein
nanoparticle
.

This
self-assembling
protein
nanoparticle
contains
five
CD8
+
HLA-A03-11
supertypes-restricted
epitopes
from
antigens
expressed
during
Toxoplasma
gondii
's
lifecycle
,
the
universal
CD4
+
T
cell
epitope
PADRE
,
and
flagellin
as
a
scaffold
and
TLR5
agonist
.

These
CD8
+
T
cell
epitopes
were
separated
by
N/KAAA
spacers
and
optimized
for
proteasomal
cleavage
.

Self-assembling
protein
nanoparticle
adjuvanted
with
TLR4
ligand-emulsion
GLA-SE
were
evaluated
for
their
efficacy
in
inducing
IFN-γ
responses
and
protection
of
HLA-A*1101
transgenic
mice
against
T.
gondii
.

Immunization
,
using
self-assembling
protein
nanoparticle-GLA-SE
,
activated
CD8
+
T
cells
to
produce
IFN-γ
.

Self-assembling
protein
nanoparticle-GLA-SE
also
protected
HLA-A*1101
transgenic
mice
against
subsequent
challenge
with
Type
II
parasites
.

Hence
,
combining
CD8
+
T
cell-eliciting
peptides
and
PADRE
into
a
multi-epitope
protein
that
forms
a
nanoparticle
,
administered
with
GLA-SE
,
leads
to
efficient
presentation
by
major
histocompatibility
complex
Class
I
and
II
molecules
.

Furthermore
,
these
results
suggest
that
activation
of
TLR4
and
TLR5
could
be
useful
for
development
of
vaccines
that
elicit
T
cells
to
prevent
toxoplasmosis
in
humans
.

A

with
Cohort
1
)
.

In
summary
,
the
two
laboratory
methods
were
comparable
for
the
detection
of
B.
pertussis
.

The
family
Arenaviridae
contains
several
pathogens
of
major
clinical
importance
.

The
Old
World
(
OW
)
arenavirus
Lassa
virus
is
endemic
in
West
Africa
and
is
estimated
to
cause
up
to
300,000
infections
each
year
.

The
New
World
(
NW
)
arenaviruses
Junín
and
Machupo
periodically
cause
hemorrhagic
fever
outbreaks
in
South
America
.

While
these
arenaviruses
are
highly
pathogenic
in
humans
,
recent
evidence
indicates
that
pathogenic
OW
and
NW
arenaviruses
interact
with
the
host
immune
system
differently
,
which
may
have
differential
impacts
on
viral
pathogenesis
.

Severe
Lassa
fever
cases
are
characterized
by
profound
immunosuppression
.

In
contrast
,
pathogenic
NW
arenavirus
infections
are
accompanied
by
elevated
levels
of
Type
I
interferon
and
pro-inflammatory
cytokines
.

This
review
aims
to
summarize
recent
findings
about
interactions
of
these
pathogenic
arenaviruses
with
the
innate
immune
machinery
and
the
subsequent
effects
on
adaptive
immunity
,
which
may
inform
the
development
of
vaccines
and
therapeutics
against
arenavirus
infections
.

To
identify
malaria
antigens
for
vaccine
development
,
we
selected
a-helical
coiled
coil
domains
of
proteins
predicted
to
be
present
in
the
parasite
erythrocytic
stage
.

The
corresponding
synthetic
peptides
are
expected
to
mimic
structurally
``
native
''
epitopes
.

Indeed
the
95
chemically
synthesized
peptides
were
all
specifically
recognized
by
human
immune
sera
,
though
at
various
prevalence
.

Peptide
specific
antibodies
were
obtained
both
by
affinity-purification
from
malaria
immune
sera
and
by
immunization
of
mice
.

These
antibodies
did
not
show
significant
cross
reactions
,
i.e.
,
they
were
specific
for
the
original
peptide
,
reacted
with
native
parasite
proteins
in
infected
erythrocytes
and
several
were
active
in
inhibiting
in
vitro
parasite
growth
.

Circular
dichroism
studies
indicated
that
the
selected
peptides
assumed
partial
or
high
a-helical
content
.

Thus
,
we
demonstrate
that
the
bioinformatics/chemical
synthesis
approach
described
here
can
lead
to
the
rapid
identification
of
molecules
which
target
biologically
active
antibodies
,
thus
identifying
suitable
vaccine
candidates
.

This
strategy
can
be
,
in
principle
,
extended
to
vaccine
discovery
in
a
wide
range
of
other
pathogens
.

Our
current
health
research
enterprise
is
painstakingly
slow
and
cumbersome
,
and
its
results
seldom
translate
into
practice
.

The
slow
pace
of
health
research
contributes
to
findings
that
are
less
relevant
and
potentially
even
obsolete
.

To
produce
more
rapid
,
responsive
,
and
relevant
research
,
we
propose
approaches
that
increase
relevance
via
greater
stakeholder
involvement
,
speed
research
via
innovative
designs
,
streamline
review
processes
,
and
create
and/or
better
leverage
research
infrastructure
.

Broad
stakeholder
input
integrated
throughout
the
research
process
can
both
increase
relevance
and
facilitate
study
procedures
.

More
flexible
and
rapid
research
designs
should
be
considered
before
defaulting
to
the
traditional
two-arm
randomized
controlled
trial
(
RCT
)
,
but
even
traditional
RCTs
can
be
designed
for
more
rapid
findings
.

Review
processes
for
grant
applications
,
IRB
protocols
,
and
manuscript
submissions
can
be
better
streamlined
to
minimize
delays
.

Research
infrastructures
such
as
rapid
learning
systems
and
other
health
information
technologies
can
be
leveraged
to
rapidly
evaluate
new
and
existing
treatments
,
and
alleviate
the
extensive
recruitment
delays
common
in
traditional
research
.

These
and
other
approaches
are
feasible
but
require
a
culture
shift
among
the
research
community
to
value
not
only
methodological
rigor
,
but
also
the
pace
and
relevance
of
research
.

Background
:
Phage
display
is
widely
used
in
basic
research
such
as
the
exploration
of
proteinprotein
interaction
sites
and
networks
,
and
applied
research
such
as
the
development
of
new
drugs
,
vaccines
,
and
diagnostics
.

It
has
also
become
a
promising
method
for
epitope
mapping
.

Research
on
new
algorithms
that
assist
and
automate
phage
display
based
epitope
mapping
has
attracted
many
groups
.

Most
of
the
existing
tools
have
not
been
implemented
as
an
online
service
until
now
however
,
making
it
less
convenient
for
the
community
to
access
,
utilize
,
and
evaluate
them
.

We
present
MIMOX
,
a
free
web
tool
that
helps
to
map
the
native
epitope
of
an
antibody
based
on
one
or
more
user
supplied
mimotopes
and
the
antigen
structure
.

MIMOX
was
coded
in
Perl
using
modules
from
the
Bioperl
project
.

It
has
two
sections
.

In
the
first
section
,
MIMOX
provides
a
simple
interface
for
ClustalW
to
align
a
set
of
mimotopes
.

It
also
provides
a
simple
statistical
method
to
derive
the
consensus
sequence
and
embeds
JalView
as
a
Java
applet
to
view
and
manage
the
alignment
.

In
the
second
section
,
MIMOX
can
map
a
single
mimotope
or
a
consensus
sequence
of
a
set
of
mimotopes
,
on
to
the
corresponding
antigen
structure
and
search
for
all
of
the
clusters
of
residues
that
could
represent
the
native
epitope
.

NACCESS
is
used
to
evaluate
the
surface
accessibility
of
the
candidate
clusters
;
and
Jmol
is
embedded
to
view
them
interactively
in
their
3D
context
.

Initial
case
studies
show
that
MIMOX
can
reproduce
mappings
from
existing
tools
such
as
FINDMAP
and
3DEX
,
as
well
as
providing
novel
,
rational
results
.

A
web-based
tool
called
MIMOX
has
been
developed
for
phage
display
based
epitope
mapping
.

As
a
publicly
available
online
service
in
this
area
,
it
is
convenient
for
the
community
to
access
,
utilize
,
and
evaluate
,
complementing
other
existing
programs
.

MIMOX
is
freely
available
at

There
are
significant
misconceptions
and
many
obstacles
in
the
way
of
illuminating
the
epidemiological
and
clinical
aspects
of
COVID-19
as
a
new
emerging
epidemic
.

In
addition
,
usefulness
of
some
evidence
published
in
the
context
of
the
recent
epidemic
for
decision
making
in
clinic
as
well
as
public
health
is
questionable
.

However
,
misinterpreting
or
ignoring
strong
evidence
in
clinical
practice
and
public
health
probably
results
in
less
effective
and
somehow
more
harmful
decisions
for
individuals
as
well
as
subgroups
in
general
populations
of
countries
in
the
initial
stages
of
this
epidemic
.

Accordingly
,
our
narrative
review
appraised
epidemiological
and
clinical
aspects
of
the
disease
including
genetic
diversity
of
coronavirus
genus
,
mode
of
transmission
,
incubation
period
,
infectivity
,
pathogenicity
,
virulence
,
immunogenicity
,
diagnosis
,
surveillance
,
clinical
case
management
and
also
successful
measures
for
preventing
its
spread
in
some
communities
.

Risk
communication
is
critical
to
emergency
management
.

The
objective
of
this
paper
is
to
illustrate
the
effective
process
and
attention
points
of
risk
communication
reflecting
on
the
COVID-19
(
2019-nCoV
)
outbreak
in
Wuhan
,
China
.

We
provide
the
timeline
of
risk
communication
progress
in
Wuhan
and
use
a
message-centered
approach
to
identify
problems
that
it
entailed
.

It
was
found
that
the
delayed
decision
making
of
the
local
government
officials
and
the
limited
information
disclosure
should
be
mainly
responsible
for
the
ineffective
risk
communication
.

The
principles
for
effective
risk
communication
concerning
Wuhan
's
outbreak
management
were
also
discussed
.

The
whole
communication
process
is
suggested
to
integrate
the
accessibility
and
openness
of
risk
information
,
the
timing
and
frequency
of
communication
,
and
the
strategies
dealing
with
uncertainties
.

Based
on
these
principles
and
lessons
from
Wuhan
's
case
,
this
paper
employed
a
simplified
Government-Expert-Public
risk
communication
model
to
illustrate
a
collaborative
network
for
effective
risk
communication
.

Background
:
Concerns
have
been
raised
about
how
the
transmission
of
emerging
infectious
diseases
from
patients
to
healthcare
workers
(
HCWs
)
and
vice
versa
could
be
recognized
and
prevented
in
a
timely
manner
.

An
effective
strategy
to
block
transmission
of
pandemic
H1N1
(
2009
)
influenza
in
HCWs
is
important
.

Background
:
When
investigating
covariate
interactions
and
group
associations
with
standard
regression
analyses
,
the
relationship
between
the
response
variable
and
exposure
may
be
difficult
to
characterize
.

When
the
relationship
is
nonlinear
,
linear
modeling
techniques
do
not
capture
the
nonlinear
information
content
.

Statistical
learning
(
SL
)
techniques
with
kernels
are
capable
of
addressing
nonlinear
problems
without
making
parametric
assumptions
.

However
,
these
techniques
do
not
produce
findings
relevant
for
epidemiologic
interpretations
.

A
simulated
case-control
study
was
used
to
contrast
the
information
embedding
characteristics
and
separation
boundaries
produced
by
a
specific
SL
technique
with
logistic
regression
(
LR
)
modeling
representing
a
parametric
approach
.

The
SL
technique
was
comprised
of
a
kernel
mapping
in
combination
with
a
perceptron
neural
network
.

Because
the
LR
model
has
an
important
epidemiologic
interpretation
,
the
SL
method
was
modified
to
produce
the
analogous
interpretation
and
generate
odds
ratios
for
comparison
.

The
SL
approach
is
capable
of
generating
odds
ratios
for
main
effects
and
risk
factor
interactions
that
better
capture
nonlinear
relationships
between
exposure
variables
and
outcome
in
comparison
with
LR
.

Conclusions
:
The
integration
of
SL
methods
in
epidemiology
may
improve
both
the
understanding
and
interpretation
of
complex
exposure/disease
relationships
.

Exacerbation
of
macrophage-mediated
inflammation
contributes
to
pathogenesis
of
various
inflammatory
diseases
,
but
the
immunometabolic
programs
underlying
regulation
of
macrophage
activation
are
unclear
.

Here
we
show
that
V-set
immunoglobulin-domain-containing
4
(
VSIG4
)
,
a
B7
family-related
protein
that
is
expressed
by
resting
macrophages
,
inhibits
macrophage
activation
in
response
to
lipopolysaccharide
.

Vsig4
−/−
mice
are
susceptible
to
high-fat
diet-caused
obesity
and
murine
hepatitis
virus
strain-3
(
MHV-3
)
-induced
fulminant
hepatitis
due
to
excessive
macrophage-dependent
inflammation
.

VSIG4
activates
the
PI3K/
Akt-STAT3
pathway
,
leading
to
pyruvate
dehydrogenase
kinase-2
(
PDK2
)
upregulation
and
subsequent
phosphorylation
of
pyruvate
dehydrogenase
,
which
results
in
reduction
in
pyruvate/acetyl-CoA
conversion
,
mitochondrial
reactive
oxygen
species
secretion
,
and
macrophage
inhibition
.

Conversely
,
interruption
of
Vsig4
or
Pdk2
promotes
inflammation
.

Forced
expression
of
Vsig4
in
mice
ameliorates
MHV-3-induced
viral
fulminant
hepatitis
.

These
data
show
that
VSIG4
negatively
regulates
macrophage
activation
by
reprogramming
mitochondrial
pyruvate
metabolism
.

Porcine
epidemic
diarrhea
virus
(
PEDV
)
outbreaks
on
pig
farms
have
caused
significant
economic
loss
in
the
swine
industry
since
it
was
first
reported
in
Thailand
a
decade
ago
.

Anecdotal
evidence
suggests
that
PEDV
is
now
endemic
in
this
region
,
therefore
genome
information
of
circulating
PEDV
is
important
for
molecular
surveillance
and
evaluation
of
potential
benefits
of
field
vaccination
.

Here
,
we
characterized
PEDV
infection
on
commercial
Thai
swine
farms
by
screening
769
samples
of
feces
and
small
intestinal
contents
from
pigs
with
diarrhea
between
2011
and
2016
.

Using
reverse-transcription
polymerase
chain
reaction
targeting
the
spike
(
S
)
gene
,
153
PEDV-positive
samples
were
further
subjected
to
analysis
of
the
open
reading
frame
3
and
nucleocapsid
(
N
)
genes
.

Comparison
of
95
samples
in
which
nucleotide
sequencing
was
successfully
obtained
for
all
three
genes
revealed
evolutionary
diversity
among
the
Thai
PEDV
strains
.

Phylogenetic
analyses
suggest
that
although
some
Thai
strains
changed
little
from
years
past
,
others
resembled
more
closely
to
the
recent
strains
reported
in
China
.

Interestingly
,
eight
Thai
PEDV
strains
possessed
amino
acid
deletions
in
the
N
protein
.

The
PEDV
sequence
divergence
may
be
responsible
for
driving
periodic
outbreaks
and
continued
persistence
of
PEDV
on
commercial
swine
farms
.

Our
findings
provide
important
insight
into
regional
PEDV
strains
in
circulation
,
which
may
assist
future
inclusions
of
suitable
strains
for
future
PEDV
vaccines

Autoantibodies

may
play
an
important

in
the
early

and
evaluating

.

In

Ebola
Virus
Disease
(
EVD
)
is
one
of
the
most
lethal
transmissible
infections
,
characterized
by
a
high
fatality
rate
,
and
caused
by
a
member
of
the
Filoviridae
family

The
recent

Western
Africa
(
2013
)

the
worldwide
threat
represented
by
the

and
its
impact
on
global

and
the
economy
.

The
development
of
highly
needed
anti-Ebola
virus
antivirals
has
been
so
far
hampered
by
the
shortage
of
tools
to
study
their
life
cycle
in
vitro
,
allowing
to
screen
for
potential
active
compounds
outside
a
biosafety
level-4
(
BSL-4
)
containment
.

Importantly
,
the
development
of
surrogate
models
to
study
Ebola
virus
entry
in
a
BSL-2
setting
,
such
as
viral
pseudotypes
and
Ebola
virus-like
particles
,
tremendously
boosted
both
our
knowledge
of
the
viral
life
cycle
and
the
identification
of
promising
antiviral
compounds
interfering
with
viral
entry
.

In
this
context
,
the
combination
of
such
surrogate
systems
with
large-scale
small
molecule
compounds
and
haploid
genetic
screenings
,
as
well
as
rational
drug
design
and
drug
repurposing
approaches
will
prove
priceless
in
our
quest
for
the
development
of
a
treatment
for
EVD
.

Until
2014
,
EVD
was
considered
a
neglected
disease
,
causing
small
outbreaks
in
remote
African
villages
.

EBOV
research
was
focused
mainly
on
biology
aspects
of
viral
infection
or
preparedness
due
to
its
potential
use
as
bioweapon
,
and
was
limited
to
few
laboratories
equipped
with
biosafety
level-4
(
BSL-4
)
facilities
.

However
,
the
recent
large
outbreak
of
EVD
(
Western
Africa
,
2013-2016
)
characterized
by
28,616
cases
and
11,310
deaths
,
highlighted
the
worldwide
danger
of
this
disease
and
its
impact
on
global
public
health
and
economy
[

.

Thus
,
research
on
the
molecular
dissection
of
EBOV
life
cycle
received
a
strong
stimulus
and
financial
support
with
the
ultimate
goal
of
developing
effective
preventive
and
therapeutic
approaches
.

In
this
review
,
we
summarize
the
current
knowledge
of
a
specific
step
of
the
EBOV
life
cycle
,
the
entry
process
,
and
the
compounds
identified
so
far
capable
of
interfering
with
it
,
as
well
as
the
molecular
models
used
to
these
purposes
.

EBOV
is
an
enveloped
,
negative-stranded
RNA
virus
characterized
by
a
virion
of
≈80
nm
of
diameter
and
a
length
ranging
from
hundreds
of
nanometers
to
micrometers
.

The
genome
encodes
for
seven
structural
proteins
:
the
nucleoprotein
(
N
)
,
the
virion
protein
(
VP
)
24
,
VP35
,
VP30
,
VP40
,
the
glycoprotein
(
GP
)
,
and
the
RNA-dependent
RNA
polymerase
(
L
)
[
6
]
.

Inside
the
viral
particle
,
the
ribonucleoprotein
complex
consists
of
the
genomic
RNA
encapsidated
by
N
,
which
binds
to
VP35
,
VP30
and
L.
The
ribonucleoprotein
complex
interacts
with
the
envelope
,
containing
the
GP
,
through
the
matrix
protein
VP40
and
the
minor
matrix
protein
VP24
.

Viral
tropism
is
determined
by
GP
that
allows
the
interaction
with
target
cells
.

EBOV
productively
infects
a
broad
range
of
cell
types
such
as
monocytes
,
macrophages
,
dendritic
cells
,
endothelial
cells
,
fibroblasts
,
hepatocytes
,
and
adrenal
cortical
cells

Following
host
cell
attachment
(

,
the
virus
is
internalized
by
macropinocytosis

a
non-selective
process
of
engulfment
[

Binding
to
target
cells
is
mediated
by
different
attaching
factors
,
i.e.
,
C-type
lectins
,
T-cell
immunoglobulin
and
mucin

Furthermore
,
it
has
been
shown
that
binding
efficiency
is
related
to
the
activity
of
acid
Sphingomyelinase
(
aSMase
)
and
to
the
presence
of

.

On
the
viral
side
,
EBOV
attachment
and
entry
are
mediated
by
the
surface
glycoprotein
GP
,
a
class
I
fusion
protein
.

In
its
native
state
,
GP
is
a
triplet
of
heterodimers
,
each
composed
of
a
receptor
binding
subunit
(
GP1
)
and
a
fusion
subunit
(
GP2
)
.

The
GP1
and
GP2
subunits
originate
by
the
cleavage
within
the
Golgi
complex
of
a
single
precursor
peptide
,
and
remain
associated
through
a
disulfide
bond
and
non-covalent
interactions

cysteine
proteases
cathepsins

Subsequently
,
the
interaction
between
the
processed
GP1
and
the
late
endosomal/lysosomal
protein
Neimann-Pick
C1
(

leads
to
GP2-dependent

envelope
with
the
endosomal
limiting
membrane

Furthermore
,
it
has
been
shown
that
the
fusion
step
also
requires
the
Two-Pore
Channel
2
(
TPC2
)
activity
[

,
although
the
specific
role
of
TPC2
in
viral
entry
is
not
entirely
clear
yet
[

Finally
,
the
viral
nucleocapsid
is
released
into
the
cytoplasm
leading
to
transcription

replication
of
the
viral
genome
,
followed
by
assembly
and

of
the

After
the
infection
of
primary
cell
targets
,
the
viral
progeny
spreads
to
a

Macrophage-like
synoviocytes
and
fibroblast-like
synoviocytes
(
FLS

are
known
as
the
most
active
cells
of
rheumatoid
arthritis

RA
)
and
are
close
to
the
articular
cartilage

Macrophage-like
synoviocytes
and
FLS
expression
of
matrix
metalloproteinases
(
MMPs
)
and
their
interaction
has
aroused
great
interest
.

The
present
article
studied
the
expression
of
CD147
,
also
called
extracellular
matrix
metalloproteinase
inducer
,
on
monocytes/macrophages

FLS
from
RA
patients
and
its
potential
role
in
enhancing
MMPs
and
the
invasiveness
of
synoviocytes
.

Expression
of
CD147
on
FLS
derived
from
RA
patients
and
from
osteoarthritis
patients
,
and
expression
of
CD147
on
monocytes/macrophages
from
rheumatic
synovial
fluid
and
healthy
peripheral
blood
were
analyzed
by
flow

.

The
levels
of
CD147
,
MMP-2
and
MMP-9
mRNA
in
FLS
were
detected
by
RT-PCR

The
role
of
CD147
in
MMP

the

in

were
studied
by
the
co-culture
of

monocytes/macrophages
,
by
gel

The

that
the

higher
on

on

was
higher
on

RT-PCR

was
higher
in

.

A
significantly
elevated
secretion
and
activation
of

were
observed
in
RA
FLS

Invasion
assays

an
increased
number

the
co-cultured
RA

with
differentiated
THP-1

CD147
antagonistic
peptide
inhibited
the
MMP
production

the

Our
studies
demonstrated
that
the
CD147
overexpression
on
monocytes/macrophages

FLS
in
RA

be
one
of
the
important

Background
:
Cotton
blue
disease
(
CBD
)
,
an
important
global
cotton
crop
pathology
responsible
for
major
economic
losses
,
is
prevalent
in
the
major
cotton-producing
states
of
Brazil
.

Typical
CBD
symptoms
include
stunting
due
to
internodal
shortening
,
leaf
rolling
,
intense
green
foliage
,
and
yellowing
veins
.

Atypical
CBD
symptoms
,
including
reddish
and
withered
leaves
,
were
also
observed
in
Brazilian
cotton
fields
in
2007
.

Recently
,
a
Polerovirus
named
Cotton
leafroll
dwarf
virus
(
CLRDV
)
was
shown
to
be
associated
with
CBD
.

Results
:
To
understand
the
distribution
and
genetic
diversity
of
CLRDV
in
Brazil
,
we
analyzed
23
CBD-symptomatic
plants
from
susceptible
cotton
varieties
originating
from
five
of
the
six
most
important
cotton-growing
states
,
from
2004-2007
.

Here
,
we
report
on
CLRDV
diversity
in
plants
with
typical
or
atypical
CBD
symptoms
by
comparing
viral
coat
protein
,
RNA
polymerase
(
RdRp
)
,
and
intergenic
region
genomic
sequences
.

The
virus
had
a
widespread
distribution
with
a
low
genetic
diversity
;
however
,
three
divergent
isolates
were
associated
with
atypical
CBD
symptoms
.

These
divergent
isolates
had
a
CLRDV-related
coat
protein
but
a
distinct
RdRp
sequence
,
and
probably
arose
from
recombination
events
.

Based
on
the
taxonomic
rules
for
the
family
Luteoviridae
,
we
propose
that
these
three
isolates
represent
isolates
of
a
new
species
in
the
genus
Polerovirus
.

Sapovirus
is
a
genus
of
caliciviruses
that
are
known
to
cause
enteric
disease
in
humans
and
animals
.

There
is
considerable
genetic
diversity
among
the
sapoviruses
,
which
are
classified
into
different
genogroups
based
on
phylogenetic
analysis
of
the
full-length
capsid
protein
sequence
.

While
several
mammalian
species
,
including
humans
,
pigs
,
minks
,
and
dogs
,
have
been
identified
as
animal
hosts
for
sapoviruses
,
there
were
no
reports
of
sapoviruses
in
bats
in
spite
of
their
biological
diversity
.

In
this
report
,
we
present
the
results
of
a
targeted
surveillance
study
in
different
bat
species
in
Hong
Kong
.

Five
of
the
321
specimens
from
the
bat
species
,
Hipposideros
pomona
,
were
found
to
be
positive
for
sapoviruses
by
RT-PCR
.

Complete
or
nearly
full-length
genome
sequences
of
approximately
7.7
kb
in
length
were
obtained
for
three
strains
,
which
showed
similar
organization
of
the
genome
compared
to
other
sapoviruses
.

Interestingly
,
they
possess
many
genomic
features
atypical
of
most
sapoviruses
,
like
high
G+C
content
and
minimal
CpG
suppression
.

Phylogenetic
analysis
of
the
viral
proteins
suggested
that
the
bat
sapovirus
descended
from
an
ancestral
sapovirus
lineage
and
is
most
closely
related
to
the
porcine
sapoviruses
.

Codon
usage
analysis
showed
that
the
bat
sapovirus
genome
has
greater
codon
usage
bias
relative
to
other
sapovirus
genomes
.

In
summary
,
we
report
the
discovery
and
genomic
characterization
of
the
first
bat
calicivirus
,
which
appears
to
have
evolved
under
different
conditions
after
early
divergence
from
other
sapovirus
lineages
.

In
2012
,
a
novel

but
recently
renamed

,
was
identified
in
patients
who
suffered
severe
acute
respiratory

and
subsequent
renal

that
resulted
in

.

Ongoing

have
found
61
laboratory-confirmed
cases
of
infection
with
this

,
including
34

This

Phenomenon
of
unequal
use
of
synonymous
codons
in
Mycobacterium
tuberculosis
is
common
.

Codon
usage
bias
not
only
plays
an
important
regulatory
role
at
the
level
of
gene
expression
,
but
also
helps
in
improving
the
accuracy
and
efficiency
of
translation
.

Meanwhile
,
codon
usage
pattern
of
Mycobacterium
tuberculosis
genome
is
important
for
interpreting
evolutionary
characteristics
in
species
.

In
order
to
investigate
the
codon
usage
pattern
of
the
Mycobacterium
tuberculosis
genome
,
12
Mycobacterium
tuberculosis
genomes
from
different
area
are
downloaded
from
the
GeneBank
.

The
correlations
between
G
3
,
GC
12
,
whole
GC
content
,
codon
adaptation
index
,
codon
bias
index
,
and
so
on
of
Mycobacterium
tuberculosis
genomes
are
calculated
.

The
ENC-plot
,
relationship
between
A
3
/
(
A
3
+
T
3
)
and
G
3
/
(
G
3
+
C
3
)
,
GC
12
versus
GC
3
plot
,
and
the
RSCU
of
overall/separated
genomes
all
show
that
the
codon
usage
bias
exists
in
all
12
Mycobacterium
tuberculosis
genomes
.

Lastly
,
relationship
between
CBI
and
the
equalization
of
ENC
shows
a
strong
negative
correlation
between
them
.

The
relationship
between
protein
length
and
GC
content
(
GC
3
and
GC
12
)
shows
that
more
obvious
differences
in
the
GC
content
may
be
in
shorter
protein
.

These
results
show
that
codon
usage
bias
existing
in
the
Mycobacterium
tuberculosis
genomes
could
be
used
for
further
study
on
their
evolutionary
phenomenon
.

Feces
from
142
animals
were
collected
on
15
farms
in
the
region
of
Brittany
,
France
.

Each
sample
was
directly
collected
from
the
rectum
of
the
animal
and
identified
with
the
ear
tag
number
.

Animals
were
sampled
three
times
,
at
5
,
15
and
22
weeks
of
age
.

After
DNA
extraction
from
stool
samples
,
nested
PCR
was
performed
to
amplify
partial
18S-rDNA
and
60
kDa
glycoprotein
genes
of
Cryptosporidium
.

The
parasite
was
detected
on
all
farms
.

One
hundred
out
of
142
calves
(
70.4
%
)
were
found
to
be
parasitized
by
Cryptosporidium
.

Amplified
fragments
were
sequenced
for
Cryptosporidium
species
identification
and
revealed
the
presence
of
C.
parvum
(
43.8
%
)
,
C.
ryanae
(
28.5
%
)
,
and
C.
bovis
(
27
%
)
.

One
animal
was
infected
with
Cryptosporidium
ubiquitum
.

The
prevalence
of
these
species
was
related
to
the
age
of
the
animal
.

C.
parvum
caused
86.7
%
of
Cryptosporidium
infections
in
5-week-old
calves
but
only
1.7
%
in
15-week-old
animals
.

The
analysis
of
the
results
showed
that
animals
could
be
infected
successively
by
C.
parvum
,
C.
ryanae
,
and
C.
bovis
for
the

subtypes
of
which
74.5

were
represented
by

.

This
work
confirms
previous
studies
in
other

showing
that
zoonotic

Key
message
The
potent
anti-HIV
microbicide
griffithsin
was
expressed
to
high
levels
in
tobacco
chloroplasts
,
enabling
efficient
purification
from
both
fresh
and
dried
biomass
,
thus
providing
storable
material
for
inexpensive
production
and
scale-up
on

Abstract
The
global
HIV
epidemic
continues
to
grow
,
with
1.8
million
new
infections
occurring
per
year
.

In
the
absence
of
a
cure
and
an
AIDS
vaccine
,
there
is
a
pressing
need
to
prevent
new
infections
in
order
to
curb
the
disease
.

Topical
microbicides
that
block
viral
entry
into
human
cells
can
potentially
prevent
HIV
infection
.

The
antiviral
lectin
griffithsin
has
been
identified
as
a
highly
potent
inhibitor
of
HIV
entry
into
human
cells
.

Here
we
have
explored
the
possibility
to
use
transplastomic
plants
as
an
inexpensive
production
platform
for
griffithsin
.

We
show
that
griffithsin
accumulates
in
stably
transformed
tobacco
chloroplasts
to
up
to
5
%
of
the
total
soluble
protein
of
the
plant
.

Griffithsin
can
be
easily
purified
from
leaf
material
and
shows
similarly
high
virus
neutralization
activity
as
griffithsin
protein
recombinantly
expressed
in
bacteria
.

We
also
show
that
dried
tobacco
provides
a
storable
source
material
for
griffithsin
purification
,
thus
enabling
quick
scale-up
of
production
on
demand
.

Venereal
syphilis
is
a
multi-stage
,
sexually
transmitted
disease
caused
by
the
spirochetal
bacterium
Treponema
pallidum
(
Tp
)
.

Herein
we
describe
a
cohort
of
57
patients
(
age
18-68
years
)
with
secondary
syphilis
(
SS
)
identified
through
a
network
of
public
sector
primary
health
care
providers
in
Cali
,
Colombia
.

To
be
eligible
for
participation
,
study
subjects
were
required
to
have
cutaneous
lesions
consistent
with
SS
,
a
reactive
Rapid
Plasma
Reagin
test
(
RPR-titer

)
,
and
a
confirmatory
treponemal
test
(
Fluorescent
Treponemal
Antibody
Absorption
test-FTA-ABS
)
.

Most
subjects
enrolled
were
women
(
64.9
%
)
,
predominantly
Afro-Colombian
(
38.6
%
)
or
mestizo
(
56.1
%
)
,
and
all
were
of
low
socio-economic
status
.

Three
(
5.3
%
)
subjects
were
newly
diagnosed
with
HIV
infection
at
study
entry
.

The
duration
of
signs
and
symptoms
in
most
patients
(
53.6
%
)
was
less
than
30
days
;
however
,
some
patients
reported
being
symptomatic
for
several
months
(
range
5-240
days
)
.

The
typical
palmar
and
plantar
exanthem
of
SS
was
the
most
common
dermal
manifestation
(
63
%
)
,
followed
by
diffuse
hypo-or
hyperpigmented
macules
and
papules
on
the
trunk
,
abdomen
and
extremities
.

Three
patients
had
patchy
alopecia
.

Whole
blood
(
WB
)
samples
and
punch
biopsy
material
from
a
subset
of
SS
patients
were
assayed
for
the
presence
of
Tp
DNA
polymerase
I
gene
(
polA
)
target
by
real-time
qualitative
and
quantitative
PCR
methods
.

Twelve
(
46
%
)
of
the
26
WB
samples
studied
had
quantifiable
Tp
DNA
(
ranging
between
194.9
and
1954.2
Tp
polA
copies/ml
blood
)
and
seven
(
64
%
)
were
positive
when
WB
DNA
was
extracted
within
24
hours
of
collection
.

Tp
DNA
was
also
present
in
8/12
(
66
%
)
skin
biopsies
available
for
testing
.

Strain
typing
analysis
was
attempted
in
all
skin
and
WB
samples
with
detectable
Tp
DNA
.

Using
arp
repeat
size
analysis
and
tpr
RFLP
patterns
four
different
strain
types
were
identified
(
14d
,
16d
,
13d
and
22a
)
.

None
of
the
WB
samples
had
sufficient
DNA
for
typing
.

The
clinical
and
microbiologic
observations
presented
herein
,
together
with
recent
Cali
syphilis
seroprevalence
data
,
provide
additional
evidence
that
venereal
syphilis
is
highly
endemic
in
this
region
of
Colombia
,
thus
underscoring
the
need
for
health
care
providers
in
the
region
to
be
acutely
aware
of
the
clinical
manifestations
of
SS
.

This
study
also
provides
,
for
the
first
time
,
quantitative
evidence
that
a
significant
proportion
of
untreated
SS
patients
have
substantial
numbers
of
circulating
spirochetes
.

How
Tp
is
able
to
persist
in
the
blood
and
skin
of
SS
patients
,
despite
the
known
presence
of
circulating
treponemal
opsonizing
antibodies
and
the
robust
pro-inflammatory
cellular
immune
responses
characteristic
of
this
stage
of
the
disease
,
is
not
fully
understood
and
requires
further
study
.

The
liver
is
the
second
largest
organ
of
the
human
body
,
known
for
complex
functional
anatomy
involving
vascular
and
biliary
relationships
,
which
play
fundamental
roles
in
maintenance
and
regulation
of
the
body
energy
metabolism
.

Hence
,
disrupted
function
of
the
liver
has
been
found
to
be
related
to
an
extensive
range
of
complex
diseases
and
metabolic
disorders
.

Hepatomegaly
(
liver
enlargement
)
is
a
major
symptom
indicating
malfunctioning
of
the
liver
,
either
due
to
topical
disease
or
in
response
to
related
diseases
.

It
is
--
-

Interleukin-11
(
IL-11
)
,
a
well-known
anti-inflammatory
factor
,
provides
protection
from
intestinal
epithelium
damage
caused
by
physical
or
chemical
factors
.

However
,
little
is
known
of
the
role
of
IL-11
during
viral
infections
.

In
this
study
,
IL-11
expression
at
mRNA
and
protein
levels
were
found
to
be
high
in
Vero
cells
and
the
jejunum
of
piglets
during
porcine
epidemic
diarrhea
virus
(
PEDV
)
infection
,
while
IL-11
expression
was
found
to
be
positively
correlated
with
the
level
of
viral
infection
.

Pretreatment
with
recombinant
porcine
IL-11
(
pIL-11
)
was
found
to
suppress
PEDV
replication
in
Vero
E6
cells
,
while
IL-11
knockdown
promoted
viral
infection
.

Furthermore
,
pIL-11
was
found
to
inhibit
viral
infection
by
preventing
PEDV-mediated
apoptosis
of
cells
by
activating
the
IL-11/STAT3
signaling
pathway
.

Conversely
,
application
of
a
STAT3
phosphorylation
inhibitor
significantly
antagonized
the
anti-apoptosis
function
of
pIL-11
and
counteracted
its
inhibition
of
PEDV
.

Our
data
suggest
that
IL-11
is
a
newfound
PEDV-inducible
cytokine
,
and
its
production
enhances
the
anti-apoptosis
ability
of
epithelial
cells
against
PEDV
infection
.

The
potential
of
IL-11
to
be
used
as
a
novel
therapeutic
against
devastating
viral
diarrhea
in
piglets
deserves
more
attention
and
study
.

Background

TRQ
)
is
a
commonly
used
herbal
patent
medicine
for
treating
inflammatory
airway
diseases
in
view
of
its
outstanding
anti-inflammatory
properties
.

In
this
study
,
we
explored
the
signaling
pathways
involved
in
contributions
of
TRQ
to
LPS-induced
airway

in
rats

Conclusions
.

Results
of
the
current
research
indicate
that
TRQ
possesses
potent
exhibitory
effects
in
LPS-induced
airway
inflammation
by
,
at
least
partially
,
suppressing
the
MAPKs
and
NF-B
signaling
pathways
,
in
a
general
dose-dependent
manner
.

The
cytotoxicity
of
epitope-specific
CD8
+
T
cells
is
usually
measured
indirectly
through
IFNγ
production
.

Existing
assays
that
directly
measure
this
activity
are
limited
mainly
to
measurements
of
up
to
two
specificities
in
a
single
reaction
.

Here
,
we
develop
a
multiplex
cytotoxicity
assay
that
allows
direct
,
simultaneous
measurement
of
up
to
23
different
specificities
of
CD8
+
T
cells
in
a
single
reaction
.

This
can
greatly
reduce
the
amount
of
starting
clinical
materials
for
a
systematic
screening
of
CD8
+
T
cell
epitopes
.

In
addition
,
this
greatly
enhanced
capacity
enables
the
incorporation
of
irrelevant
epitopes
for
determining
the
non-specific
killing
activity
of
CD8
+
T
cells
,
thereby
allowing
to
measure
the
actual
epitope-specific
cytotoxicity
activities
.

This
technique
is
shown
to
be
useful
to
study
both
human
and
mouse
CD8
+
T
cells
.

Besides
,
our
results
from
human
PBMCs
and
three
independent
infectious
animal
models
(
MERS
,
influenza
and
malaria
)
further
reveal
that
IFNγ
expression
by
epitope-specific
CD8
+
T
cells
does
not
always
correlate
with
their
cell-killing
potential
,
highlighting
the
need
for
using
cytotoxicity
assays
in
specific
contexts
(
e.g.
,
evaluating
vaccine
candidates
)
.

Overall
,
our
approach
opens
up
new
possibilities
for
comprehensive
analyses
of
CD8
+
T
cell
cytotoxicity
in
a
practical
manner
.

The
inhibitory
receptor
programmed
death-1
(
PD-1
)
has
the
capacity
to
maintain
peripheral
tolerance
and
limit
immunopathological
damage
;
however
,
its
precise
role
in
fulminant
viral
hepatitis
(
FH
)
has
yet
to
be
described
.

Here
,
we
investigated
the
functional
mechanisms
of
PD-1
as
related
to
FH
pathogenesis
induced
by
the
murine
hepatitis
virus
strain-3
(
MHV-3
)
.

High
levels
of
PD-1-positive
CD4
+
,
CD8
+
T
cells
,
NK
cells
and
macrophages
were
observed
in
liver
,
spleen
,
lymph
node
and
thymus
tissues
following
MHV-3
infection
.

PD-1-deficient
mice
exhibited
significantly
higher
expression
of
the
effector
molecule
which
initiates
fibrinogen
deposition
,
fibrinogen-like
protein
2
(
FGL2
)
,
than
did
their
wild-type
(
WT
)
littermates
.

As
a
result
,
more
severe
tissue
damage
was
produced
and
mortality
rates
were
higher
.

Fluorescence
doublestaining
revealed
that
FGL2
and
PD-1
were
not
co-expressed
on
the
same
cells
,
while
quantitative
RT-PCR
demonstrated
that
higher
levels
of
IFN-c
and
TNF-a
mRNA
transcription
occurred
in
PD-1-deficient
mice
in
response
to
MHV-3
infection
.

Conversely
,
in
vivo
blockade
of
IFN-c
and
TNF-a
led
to
efficient
inhibition
of
FGL2
expression
,
greatly
attenuated
the
development
of
tissue
lesions
,
and
ultimately
reduced
mortality
.

Thus
,
the
up-regulation
of
FGL2
in
PD-1-deficient
mice
was
determined
to
be
mediated
by
IFN-c
and
TNF-a
.

Taken
together
,
our
results
suggest
that
PD-1
signaling
plays
an
essential
role
in
decreasing
the
immunopathological
damage
induced
by
MHV-3
and
that
manipulation
of
this
signal
might
be
a
useful
strategy
for
FH
immunotherapy
.

Infectious

)
is
a
highly
contagious
disease
of
the
respiratory

of
chickens
,
caused
by
infectious
bronchitis
virus
(
IBV
)
,
a
member
of
the
family
Coronaviridae
.

The
disease
is
common
throughout
the
world
where
chickens
are
produced
commercially
.

PCR
on
reverse
transcribed
RNA
is
a
potent
technique
for
the
detection
of
IBV
.

In
comparison
with
classical
detection
methods
,
PCR-based
techniques
are
both
sensitive
and
fast
.

Dozens
of
serotypes
and
genotypes
of
IBV
have
been
detected
,
and
many
more
will
surely
be
reported
in
future
.

This
research
was
conducted
to
identify
the
infectious
bronchitis
virus
with
group
specific
primers
of
avian
Coronaviruses
in
Zabol
,
southeast
of
Iran
.

Tracheal
swabs
were
collected
from
eleven
commercial
broiler
flocks
and
these
swabs
were
used
for
RNA
extraction
.

General
primers
included
XCE2+
and
XCE2-that
amplify
all
IBV
serotypes
were
used
.

Primers
MCE1+
,
BCE1+
and
DCE1+
was
used
to
amplifying
the
specific
nucleotide
sequence
of
Massachusetts
,
4/91
and
D274
serotypes
,
respectively
.

The
results
of
this
study
showed
that
36.36
%
of
the
sampled
flocks
were
positive
to
IBV
by
RT-PCR
.

Moreover
,
the
Massachusetts
was
the
identified
serotype
of
infectious
bronchitis
virus
.

The
results
provide
the
first
molecular
evidence
for
the
presence
of
infectious
bronchitis
virus
and
Massachusetts

in
Zabol
.

,
by

generation
of

.

Two
NmAbs
,
P4B-1
,
and
E10E-1-10
that
recognized
the
ectodomain
of
the
full-length
recombinant
PEDV
S
protein
and
exhibited
neutralizing
ability
against
the
PEDV-PT
virus
were
selected
.

Recombinant
truncated
S
proteins
were
used
to
identify
the
target
sequences
for
the
NmAbs
and
P4B-1
was
shown
to
recognize
the
C-terminus
of
CO-26K
equivalent
epitope
(
COE
)
at
amino
acids
(
a.a.
)

of
the
PEDV
S.
Interestingly
,
E10E-1-10
could
recognize
a
novel
neutralizing
epitope
at
a.a.
435-485
within
the

of
the
PEDV
S
protein
,
whose
importance
and
function
are
yet
to
be
determined
.

Moreover
,
both
NmAbs
could
not
bind
to
linearized
S
proteins
,
indicating
that
only
conformational
epitopes
are
recognized
.

This
data
could
improve
our
understanding
of
the
antigenic

particularly
in

.

The
first
outbreak
of
PED
was
recorded
in
the
European
and
Asian
swine
industries
in
the
early
1970s
and
then
spread
to
many
countries
3,4
.

In
2010
,
novel
and
highly
virulent
PEDV
strains
were
identified
in
China
,
which
later
spread
to
several
countries
1,5,6
.

These
new
variants
of
PEDV
have
caused
high
morbidity

in
neonatal
piglets
,
resulting
in
serious
economic
loss
to
the
swine
industry

.

Thus
,
there
is
an
urgent
need
for
in-depth
and
comprehensive
studies
on
the
antigenicity
and
immunogenicity
of
PEDVs
in
order
to
facilitate
disease
control
and

.

PEDV
is
a
single-stranded
RNA
virus
,
approximately
28
kb
in
size
,
which
belongs
to
the
genus
Alphacoronavirus
8
.

The
PEDV
genome
comprises
of
seven
open
reading
frames
(
ORFs
)
that
encode
for
non-structural
proteins
responsible
for
viral
genome
replication

,
as
well
as
four
structural

,
membrane
(

proteins
8,9
.

Among
the
structural
proteins
,
the
S
glycoprotein
plays
a
critical
role
in
host

,
virus-cell

Moreover
,
it
contains

that
make
it
a
suitable
target
for
vaccines
designed
to
neutralize
PEDVs
12-14
.

Several
neutralizing
epitopes
have
been
identified
on
the
S

of
the
PEDVs

.

The
proposed
S1

domain
has
a
sialic
acid
binding
domain

.

The
S1
B
domain
is
a
common
location
for
receptor
binding
in
coronaviruses
and
can
be
a
potential
neutralizing
target
for
the
new
PEDV
variant
capable
of
eliciting
the
production
of
cross-neutralizing
antibodies
against
different
PEDV
strains

.

Furthermore
,
several
linear
B-cell
epitopes
of
PEDV
overlapping
with
S1D
have
been
shown
to
neutralize
both
the
historic
strain
as
well
as
the
new
variant
PEDV
strains

.

Till
date
,
no
neutralizing
epitope
has
been
identified
in
the
S1

domain
of
the
historic

the
new

To
understand
the
antigenicity
of
PEDV
,
we
generated
a
panel
of
neutralizing
mAbs
(
NmAbs
)
by
immunizing
BALB/c
mice
with
inactivated
PEDV
viral
particles
.

The
neutralizing
epitopes
of
the
PEDV-PT
S
protein
,
recognized
by
two
of
the
NmAbs
,
were
characterized
using
a
series
of
C-terminal
truncated
recombinant
PEDV-PT
S
proteins
under
native
and
denaturing
conditions
.

This
approach
allows
us
to
identify
conformational
epitopes
of

Background
:
Protein
feature
extraction
plays
an
important
role
in
the
areas
of
similarity
analysis
of
protein
sequences
and
prediction
of
protein
structures
,
functions
and
interactions
.

The
feature
extraction
based
on
graphical
representation
is
one
of
the
most
effective
and
efficient
ways
.

However
,
most
existing
methods
suffer
limitations
from
their
method
design
.

Results
:
We
introduce
DCGR
,
a
novel
method
for
extracting
features
from
protein
sequences
based
on
the
chaos
game
representation
,
which
is
developed
by
constructing
CGR
curves
of
protein
sequences
according
to
physicochemical
properties
of
amino
acids
,
followed
by
converting
the
CGR
curves
into
multi-dimensional
feature
vectors
by
using
the
distributions
of
points
in
CGR
images
.

Tested
on
five
data
sets
,
DCGR
was
significantly
superior
to
the
state-of-the-art
feature
extraction
methods
.

The
DCGR
is
practically
powerful
for
extracting
effective
features
from
protein
sequences
,
and
therefore
important
in
similarity
analysis
of
protein
sequences
,
study
of
protein-protein
interactions
and
prediction
of
protein
functions

A
novel
vaccine
against
bovine
viral
diarrhea
(
BVD
)
induced
pathogenic
antibody
production
in
5-10
%
of
BVD-vaccinated
cows
.

Transfer
of
these
antibodies
via
colostrum
caused
Bovine
neonatal
pancytopenia
(
BNP
)
in
calves
,
with
a
lethality
rate
of
90
%
.

The
exact
immunological
mechanisms
behind
the
onset
of
BNP
are
not
fully
understood
to
date
.

To
gain
further
insight
into
these
mechanisms
,
we
analyzed
the
immune
proteome
from
alloreactive
antibody
producers
(
BNP
cows
)
and
non-responders
.

After
in
vitro
stimulation
of
peripheral
blood
derived
lymphocytes
(
PBL
)
,
we
detected
distinctly
deviant
expression
levels
of
several
master
regulators
of
immune
responses
in
BNP
cells
,
pointing
to
a
changed
immune
phenotype
with
severe
dysregulation
of
immune
response
in
BNP
cows
.

Interestingly
,
we
also
found
this
response
pattern
in
22
%
of
non-BVD-vaccinated
cows
,
indicating
a
genetic
predisposition
of
this
immune
deviant
(
ID
)
phenotype
in
cattle
.

We
additionally
analyzed
the
functional
correlation
of
the
ID
phenotype
with
10
health
parameters
and
6
diseases
in
a
retrospective
study
over
38
months
.

The
significantly
increased
prevalence
of
mastitis
among
ID
cows
emphasizes
the
clinical
relevance
of
this
deviant
immune
response
and
its
potential
impact
on
the
ability
to
fight
infections
.

In
this
work
,
we
study
the
evolution
of
the
susceptible
individuals
during
the
spread
of
an
epidemic
modeled
by
the
susceptible-infected-recovered
(
SIR
)
process
spreading
on
the
top
of
complex
networks
.

Using
an
edge-based
compartmental
approach
and
percolation
tools
,
we
find
that
a
time-dependent
quantity
Φ
S
(
t
)
,
namely
,
the
probability
that
a
given
neighbor
of
a
node
is
susceptible
at
time
t
,
is
the
control
parameter
of
a
node
void
percolation
process
involving
those
nodes
on
the
network
not-reached
by
the
disease
.

We
show
that
there
exists
a
critical
time
t
c
above
which
the
giant
susceptible
component
is
destroyed
.

As
a
consequence
,
in
order
to
preserve
a
macroscopic
connected
fraction
of
the
network
composed
by
healthy
individuals
which
guarantee
its
functionality
,
any
mitigation
strategy
should
be
implemented
before
this
critical
time
t
c
.

Our
theoretical
results
are
confirmed
by
extensive
simulations
of
the
SIR
process

Background
:
Vitamin
D
levels
are
alarmingly
low
(

)
in
65-70
%
of
North
American
children

An
increased
risk
of
viral
upper
respiratory
tract
infections
(
URTI
)
,
asthma-related
hospitalizations
and
use
of
anti-inflammatory
medication
have
all
been
linked
with
low
vitamin
D.
No
study
has
determined
whether
wintertime
vitamin

supplementation
can
reduce
the
risk
of
URTI
and
asthma
exacerbations
,
two
of
the
most
common
and

exacerbations
during
the
winter
in
preschool-aged
Canadian
children
;

to
assess
the
effect
of
'high

serum
levels
and
specific

URTI
.

Methods/Design
:
This
study
is
a
pragmatic
randomized
controlled
trial
.

Over
4
successive
winters
we
will
recruit
750
healthy
children
1-5
years
of
age
.

Participating
physicians
are
part
of
a
primary
healthcare
research
network
called

.

Children
will
be
randomized
to
the
'standard

'
or
'high

'
oral
supplemental
vitamin
D
for
a
minimum
of
4
months
(
200
children
per
group
)
.

Parents
will
obtain
a
nasal
swab
from
their
child
with
each
URTI
,
report
the
number
of
asthma
exacerbations
and
complete
symptom
checklists
.

Unscheduled
physician
visits
for
URTIs
and
asthma
exacerbations
will
be
recorded
.

By
May
,
a
blood
sample
will
be
drawn
to
determine
vitamin
D
serum
levels
.

The
primary
analysis
will
be
a
comparison
of
URTI
rate
between
study
groups
using
a
Poisson
regression
model
.

Secondary
analyses
will
compare
vitamin
D
serum
levels
,
asthma
exacerbations
and
the
frequency
of
specific
viral
agents
between
groups
.

Discussion
:
Identifying
whether
vitamin
D
supplementation
of
preschoolers
can
reduce
wintertime
viral
URTIs
and
asthma
exacerbations
and
what
dose
is
optimal
may
reduce
population
wide
morbidity
and
associated
health
care
and
societal
costs
.

This
information
will
assist
in
determining

recommendations
related
to
vitamin

Background-Our
group
has
used
deep
sequencing
to
identify
viral
RNA
signatures
in
human
brain
specimens
.

We
have
previously
used
this
method
to
detect
HSV1
,
GBV-C
,
and
measles
virus
sequence
in
brain
tissue
from
deceased
donors
.

Deep
sequencing
was
performed
on
brain
specimens
from
a
cohort
of
patients
who
died
with
progressive
forms
of
MS
,
revealing
evidence
of
increased
expression
of
some
human
endogenous
retrovirus
(
HERV
)
domains
.

Methods-Deep
sequencing
was
performed
on
RNA
extracted
from
12
progressive
MS
,
2
neuromyelitis
optica
(
MS/NMO

normal
control
,
and
7
other
neurologic
disease
(

)
control
frozen
brain
specimens
.

The
resulting
single-ended
50
bp
sequences
(
reads
)
were
compared
to
a
non
redundant
viral
database
representing
(
NRVDB
)
all
1.2
M
viral
records
in
GenBank
.

A
retroviral
gene
catalog
(
RVGC
)
was
prepared
by
identifying
human
genetic
loci
(
GRCh37.p13
)
homologous
to
domains
contained
in
the
Gypsy
2.0
retro
element
database
.

Reads
were
aligned
to
the
RVGC
and
human
transcriptome
with
Bowtie2
.

The
resulting
viral
hit
rates
(
VHRs
)
were
normalized
by
the
number
of
high
quality
reads
.

The
expression
of
human
genes
,
including
HERVs
,
was
determined
using
Cufflinks
.

Comparisons
between
the
groups
were
performed
using
the
false
discovery
rate
.

Results-Fifty
to
131
million
high
quality
reads
per
specimen
were
obtained
.

Comparison
of
the
reads
to
the
NRVDB
suggested
that
the
demyelination
and
OND
specimens
had
higher
VHRs
against
some
retroviral
sequences
compared
with
the
controls
.

This
was
confirmed
by
retroviral
domain
averaging
.

Gene
expression
analysis
showed
differential
expression
among
some
HERV
sequences
.

Single
read
mapping
revealed
one
envelope
and
one
reverse
transcriptase
sequence
record
that
were
significantly
enriched
among
the
demyelination
samples
compared
to
the
normal
controls
.

Less
restrictive

read
mapping
showed
that
2
integrase
,
2
core
,
2
envelope
,
and
3
KRAB
sequences
that
were
overexpressed
in
the
demyelination
group
.

This
is
an
open-Conclusions-These
data
demonstrate
that
some
endogenous
retroviral
sequences
are
significantly
overexpressed
in
these
demyelination
brain
tissue
specimens
,
but
the
magnitude
of
this
overexpression
is
small
.

This
is
consistent
with
the
concept
of
HERV
activation
as
a
part
of
the
innate

neutrophil
signaling
,
the
effects
on
neutrophil
adhesion
to
human
umbilical
vein
endothelial
cells
of
a
set
of
CD66
mAbs
was
tested
following
desensitization
to
stimulation
by
various
combinations
of
these
mAbs
.

Addition
of
a
CD66
mAb
in
the
absence
of
calcium
results
in
desensitization
of
neutrophils
to
stimulation
by
that
CD66
mAb
.

The
current
data
show
that
desensitization
of
neutrophils
to
any
two
CEACAMs
results
in
selective
desensitization
to
those
two
CEACAMs
,
while
the
cells
remain
responsive
to
the
other
two
neutrophil
CEACAMs
.

In
addition
,
cells
desensitized
to
CEACAM-3
,
-6
,
and
-8
were
still
responsive
to
stimulation
of
CEACAM1
by
CD66a
mAbs
.

In
contrast
,
desensitization
of
cells
to
CEACAM1
and
any
two
of
the
other
CEACAMs
left
the
cells
unresponsive
to
all
CD66
mAbs
.

Cells
desensitized
to
any
combination
of
CEACAMs
remained
responsive
to
the
unrelated
control
protein
CD63
.

Thus
,
while
there
is
significant
independence
of
the
four
neutrophil
CEACAMs
in
signaling
,
CEACAM1
appears
to
play
a
unique
role
among
the
neutrophil
CEACAMs
.

A
model
in
which
CEACAMs
dimerize
to
form
signaling
complexes
could
accommodate
the
observations
.

Similar
interactions
may
occur
in
other
cells
expressing
CEACAMs
.

Host
cell
membrane
rearrangements
induced
by
the
hepatitis
C
virus
(
HCV
)
have
been
exclusively
studied
in
vitro
.

These
studies
have
shown
that
HCV
induces
double-membrane
vesicles
(
DMVs
)
,
which
probably
serve
to
separate
replication
sites
from
the
cytoplasmic
sensors
of
the
innate
immune
response
.

We
report
for
the
first
time
the
observation
of
HCV-induced
membrane
rearrangements
in
liver
biopsy
specimens
from
patients
chronically
infected
with
HCV
.

Unlike
observations
performed
in
vitro
,
the
membranous
web
detected
in
liver
tissue
seems
essentially
made
of
clusters
of
single-membrane
vesicles
derived
from
the
endoplasmic
reticulum
and
close
to
lipid
droplets
.

This
suggests
that
the
DMVs
could
be
a
hallmark
of
laboratory-adapted
HCV
strains
,
possibly
due
to
their
ability
to
achieve
a
high
level
of
replication
.

Alternatively
,
the
concealment
of
viral
RNA
in
DMVs
may
be
part
of
innate
immune
response
mechanisms
particularly
developed
in
hepatoma
cell
lines
cultured
in
vitro
.

In
any
case
,
this
constitutes
the
first
report
showing
the
differences
in
the
membranous
web
established
by
HCV
in
vitro
and
in
vivo
.

Ubl2
domain
from
MERS
PLpro
has
no
effect
on
its
ability
to
process
the
viral
polyprotein
or
act
as
an
interferon
antagonist
,
which
involves
deubiquitinating
and
deISGylating
cellular
proteins
.

Here
,
we
test
the
hypothesis
that
the
Ubl2
domain
is
not
required
for
the
catalytic
function
of
MERS
PLpro
in
vitro
.

The
X-ray
structure
of
MERS
PLpro-∆Ubl2
was
determined
to
1.9
Å
and
compared
to
PLpro
containing
the
N-terminal
Ubl2
domain
.

While
the
structures
were
nearly
identical
,
the
PLpro-∆Ubl2
enzyme
revealed
the
intact
structure
of
the
substrate-binding
loop
.

Moreover
,
PLpro-∆Ubl2
catalysis
against
different
substrates
and
a
purported
inhibitor
revealed
no
differences
in
catalytic
efficiency
,
substrate
specificity
,
and
inhibition
.

Further
,
no
changes
in
thermal
stability
were
observed
between
enzymes
.

We
conclude
that
the
catalytic
core
of
MERS
PLpro
,
i.e
.

without
the
Ubl2
domain
,
is
sufficient
for
catalysis
and
stability
in
vitro
with
utility
to
evaluate
potential
inhibitors
as
a
platform
for
structure-based
drug
design
.

Coronaviruses
(
CoVs
)
are
enveloped
,
positive
sense
,
single-stranded
RNA
viruses
that
cause
mild
to
severe
upper
respiratory
tract
infections
in
humans
.

Approximately
10
years
after
emergence
of
the
severe
acute
respiratory
syndrome
coronavirus
(
SARS-CoV
)
in
2002/2003
,
Middle
East
respiratory
syndrome
coronavirus
(
MERS-CoV
)
emerged
and
has
been
identified
so
far
in
26
countries
with
a
case-fatality
rate
over
30
%
1,2
.

Although
these
CoVs
are
well-recognized
global
pathogens
,
there
are
no
antiviral
interventions
available
.

Thus
,
a
better
understanding
of
the
molecular
mechanisms
that
facilitate
viral
pathogenesis
and
replication
may
permit
the
design
of
targeted
therapeutics
against
CoVs
.

MERS-CoV
is
classified
in
the
sub-lineage
C
genus
Betacoronavirus
with
a
conserved
genomic
size
of
~30
kb
among
other
CoVs
2
.

The
first
22
kilobases
located
at
the
5′
-end
of
the
RNA
genome
is
encoded
in
two
open
reading
frames
(
ORF1a/ORF1b
)
that
are
translated
by
host
ribosomes
to
generate
two
respective
viral
polyproteins
(
pp1a
&
pp1ab
)
.

Pp1a
and
pp1ab
are
processed
by
two
virus-encoded
cysteine
proteases
,
termed
the
papain-like
protease
(
PLpro
)
and
the
3C-like
protease
(
3CLpro
)
.

Together
,
these
two
proteases
cleave
the
polyproteins
to
produce
16
nonstructural
proteins
(
nsps
)
,
which
are
essential
for
the
formation
of
the
replicase
complex
and
hence
RNA
replication
.

This
study
focuses
on
the
multifunctional
and
putative
drug
target
,
PLpro
,
located
in

Current
uses
of
culture-independent
tools
in
previous
studies
have
shown
a
significant
relationship
between
microbiota
and
asthma
.

Although
these
studies
are
relatively
new
,
there
is
also
evidence
of
the
possibility
of
new
therapeutic
strategies
for
the
treatment
or
prevention
of
asthma
.

This
article
retrospectively
examines
the
possible
association
between
microorganisms
and
asthma
.

Data
on
all
patients
with
different
types
of
asthma
were
collected
from
hospital
charts
from
the
within
the
study
period
of
2011
to
2012
.

The
tracheal
secretions
of
asthmatics
obtained
by
bronchoalveolar
lavage
,
bronchial
aspirates
through
flexible
bronchoscopy
,
and
directly
in
sputum
were
examined
microbiologically
for
microorganisms
.

Thirty-one

10.47

95
%
CI
,
6.98-13.96
)
of
a
total
of
296
patients
were
found
to
have
asthma
microorganisms
in
their
airways
.

We
could
not
establish
a
causal
relationship
between
microorganisms
and
asthma
based
on
the
results
of
our
study
(
P

)
.

Additionally
,
acute
respiratory
infections
did
not
affect
the
microbiological
colonization
in
asthmatics
'
airways
(
P
¼

)
.

We
were
unable
to
find
a
direct
association
between
asthma
and
the
microbiome
based
on
existing
diagnostic
techniques

Background
:
In
China
,
large-scale
outbreaks
of
severe
diarrhea
caused
by
viruses
have
occurred
in
pigs
since
late
2010
.

To
investigate
the
prevalence
and
genetic
evolution
of
diarrhea-associated
viruses
responsible
for
the
outbreaks
,
a
total
of
2987
field
diarrheal
samples
collected
from
168
pig
farms
in
five
provinces
in
Southern
China
during
2012-2018
were
tested
.

Results
:
Porcine
epidemic
diarrhea
virus
(
PEDV
)
was
most
frequently
detected
virus
with
prevalence
rates
between
50.21
and
62.10
%
in
samples
,
and
96.43
%
(
162/168
)
in
premises
,
respectively
.

Porcine
deltacoronavirus
(
PDCoV
)
was
the
second
prevalent
virus
with
prevalence
rates
ranging
from
19.62
to
29.19
%
in
samples
,
and
70.24
%
(
118/168
)
in
premises
,
respectively
.

Both
transmissible
gastroenteritis
virus
(
TGEV
)
and
porcine
rotavirus
(
PoRV
)
were
detected
at
low
prevalence
rates
of
<
3
%
in
samples
and
10.12
%
in
premises
.

In
this
study
,
we
identified
a
newly
emerged
swine
acute
diarrhea
syndrome
coronavirus
(
SADS-CoV
)
in
diarrheal
samples
of
piglets
from
Fujian
province
in
Southern
China
,
and
the
prevalence
rate
of
SADS-CoV
was
10.29
%
(
7/68
)
.

Co-infections
of
these
diarrhea-associated
viruses
were
common
.

The
most
frequent
co-infection
was
PEDV
with
PDCoV
,
with
an
average
detection
rate
of
12.72
%
(
380/2987
,
ranging
from
8.26-17.33
%
)
.

Phylogenetic
analysis
revealed
that
PEDVs
circulating
in
Southern
China
during
the
last
7
years
were
clustered
with
the
variant
strains
of
PEDV
in
genotype
IIa
.

The
most
frequent
mutations
were
present
in
the
collagenase
equivalent
(
COE
)
and
epitope
regions
of
the
spike
gene
of
the
PEDVs
currently
circulating
in
the
field
.

Genetic
relationships
of
PDCoVs
were
closely
related
with
Chinese
strains
,
other
than
those
present
in
the
USA
,
South
Korea
,
Thailand
and
Lao
's
public
.

Conclusions
:
The
findings
of
this
study
indicated
that
variant
PEDV
,
PDCoV
,
and
SADS-CoV
were
leading
etiologic
agents
of
porcine
diarrhea
,
and
either
mono-infections
or
co-infections
of
pathogenic
enteric
CoVs
were
common
in
pigs
in
Southern
China
during
2012-2018
.

Thus
,
significant
attention
should
be
paid
in
order
to
effectively
prevent
and
control
porcine
viral
diarrhea
.

Herpesviruses
constitute
a
family
of
large
DNA
viruses
widely
spread
in
vertebrates
and
causing
a
variety
of
different
diseases
.

They
possess
dsDNA
genomes
ranging
from
120
to
240
kbp
encoding
between
70
to
170
open
reading
frames
.

We
previously
reported
the
protein
interaction
networks
of
two
herpesviruses
,
varicella-zoster
virus
(
VZV
)
and
Kaposi
's
sarcoma-associated
herpesvirus
(
KSHV
)
.

In
this
study
,
we
systematically
tested
three
additional
herpesvirus
species
,
herpes
simplex
virus
1
(
HSV-1
)
,
murine
cytomegalovirus
and
Epstein-Barr
virus
,
for
protein
interactions
in
order
to
be
able
to
perform
a
comparative
analysis
of
all
three
herpesvirus
subfamilies
.

We
identified
735
interactions
by
genome-wide
yeasttwo-hybrid
screens
(
Y2H
)
,
and
,
together
with
the
interactomes
of
VZV
and
KSHV
,
included
a
total
of
1,007
intraviral
protein
interactions
in
the
analysis
.

Whereas
a
large
number
of
interactions
have
not
been
reported
previously
,
we
were
able
to
identify
a
core
set
of
highly
conserved
protein
interactions
,
like
the
interaction
between
HSV-1
UL33
with
the
nuclear
egress
proteins
UL31/UL34
.

Interactions
were
conserved
between
orthologous
proteins
despite
generally
low
sequence
similarity
,
suggesting
that
function
may
be
more
conserved
than
sequence
.

By
combining
interactomes
of
different
species
we
were
able
to
systematically
address
the
low
coverage
of
the
Y2H
system
and
to
extract
biologically
relevant
interactions
which
were
not
evident
from
single
species
.

By
using
the
microscopic
Markov-chain
approximation
approach
,
we
investigate
the
epidemic
spreading
and
the
responsive
immunization
in
social
networks
.

It
is
assumed
that
individual
vaccination
behavior
depends
on
the
local
information
of
an
epidemic
.

Our
results
suggest
that
the
responsive
immunization
has
negligible
impact
on
the
epidemic
threshold
and
the
critical
value
of
initial
epidemic
outbreak
,
but
it
can
effectively
inhibit
the
outbreak
of
epidemic
.

We
also
analyze
the
influence
of
the
intervention
on
the
disease
dynamics
,
where
the
vaccination
is
available
only
to
those
individuals
whose
number
of
neighbors
is
greater
than
a
certain
value
.

Simulation
analysis
implies
that
the
intervention
strategy
can
effectively
reduce
the
vaccine
use
under
the
epidemic
control

It
is
well
known
that
the
vaccination
is
very
helpful
in
controlling
vaccine
preventable
disease
.

When
the
voluntary
vaccination
can
eradicate
the
epidemic
transmission
eventually
,
two
relevant
problems
are
presented
:
(
i
)
whether
it
is
able
to
decrease
the
possibility
of
epidemic
outbreak
?

(
ii
)
how
the
vaccine
should
be
used
at
minimum
to
yield
better
result
?

In
this
work
,
we
attempt
to
solve
them
to
some
extent
.

By
introducing
the
responsive
immunization
based
on
the
local
information
,
we
study
the
impact
of
the
voluntary
vaccination
on
the
epidemic
threshold
.

Theoretical
analysis
and
simulation
shows
that
the
responsive
immunization
can
not
significantly
affect
the
condition
of
epidemic
.

We
further
analyze
the
intervention
strategy
based
on
the
targeted
immunization
and
find
that
it
can
effectively
reduce
the
vaccine
use
.

These
results
may
allow
to
gain
new
insight
into
the
role
of
the
voluntary
vaccination
in
the
epidemic
control
.

Background
:
Many
probiotic
bacteria
have
been
described
as
promising
tools
for
the
treatment
and
prevention
of
inflammatory
bowel
diseases
(
IBDs
)
.

Most
of
these
bacteria
are
lactic
acid
bacteria
,
which
are
part
of
the
healthy
human
microbiota
.

However
,
little
is
known
about
the
effects
of
transient
bacteria
present
in
normal
diets
,
including
Lactococcus
lactis
.

Methods
:
In
the
present
study
,
we
analysed
the
immunomodulatory
effects
of
three
L.
lactis
strains
in
vitro
using
intestinal
epithelial
cells
.

L.
lactis
NCDO
2118
was
administered
for
4
days
to
C57BL/6
mice
during
the
remission
period
of
colitis
induced
by
dextran
sodium
sulphate
(
DSS
)
.

Results
:
Only
one
strain
,
L.
lactis
NCDO
2118
,
was
able
to
reduce
IL-1β-induced
IL-8
secretion
in
Caco-2
cells
,
suggesting
a
potential
anti-inflammatory
effect
.

Oral
treatment
using
L.
lactis
NCDO
2118
resulted
in
a
milder
form
of
recurrent
colitis
than
that
observed
in
control
diseased
mice
.

This
protective
effect
was
not
attributable
to
changes
in
secretory
IgA
(
sIgA
)
;
however
,
NCDO
2118
administration
was
associated
with
an
early
increase
in
IL-6
production
and
sustained
IL-10
production
in
colonic
tissue
.

Mice
fed
L.
lactis
NCDO
2118
had
an
increased
number
of
regulatory
CD4
+
T
cells
(
Tregs
)
bearing
surface
TGF-β
in
its
latent
form
(
Latency-associated
peptide-LAP
)
in
the
mesenteric
lymph
nodes
and
spleen
.

Conclusions
:
Here
,
we
identified
a
new
probiotic
strain
with
a
potential
role
in
the
treatment
of
IBD
,
and
we
elucidated
some
of
the
mechanisms
underlying
its
anti-inflammatory
effect
.

There
was
a
pandemic
of
influenza
A
(
H1N1
)
in
2009
;
in
Korea
,
there
was
also
an
H1N1
epidemic
in
2016
.

We
aim
to
investigate
whether
survival
had
improved
in
the
setting
of
recent
advances
in
intensive
care
unit
(
ICU
)
management
.

We
conducted
a
retrospective
analysis
of
acute
respiratory
failure
patients
with
H1N1
influenza
pneumonia
in
2016
and
2009
respectively
at
two
tertiary
referral
hospitals
in
Korea
.

A
total
of
28
patients
were
treated
in
2016
,
and
34
in
2009
.

There
was
no
significant
difference
in
SOFA
scores
on
ICU
admission
day
.

In-hospital
mortality
was
significantly
lower
in
patients
of
2016
compared
to
those
of
2009
(
18
%
vs.
44
%
P
=
0.028
)
.

By
multivariable
analyses
,
the
treatment
year
2016
was
associated
with
a
greater
likelihood
of
survival
.

Compared
to
the
patients
treated
in
2009
,
those
treated
in
2016
were
one
seventh
as
likely
to
die
after
adjusting
for
other
clinical
variables

Many
RNA
viruses
arise
from
animal
reservoirs
,
namely
bats
,
rodents
and
insectivores
but
mechanisms
of
virus
maintenance
and
transmission
still
need
to
be
addressed
.

The
bicolored
white-toothed
shrew
(
Crocidura
leucodon
)
has
recently
been
identified
as
reservoir
of
the
neurotropic
Borna
disease
virus
1
(
BoDV-1
)
.

Six
out
of
eleven
wild
living
bicoloured
white-toothed
shrews
were
trapped
and
revealed
to
be
naturally
infected
with
BoDV-1
.

All
shrews
were
monitored
in
captivity
in
a
long-term
study
over
a
time
period
up
to
600
days
that
differed
between
the
individual
shrews
.

Interestingly
,
all
six
animals
showed
an
asymptomatic
course
of
infection
despite
virus
shedding
via
various
routes
indicating
a
highly
adapted
host-pathogen
interaction
.

Infectious
virus
and
viral
RNA
were
demonstrated
in
saliva
,
urine
,
skin
swabs
,
lacrimal
fluid
and
faeces
,
both
during
the
first
8
weeks
of
the
investigation
period
and
for
long
time
shedding
after
more
than
250
days
in
captivity
.

The
various
ways
of
shedding
ensure
successful
virus
maintenance
in
the
reservoir
population
but
also
transmission
to
accidental
hosts
such
as
horses
and
sheep
.

Naturally
BoDV-1infected
living
shrews
serve
as
excellent
tool
to
unravel
host
and
pathogen
factors
responsible
for
persistent
viral
co-existence
in
reservoir
species
while
maintaining
their
physiological
integrity
despite
high
viral
load
in
many
organ
systems
.

We
present
an
optimized
probe
design
for
copy
number
variation
(
CNV
)
and
SNP
genotyping
in
the
Plasmodium
falciparum
genome
.

We
demonstrate
that
variable
length
and
isothermal
probes
are
superior
to
static
length
probes
.

We
show
that
sample
preparation
and
hybridization
conditions
mitigate
the
effects
of
host
DNA
contamination
in
field
samples
.

The
microarray
and
workflow
presented
can
be
used
to
identify
CNVs
and
SNPs
with
95
%
accuracy
in
a
single
hybridization
,
in
field
samples
containing
up
to
92
%
human
DNA
contamination
.

Background
:
Nuclear
factor
kappa
B
(
NF-κB
)
is
a
key
transcription
factor
that
plays
a
crucial
role
in
host
survival
during
infection
by
pathogens
.

Therefore
,
it
has
been
a
priority
of
many
pathogens
to
manipulate
the
cellular
NF-κB
activity
in
order
to
create
a
favorable
environment
for
their
survival
inside
the
host
.

Results
:
We
observed
that
heterologous
expression
of
the
open
reading
frame
2
(
ORF2
)
protein
in
human
hepatoma
cells
led
to
stabilization
of
the
cellular
I
kappa
B
alpha
(
IκBα
)
pool
,
with
a
concomitant
reduction
in
the
nuclear
localization
of
the
p65
subunit
of
NF-κB
and
inhibition
of
NF-κB
activity
.

Although
basal
or
TPA
induced
phosphorylation
of
IκBα
was
not
altered
,
its
ubiquitination
was
markedly
reduced
in
ORF2
expressing
cells
.

Further
analysis
revealed
that
ORF2
protein
could
directly
associate
with
the
F-box
protein
,
beta
transducin
repeat
containing
protein
(
βTRCP
)
and
ORF2
over
expression
resulted
in
reduced
association
of
IκBα
with
the
SKP1
and
CUL1
components
of
the
SCF
βTRCP
complex
.

Chromatin
immunoprecipitation
(
ChIP
)
assay
of
the
proximal
promoter
regions
of
MHC-I
heavy
chain
and
IL-8
genes
using
p65
antibody
and
LPS
stimulated
ORF2
expressing
cell
extract
revealed
decreased
association
of
p65
with
the
above
regions
,
indicating
that
ORF2
inhibited
p65
binding
at
endogenous
promoters
.

Conclusions
:
In
this
report
we
suggest
a
mechanism
by
which
ORF2
protein
of
HEV
may
inhibit
host
cell
NF-κB
activity
during
the
course
of
a
viral
infection
.

Background
:
Influenza
infection
causes
respiratory
disease
that
can
lead
to
death
.

The
complex
interplay
between
virus-encoded
and
host-specific
pathogenicity
regulatorsand
the
relative
contributions
of
each
toward
viral
pathogenicityis
not
well-understood
.

Results
:
By
analyzing
a
collection
of
lung
samples
from
mice
infected
by
A/Vietnam/1203/2004
(
H5N1
;
VN1203
)
,
we
characterized
a
signature
of
transcripts
and
proteins
associated
with
the
kinetics
of
the
host
response
.

Using
a
new
geometrical
representation
method
and
two
criteria
,
we
show
that
inoculation
concentrations
and
four
specific
mutations
in
VN1203
mainly
impact
the
magnitude
and
velocity
of
the
host
response
kinetics
,
rather
than
specific
sets
of
up-and
down-regulated
genes
.

We
observed
analogous
kinetic
effects
using
lung
samples
from
mice
infected
with
A/California/04/2009
(
H1N1
)
,
and
we
show
that
these
effects
correlate
with
morbidity
and
viral
titer
.

We
have
demonstrated
the
importance
of
the
kinetics
of
the
host
response
to
H5N1
pathogenesis
and
its
relationship
with
clinical
disease
severity
and
virus
replication
.

These
kinetic
properties
imply
that
time-matched
comparisons
of
'omics
profiles
to
viral
infections
give
limited
views
to
differentiate
host-responses
.

Moreover
,
these
results
demonstrate
that
a
fast
activation
of
the
host-response
at
the
earliest
time
points
post-infection
is
critical
for
protective
mechanisms
against
fast
replicating
viruses
.

CD8
+
T
cells
provide
broad
immunity
to
viruses
,
because
they
are
able
to
recognize
all
types
of
viral
proteins
.

Therefore
,
the
development
of
vaccines
capable
of
inducing
long-lived
memory
CD8
+
T
cells
is
desired
to
prevent
diseases
,
especially
those
for
which
no
vaccines
currently
exist
.

However
,
in
designing
CD8
+
T
cell
vaccines
,
the
role
of
CD4
+
T
cells
in
the
induction
and
maintenance
of
memory
CD8
+
T
cells
remains
uncertain
.

In
the
present
study
,
the
necessity
or
not
of
CD4
+
T
cells
in
the
induction
and
maintenance
of
memory
CD8
+
T
cells
was
investigated
in
mice
immunized
with
liposome-coupled
CTL
epitope
peptides
.

When
OVA-derived
CTL
epitope
peptides
were
chemically
coupled
to
the
surfaces
of
liposomes
and
inoculated
into
mice
,
both
primary
and
secondary
CTL
responses
were
successfully
induced
.

The
results
were
further
confirmed
in
CD4
+
T
cell-eliminated
mice
,
suggesting
that
CD4
+
T
cells
were
not
required
for
the
generation
of
memory
CD8
+
T
cells
in
the
case
of
immunization
with
liposome-coupled
peptides
.

Thus
,
surface-linked
liposomal
antigens
,
capable
of
inducing
long-lived
memory
CD8
+
T
cells
without
the
contribution
of
CD4
+
T
cells
,
might
be
applicable
for
the
development
of
vaccines
to
prevent
viral
infection
,
especially
for
those
viruses
that
evade
humoral
immunity
by
varying
their
surface
proteins
,
such
as
influenza
viruses
,
HIV
,
HCV
,
SARS
coronaviruses
,
and
Ebola
viruses
.

Background
:
HIV/AIDS
is
one
of
the
most
stigmatized
medical
conditions
across
the
world
.

Self-stigma
is
prevalent
among
people
living
with
HIV
(
PLHIV
)
and
a
major
obstacle
to
HIV
prevention
and
care
.

Objective
:
This
study
aimed
to
describe
the
experiences
of
stigmatization
and
explore
the
possible
factors
that
might
be
associated
with
stigmatization
among
PLHIV
in
Hong
Kong
.

Design
:
Qualitative
in-depth
interviews
were
conducted
.

Setting
and
participants
:
15
PLHIV
were
recruited
from
two
local
non-governmental
organizations
on

prevention
.

Participants
were
interviewed
about
their
views
and
feelings
towards
oneself
as
a
PLHIV
and
contributing
factors
,
experiences
of
discriminations
,
stigmatizing
behaviours
,
issues
about
disclosure
,
social
relationships
and
potential
impact
of
HIV
.

Thematic
analyses
revealed
three
levels
of
factors
which
might
be
associated
with
stigmatization
:
(
i
)
intrapersonal
level
(
misconceptions
about

)
and
(
iii

.

Findings
provide
important
insights

vaccines
can
not
provide
complete
protection
against
HP-PRRSV
due
to
genetic
variation
.

Development
of
more
effective
vaccines
against
the
emerging
HP-PRRSV
is
urgently
required
.

In
our
previous
studies
,
two
formulations
of
DNA
vaccines
(
pcDNA3.1-PoIFN-λ1-SynORF5
and
BPEI/PLGA-SynORF5
)
based
on
the
HP-PRRSV
were
constructed
and
shown
to
induce
enhanced
humoral
and
cellular
immune
responses
in
mice
.

The
objective
of
this
study
was
to
evaluate
the
immune
response
induced
by
these
novel
formulations
in
piglets
.

PcDNA3.1-PoIFN-λ1-SynORF5
and
BPEI/
PLGA-SynORF5
vaccines
induced
significantly
enhanced
GP5-specific
antibody
and
PRRSV-specific
neutralizing
antibody
in
pigs
compared
with
the
pcDNA3.1-SynORF5
parental
construct
.

Though
IFN-γ
levels
and
lymphocyte
proliferation
responses
induced
by
the
two
DNA
vaccine
formulations
were
comparable
to
that
induced
by
the
pcDNA3.1-SynORF5
construct
,
each
of
the
novel
formulations
provided
efficient
protection
against
challenge
with
HP-PRRSV
.

Non-severe
clinical
signs
and
rectal
temperatures
were
observed
in
pigs
immunized
with
BPEI/PLGA-SynORF5
compared
with
other
groups
.

Thus
,
these
novel
DNA
constructs
may
represent
promising
candidate
vaccines
against
emerging
HP-PRRSV
.

Background
:
Human
bocavirus
(
HBoV
)
is
a
newly
discovered
parvovirus
and
increasing
evidences
are
available
to
support
its
role
as
an
etiologic
agent
in
lower
respiratory
tract
infection
(
LRTI
)
.

The
objective
of
this
study
is
to
assess
the
impact
of
HBoV
viral
load
on
clinical
characteristics
in
children
who
were
HBoV
positive
and
suffered
severe
LRTI
.

Methods
:
Lower
respiratory
tract
aspirates
from
186
hospitalized
children
with
severe
LRTI
were
obtained
by
bronchoscopy
.

HBoVs
were
detected
by
real-time
PCR
and
other
10
infectious
agents
were
examined
using
PCR
and/or
direct
fluorescent
assay
.

Results
:
Thirty-one
patients
(
24.6
%
)
were
tested
positive
for
HBoV
in
the
respiratory
tract
aspirates
.

Fifteen
samples
had
a
high
viral
load
(
.10
4
copies/mL
)
and
the
other
sixteen
samples
had
a
low
viral
load
(
,10
4
copies/mL
)
.

The
duration
of
presented
wheezing
and
hospitalization
was
longer
in
children
with
high
viral
load
of
HBoV
than
that
in
children
with
low
viral
load
.

The
days
of
wheezing
showed
a
correlation
with
viral
load
of
HBoV
.

Conclusion
:
We
confirmed
that
HBoV
was
frequently
detected
in
patients
with
severe
LRTI
.

Wheezing
was
one
of
the
most
common
symptoms
presented
by
patients
with
positive
HBoV
.

A
high
HBoV
viral
load
could
be
an
etiologic
agent
for
LRTI
,
which
led
to
more
severe
lower
respiratory
tract
symptom
,
longer
duration
of
wheezing
and
hospitalization
.

Influenza
A
viruses
are
important
pathogens
that
cause
acute
respiratory
diseases
and
annual
epidemics
in
humans
.

Macrophages
recognize
influenza
A
virus
infection
with
their
pattern
recognition
receptors
,
and
are
involved
in
the
activation
of
proper
innate
immune
response
.

Here
,
we
have
used
high-throughput
subcellular
proteomics
combined
with
bioinformatics
to
provide
a
global
view
of
host
cellular
events
that
are
activated
in
response
to
influenza
A
virus
infection
in
human
primary
macrophages
.

We
show
that
viral
infection
regulates
the
expression
and/or
subcellular
localization
of
more
than
one
thousand
host
proteins
at
early
phases
of
infection
.

Our
data
reveals
that
there
are
dramatic
changes
in
mitochondrial
and
nuclear
proteomes
in
response
to
infection
.

We
show
that
a
rapid
cytoplasmic
leakage
of
lysosomal
proteins
,
including
cathepsins
,
followed
by
their
secretion
,
contributes
to
inflammasome
activation
and
apoptosis
seen
in
the
infected
macrophages
.

Also
,
our
results
demonstrate
that
P2X
7
receptor
and
src
tyrosine
kinase
activity
are
essential
for
inflammasome
activation
during
influenza
A
virus
infection
.

Finally
,
we
show
that
influenza
A
virus
infection
is
associated
with
robust
secretion
of
different
danger-associated
molecular
patterns
(
DAMPs
)
suggesting
an
important
role
for
DAMPs
in
host
response
to
influenza
A
virus
infection
.

In
conclusion
,
our
high-throughput
quantitative
proteomics
study
provides
important
new
insight
into
host-response
against
influenza
A
virus
infection
in
human
primary
macrophages
.

Thank
you

the
submission
of
your

We
have
now
heard
back
from
two
of
the
three
referees
whom
we
asked
to
evaluate
your
manuscript
.

As
these
two
referees
have
very
similar
recommendations
,
we
decided
to
go
ahead
and
make
a
decision
now
.

Although
referees
do
find
the
study
suitable
for
publication
in
principle
,
referee
2
suggested
expanding
the
discussion
and
providing
additional
explanations
here
and
there
.

We
would
welcome
the
submission
of
a
revised
version
for
further
consideration
and
depending
on
the
nature
of
the
revisions
,
this
may
be
sent
back
or
not
to
the
referees
for
another
round
of
review
.

Eukaryotic
translation
elongation
factors
1
alpha
,
eEF1A1
and
eEF1A2
,
are
not
only
translation
factors
but
also
pleiotropic
proteins
that
are
highly
expressed
in
human
tumors
,
including
breast
cancer
,
ovarian
cancer
,
and
lung
cancer
.

eEF1A1
modulates
cytoskeleton
,
exhibits
chaperone-like
activity
and
also
controls
cell
proliferation
and
cell
death
.

In
contrast
,
eEF1A2
protein
favors
oncogenesis
as
shown
by
the
fact
that
overexpression
of
eEF1A2
leads
to
cellular
transformation
and
gives
rise
to
tumors
in
nude
mice
.

The
eEF1A2
protein
stimulates
the
phospholipid
signaling
and
activates
the
Akt-dependent
cell
migration
and
actin
remodeling
that
ultimately
favors
tumorigenesis
.

In
contrast
,
inactivation
of
eEF1A
proteins
leads
to
immunodeficiency
,
neural
and
muscular
defects
,
and
favors
apoptosis
.

Finally
,
eEF1A
proteins
interact
with
several
viral
proteins
resulting
in
enhanced
viral
replication
,
decreased
apoptosis
,
and
increased
cellular
transformation
.

This
review
summarizes
the
recent
findings
on
eEF1A
proteins
indicating
that
eEF1A
proteins
play
a
critical
role
in
numerous
human
diseases
through
enhancement
of
oncogenesis
,
blockade
of
apoptosis
,
and
increased
viral
pathogenesis

Memory
CD8
T
cells
can
provide
protection
from
re-infection
by
respiratory
viruses
such
as
influenza
and
SARS
.

However
,
the
relative
contribution
of
memory
CD8
T
cells
in
providing
protection
against
respiratory
syncytial
virus
(
RSV
)
infection
is
currently
unclear
.

To
address
this
knowledge
gap
,
we
utilized
a
prime-boost
immunization
approach
to
induce
robust
memory
CD8
T
cell
responses
in
the
absence
of
RSV-specific
CD4
T
cells
and
antibodies
.

Unexpectedly
,
RSV
infection
of
mice
with
pre-existing
CD8
T
cell
memory
led
to
exacerbated
weight
loss
,
pulmonary
disease
,
and
lethal
immunopathology
.

The
exacerbated
disease
in
immunized
mice
was
not
epitope-dependent
and
occurred
despite
a
significant
reduction
in
RSV
viral
titers
.

In
addition
,
the
lethal
immunopathology
was
unique
to
the
context
of
an
RSV
infection
as
mice
were
protected
from
a
normally
lethal
challenge
with
a
recombinant
influenza
virus
expressing
an
RSV
epitope
.

Memory
CD8
T
cells
rapidly
produced
IFN-γ
following
RSV
infection
resulting
in
elevated
protein
levels
in
the
lung
and
periphery
.

Neutralization
of
IFN-γ
in
the
respiratory
tract
reduced
morbidity
and
prevented
mortality
.

These
results
demonstrate
that
in
contrast
to
other
respiratory
viruses
,
RSV-specific
memory
CD8
T
cells
can
induce
lethal
immunopathology
despite
mediating
enhanced
viral
clearance
.

Memory
CD8
T
cells
have
been
shown
to
provide
protection
against
many
respiratory
viruses
.

However
,
the
ability
of
memory
CD8
T
cells
to
provide
protection
against
RSV
has
not
been
extensively
examined
.

Unexpectedly
,

T
cells
and
antibodies
,
exhibited
exacerbated
morbidity

The

infection
(

a
critical

.

During
this

,
components
of

system
such
as
macrophages
and
DCs
,
NK
cells
,
b-defensins
,

and
other
anti-microbial
factors
,
which
have
all
been
implicated
in
modulating
HIV
infection
,
may
play
particularly
important
roles
.

A
proteomics-based
screen
was
performed
on
a
cohort
from
whom
samples
were
available
at
time
points
prior
to
the
earliest
positive
HIV
detection
.

The
ability
of
selected
factors
found
to
be
elevated
in
the
plasma
during
AHI
to
inhibit
HIV-1
replication
was
analyzed
using
in
vitro
PBMC
and
DC
infection
models
.

Analysis
of
unique
plasma
donor
panels
spanning
the
eclipse
and
viral
expansion
phases
revealed
very
early
alterations
in
plasma
proteins
in
AHI
.

Induction
of
acute
phase
protein
serum
amyloid
A
(
A-SAA
)
occurred
as
early
as
5-7
days
prior
to
the
first
detection
of
plasma
viral
RNA
,
considerably
prior
to
any
elevation
in
systemic
cytokine
levels
.

Furthermore
,
a
proteolytic
fragment
of
alpha-1-antitrypsin
(
AAT
)
,
termed
virus
inhibitory
peptide
(
VIRIP
)
,
was
observed
in
plasma
coincident
with
viremia
.

Both
A-SAA
and
VIRIP
have
anti-viral
activity
in
vitro
and
quantitation
of
their
plasma
levels
indicated
that
circulating
concentrations
are
likely
to
be

cytotoxic
effects
have
been
done

the
practical
applications
of
nanoparticles
to
veterinary
medicine
at
present
and
in
the
near
future
.

Several
human
monoclonal
antibodies
(
hmAbs
)
and
antibody
fragments
,
including
the
best
characterized
in
terms
of
structure-function
b12
and
Fab
X5
,
exhibit
relatively
potent
and
broad
HIV-1
neutralizing
activity
.

However
,
the
elicitation
of
b12
or
b12-like
antibodies
in
vivo
by
vaccine
immunogens
based
on
the
HIV-1
envelope
glycoprotein
(
Env
)
has
not
been
successful
.

B12
is
highly
divergent
from
the
closest
corresponding
germline
antibody
while
X5
is
less
divergent
.

We
have
hypothesized
that
the
relatively
high
degree
of
specific
somatic
hypermutations
may
preclude
binding
of
the
HIV-1
envelope
glycoprotein
(
Env
)
to
closest
germline
antibodies
,
and
that
identifying
antibodies
that
are
intermediates
in
the
pathways
to
maturation
could
help
design
novel
vaccine
immunogens
to
guide
the
immune
system
for
their
enhanced
elicitation
.

In
support
of
this
hypothesis
we
have
previously
found
that
a
germline-like
b12
(
monovalent
and
bivalent
scFv
as
an
Fc
fusion
protein
or
IgG
)
lacks
measurable
binding
to
an
Env
as
measured
by
ELISA
with
a
sensitivity
in
the
µM
range
[

]
;
here
we
present
evidence
confirming
and
expanding
these
findings
for
a
panel
of
Envs
.

In
contrast
,
a
germline-like
scFv
X5
bound
Env
with
high
(
nM
)
affinity
.

To
begin
to
explore
the
maturation
pathways
of
these
antibodies
we
identified
several
possible
b12
intermediate
antibodies
and
tested
their
neutralizing
activity
.

These
intermediate
antibodies
neutralized
only
some
HIV-1
isolates
and
with
relatively
weak
potency
.

In
contrast
,
germline-like
scFv
X5
neutralized
a
subset
of
the
tested
HIV-1
isolates
with
comparable
efficiencies
to
that
of
the
mature
X5
.

These
results
could
help
explain
the
relatively
high
immunogenicity
of
the
coreceptor

antibodies

HIV-1infected
patients
(
X5
is
a
CD4i
antibody
)
as
well
as
the
maturation
pathway
of
X5
.

They
also
can
help
identify
antigens
that
can
bind
specifically
to
b12
germline
and
intermediate
antibodies
that
together
with
Envs
could
be
used
as
a
conceptually
novel
type
of
candidate
vaccines
.

Such
candidate
vaccines
based
on
two
or
more
immunogens
could
help
guiding
the
immune
system
through
complex
maturation
pathways
for
elicitation
of
antibodies
that
are
similar
or
identical
to
antibodies
with
known
properties

Background
:
Respiratory
viral
diagnosis
of
upper
respiratory
tract
infections
has
largely
developed
through
multiplex
molecular
techniques
.

Although
the
sensitivity
of
different
types
of
upper
respiratory
tract
samples
seems
to
be
correlated
to
the
number
of
sampled
cells
,
this
link
remains
largely
unexplored
.

Methods
:
Our
study
included
800
upper
respiratory
tract
specimens
of
which
400
negative
and
400
positive
for
viral
detection
in
multiplex
PCR
.

All
samples
were
selected
and
matched
for
age
in
these
2
groups
.

For
the
positive
group
,
samples
were
selected
for
the
detected
viral
species
.

Results
:
Among
the
factors
influencing
the
cellularity
were
the
type
of
sample
(
p
<
0.0001
)
;
patient
age
(
p
<
0.001
)
;
viral
positive
or
negative
nature
of
the
sample
(
p
=
0.002
)
;
and
,
for
the
positive
samples
,
the
number
of
viral
targets
detected
(
0.004
<
p
<
0.049
)
and
viral
species
.

Conclusion
:
The
cellular
load
of
upper
respiratory
samples
is
multifactorial
and
occurs
for
many
in
the
sensitivity
of
molecular
detection
.

it
was
not
possible
to
determine
a
minimum

detection
.

The
differences
according
to
the
type
of
virus
remain
to
be
studied
on
a
larger
scale
.

In
mice
,
plasmacytoid
dendritic
cells
(
pDC
)
and
natural
killer
(
NK
)
cells
both
contribute
to
resistance
to
systemic
infections
with
herpes
viruses
including
mouse
Cytomegalovirus
(
MCMV
)
.

pDCs
are
the
major
source
of
type
I
IFN
(
IFN-I
)
during
MCMV
infection
.

This
response
requires
pDC-intrinsic
MyD88-dependent
signaling
by
Toll-Like
Receptors
7
and
9
.

Provided
that
they
express
appropriate
recognition
receptors
such
as
Ly49H
,
NK
cells
can
directly
sense
and
kill
MCMV-infected
cells
.

The
loss
of
any
one
of
these
responses
increases
susceptibility
to
infection
.

However
,
the
relative
importance
of
these
antiviral
immune
responses
and
how
they
are
related
remain
unclear
.

In
humans
,
while
IFN-I
responses
are
essential
,
MyD88
is
dispensable
for
antiviral
immunity
.

Hence
,
a
higher
redundancy
has
been
proposed
in
the
mechanisms
promoting
protective
immune
responses
against
systemic
infections
by
herpes
viruses
during
natural
infections
in
humans
.

It
has
been
assumed
,
but
not
proven
,
that
mice
fail
to
mount
protective
MyD88-independent
IFN-I
responses
.

In
humans
,
the
mechanism
that
compensates
MyD88
deficiency
has
not
been
elucidated
.

To
address
these
issues
,
we
compared
resistance
to
MCMV
infection
and
immune
responses
between
mouse
strains
deficient
for
MyD88
,
the
IFN-I
receptor
and/or
Ly49H
.

We
show
that
selective
depletion
of
pDC
or
genetic
deficiencies
for
MyD88
or
TLR9
drastically
decreased
production
of
IFN-I
,
but
not
the
protective
antiviral
responses
.

Moreover
,
MyD88
,
but
not
IFN-I
receptor
,
deficiency
could
largely
be
compensated
by
Ly49Hmediated
antiviral
NK
cell
responses
.

Thus
,
contrary
to
the
current
dogma
but
consistent
with
the
situation
in
humans
,
we
conclude
that
,
in
mice
,
in
our
experimental
settings
,
MyD88
is
redundant
for
IFN-I
responses
and
overall
defense
against
a
systemic
herpes
virus
infection
.

Moreover
,
we
identified
direct
NK
cell
sensing
of
infected
cells
as
one
mechanism

Background
:
During
an
infectious
disease
outbreak
,
it
is
critical
to
learn
as
much
as
possible
about
the
concerns
,
knowledge
,
attitudes
,
and
behavior
of
the
public
.

Such
information
can
be
crucial
to
the
improvement
of
communication
efforts
by
public
health
officials
and
clinicians
.

The
aim
of
this
study
was
to
identify
awareness
,
attitudes
,
and
practices
related
to
influenza
A
(
H1N1
)
among
the
Saudi
public
.

Methods
:
A
cross-sectional
study
of
1,548
adult
subjects
recruited
from
various
shopping
malls
in
Riyadh
and
Jeddah
was
conducted
.

All
of
the
subjects
were
interviewed
using
a
questionnaire
that
tested
their
knowledge
,
attitudes
,
and
use
of
precautionary
measures
in
relation
to
the
H1N1
influenza
pandemic
.

Results
:
More
than
half
(
54.3
%
,
840/1548
)
of
the
participants
showed
high
concern
,
43.7
%
(
677/1548
)
showed
a
low
level
of
knowledge
,
and
60.8
%
(
941/1548
)
had
taken
minimal
or
no
precautionary
measures
.

After
adjusting
for
other
variables
,
education
level
was
the
only
significant
predictor
of
the
level
of
concern
(
p
<
0.001
)
,
while
greater
precautionary
measures
were
taken
by
participants
who
were
male
(
p
<
0.001
)
,
older
(
p
=
0.047
)
,
better
educated
(
p
=
0.04
)
,
and
more
knowledgeable
(
p
<
0.001
)
.

More
than
one-third
(
38.3
%
)
of
participants
were
not
convinced
that
the
MOH
reports
about
the
disease
were
true
,
and
only
16.1
%
of
the
participants
reported
receiving
information
from
health
providers
.

Conclusions
:
High
concern
did
not
translate
into
a
higher
compliance
with
precautionary
recommendations
,
possibly
due
to
the
low
level
of
knowledge
about
the
disease
among
the
public
.

Frequent
communication
between
physicians
and
the
public
is
recommended
to
help
dispel
myths
about
the
disease
and
to
spread
better
information
about
the
role
that
the
public
can
play
in
limiting
the
spread
of
the
disease
.

Background
:
Several
studies
have
compared
nasal
swabs
to
the
more
invasive
nasopharyngeal
aspirate
(
NPA
)
for
detection
of
respiratory
viruses
.

Mostly
,
the
comparisons
have
been
performed
on
immunocompetent
children
with
upper
respiratory
tract
symptoms
.

The
results
range
from
a
relatively
poor
sensitivity
for
the
swabs
to
an
even
higher
sensitivity
than
for
the
NPA
.

We
aimed
to
investigate
the
sensitivity
of
a
flocked
nasal
swab
(
fNS
)
on
immunocompromised
adults
with
febrile
neutropenia
.

Methods
:
During
16
months
,
adults
with
a
hematological
disorder
presenting
with
febrile
neutropenia
were
enrolled
in
the
study
.

Paired
samples
of
the
fNS
and
NPA
were
collected
in
the
outer
part
of
the
nasal
cavity
and
the
nasopharynx
,
respectively
.

The
samples
were
analyzed
regarding
a
panel
of
15
respiratory
viruses
by
means
of
quantitative
polymerase
chain
reaction
.

Furthermore
,
as
an
indirect
measure
of
cell
yield
by
either
method
,
the
copy
number
of
the
human
beta
actin
gene
was
also
determined
.

Cohen
's
kappa
was
calculated
as
a
measure
of
agreement
of
the
results
obtained
from
either
method
.

Wilcoxon
signed-rank
test
was
used
for
comparison
of
cell
yield
.

Results
:
A
total
of
98
paired
samples
from
a
total
of
89
patients
were
collected
.

Twenty
of
the
pairs
had
virus
detected
in
at
least
one
of
the
specimens
;
11
in
both
,
7
in
NPA
only
,
and
2
in
fNS
only
.

For
the
fNS
,
the
overall
sensitivity
for
any
virus
and
for
rhinovirus
only
was
65
%
and
78
%
,
respectively
.

NPA
was
significantly
superior
to
the
fNS
in
collecting
epithelial
cells
.

Conclusion
:
We
found
the
overall
sensitivity
of
65
%
to
be
too
low
to
replace

This
active
field
of
research
has
attracted
approximately
110
experts
in
virology
and
bioinformatics/computational
biology
from
Europe
and
other
parts
of
the
world
to
attend
the
two-day
meeting
in
Glasgow
to
increase
scientific
exchange
between
laboratory-and
computer-based
researchers
.

The
meeting
was
held
at
the
McIntyre
Building
of
the
University
of
Glasgow
;
a
perfect
location
,
as
it
was
originally
built
to
be
a
place
for
``
rubbing
your
brains
with
those
of
other
people
''
,
as
Rector
Stanley
Baldwin
described
it
.

The
goal
of
the
meeting
was
to
provide
a
meaningful
and
interactive
scientific
environment
to
promote
discussion
and
collaboration
and
to
inspire
and
suggest
new
research
directions
and
questions
.

The
meeting
featured
eight
invited
and
twelve
contributed
talks
,
on
the
four
main
topics
:
(
1
)
systems
virology
,
(
2
)
virus-host
interactions
and
the
virome
,
(
3
)
virus
classification
and
evolution
and
(
4
)
epidemiology
,
surveillance
and
evolution
.

Further
,
the
meeting
featured
34
oral
poster
presentations
,
all
of
which
focused
on
specific
areas
of
virus

.

This
report
summarizes
the
main
research
findings
and
highlights
presented
at
the
meeting
.

Background
:
Japanese
encephalitis
(
JE
)
,
a
neuroinflammation
caused
by
zoonotic
JE
virus
,
is
the
major
cause
of
viral
encephalitis
worldwide
and
poses
an
increasing
threat
to
global
health
and
welfare
.

To
date
,
however
,
there
has
been
no
report
describing
the
regulation
of
JE
progression
using
immunomodulatory
tools
for
developing
therapeutic
strategies
.

We
tested
whether
blocking
the
4-1BB
signaling
pathway
would
regulate
JE
progression
using
murine
JE
model
.

Methods
:
Infected
wild-type
and
4-1BB-knockout
(
KO
)
mice
were
examined
daily
for
mortality
and
clinical
signs
,
and
neuroinflammation
in
the
CNS
was
evaluated
by
infiltration
of
inflammatory
leukocytes
and
cytokine
expression
.

In
addition
,
viral
burden
,
JEV-specific
T
cell
,
and
type
I/II
IFN
(
IFN-I/II
)
innate
responses
were
analyzed
.

Results
:
Blocking
the
4-1BB
signaling
pathway
significantly
increased
resistance
to
JE
and
reduced
viral
burden
in
extraneural
tissues
and
the
CNS
,
rather
than
causing
a
detrimental
effect
.

In
addition
,
treatment
with
4-1BB
agonistic
antibody
exacerbated
JE
.

Furthermore
,
JE
amelioration
and
reduction
of
viral
burden
by
blocking
the
4-1BB
signaling
pathway
were
associated
with
an
increased
frequency
of
IFN-II-producing
NK
and
CD4
+
Th1
cells
as
well
as
increased
infiltration
of
mature
Ly-6C
hi
monocytes
in
the
inflamed
CNS
.

More
interestingly
,
DCs
and
macrophages
derived
from
4-1BB
KO
mice
showed
potent
and
rapid
IFN-I
innate
immune
responses
upon
JEV
infection
,
which
was
coupled
to
strong
induction
of
PRRs
(
RIG-I
,
MDA5
)
,
transcription
factors
(
IRF7
)
,
and
antiviral
ISG
genes
(
ISG49
,
ISG54
,
ISG56
)
.

Further
,
the
ablation
of
4-1BB
signaling
enhanced
IFN-I
innate
responses
in
neuron
cells
,
which
likely
regulated
viral
spread
in
the
CNS
.

Finally
,
we
confirmed
that
blocking
the
4-1BB
signaling
pathway
in
myeloid
cells
derived
from
hematopoietic
stem
cells
(
HSCs
)
played
a
dominant
role
in
ameliorating
JE
.

In
support
of
this
finding
,
HSC-derived
leukocytes
played
a
dominant
role
in
generating
the
IFN-I
innate
responses
in
the
host
.

The
coronavirus
S-protein
mediates
receptor
binding
and
fusion
of
the
viral
and
host
cell
membranes
.

In
HCoV-229E
,
its
receptor
binding
domain
(
RBD
)
shows
extensive
sequence
variation
but
how
S-protein
function
is
maintained
is
not
understood
.

Reported
are
the
X-ray
crystal
structures
of
Class
III-V
RBDs
in
complex
with
human
aminopeptidase
N
(
hAPN
)
,
as
well
as
the
electron
cryomicroscopy
structure
of
the
229E
S-protein
.

The
structures
show
that
common
core
interactions
define
the
specificity
for
hAPN
and
that
the
peripheral
RBD
sequence
variation
is
accommodated
by
loop
plasticity
.

The
results
provide
insight
into
immune
evasion
and
the
crossspecies
transmission
of
229E
and
related
coronaviruses
.

We
also
find
that
the
229E
S-protein
can
expose
a
portion
of
its
helical
core
to
solvent
.

This
is
undoubtedly
facilitated
by
hydrophilic
subunit
interfaces
that
we
show
are
conserved
among
coronaviruses
.

These
interfaces
likely
play
a
role
in
the
S-protein
conformational
changes
associated
with
membrane
fusion

Bats
are
associated
with
several
important
zoonotic
viruses
from
different
families
.

One
example
includes
adeno-associated
viruses
(
AAVs
)
,
that
are
extensively
detected
in
several
animals
,
especially
primates
.

To
understand
AAVs
distribution
and
genetic
diversity
in
the
coastal
areas
of
Southeast
China
,
a
total
of
415
intestine
samples
were
mostly
collected
from
two
provinces
of
southeast
China
,
i.e.
,
Zhejiang
and
Fujian
province
.

Intestine
samples
from
five
bat
species
were
collected
for
AAVs
detection
.

The
average
prevalence
rate
for
AAV
detection
among
these
samples
was
18.6
%
(
77
positives
out
of
415
samples
)
and
ranged
from
11.8
to
28.9
%
between
the
five
bat
species
.

This
suggests
that
AAVs
are
widely
distributed
in
diverse
bat
populations
in
southeast
coastal
areas
of
China
.

Based
on
the
genome
sequence
of
bat
adeno-associated
virus-CXC1
(
BtAAV-CXC1
)
from
one
AAV-positive
sample
,
the
genetic
diversity
of
the
detected
AAVs
were
assessed
and
analyzed
.

Phylogenetic
analysis
revealed
that
BtAAV-CXC1
was
comparatively
distant
to
other
major
AAVs
from
mammals
and
non-mammals
,
with
only
a
52.9~64.7
%
nucleotide
identity
.

However
,
they
were
phylogenetically
closer
to
Rhinolophus
sinicus
bat
adeno-associated
virus
(
Rs-BtAAV1
)
,
with
a
74.5
%

similarity
.

This

that

.

These
findings
led
us
to

Background
:
Chemokines
and
chemokine
receptors
cooperate
to
promote
immune
cell
recruitment
to
the
central
nervous
system
(
CNS
)
.

In
this
study
,
we
investigated
the
roles
of
CXCR2
and
CXCL1
in
leukocyte
recruitment
to
the
CNS
using
a
murine
model
of
neuroinflammation
.

Methods
:
Wild-type
(
WT
)
,
CXCL1
−/−
,
and
CXCR2
−/−
mice
each
received
an
intracerebroventricular
(
i.c.v
.
)

injection
of
lipopolysaccharide
(
LPS
)
.

Esterase
staining
and
intravital
microscopy
were
performed
to
examine
neutrophil
recruitment
to
the
brain
.

To
assess
endothelial
activation
in
these
mice
,
the
expression
of
adhesion
molecules
was
measured
via
quantitative
real-time
polymerase
chain
reaction
(
PCR
)
and
Western
blotting
.

To
identify
the
cellular
source
of
functional
CXCR2
,
chimeric
mice
were
generated
by
transferring
bone
marrow
cells
between
the
WT
and
CXCR2
−/−
mice
.

Results
:
Expression
levels
of
the
chemokines
CXCL1
,
CXCL2
,
and
CXCL5
were
significantly
increased
in
the
brain
following
the
i.c.v
.

injection
of
LPS
.

CXCR2
or
CXCL1
deficiency
blocked
neutrophil
infiltration
and
leukocyte
recruitment
in
the
cerebral
microvessels
.

In
the
CXCR2
−/−
and
CXCL1
−/−
mice
,
the
cerebral
endothelial
expression
of
adhesion
molecules
such
as
P-selectin
and
VCAM-1
was
dramatically
reduced
.

Furthermore
,
the
bone
marrow
transfer
experiments
demonstrated
that
CXCR2
expression
on
CNS-residing
cells
is
essential
for
cerebral
endothelial
activation
and
leukocyte
recruitment
.

Compared
with
microglia
,
cultured
astrocytes
secreted
a
much
higher
level
of
CXCL1
in
vitro
.

Astrocyte
culture
conditioned
medium
significantly
increased
the
expression
of
VCAM-1
and
ICAM-1
in
cerebral
endothelial
cells
in
a
CXCR2-dependent
manner
.

Additionally
,
CXCR2
messenger
RNA
(
mRNA
)
expression
in
cerebral
endothelial
cells
but
not
in
microglia
or
astrocytes
was
increased
following
tumor
necrosis
factor-α
(
TNF-α
)
stimulation
.

The
intravenous
injection
of
the
CXCR2
antagonist
SB225002
significantly
inhibited
endothelial
activation
and
leukocyte
recruitment
to
cerebral
microvessels
.

Conclusions
:
CXCL1
secreted
by
astrocytes
and
endothelial
CXCR2
play
essential
roles
in
cerebral
endothelial
activation
and
subsequent
leukocyte
recruitment
during
neuroinflammation

Background
:
The
2002-2003
Severe
Acute
Respiratory
Syndrome
(
SARS
)
outbreak
infected
8,422
individuals
leading
to
916
deaths
around
the
world
.

However
,
there
have
been
few
epidemiological
studies
of
SARS
comparing
epidemiologic
features
across
regions
.

The
aim
of
this
study
is
to
identify
similarities
and
differences
in
SARS
epidemiology
in
three
populations
with
similar
host
and
viral
genotype
.

We
present
a
comparative
epidemiologic
analysis
of
SARS
,
based
on
an
integrated
dataset
with
3,336
SARS
patients
from
Hong
Kong
,
Beijing
and
Taiwan
,
epidemiological
and
clinical
characteristics
such
as
incubation
,
onset-to-admission
,
onset-to-discharge
and
onset-to-death
periods
,
case
fatality
ratios
(
CFRs
)
and
presenting
symptoms
are
described
and
compared
between
regions
.

We
further
explored
the
influence
of
demographic
and
clinical
variables
on
the
apparently
large
differences
in
CFRs
between
the
three
regions
.

Results
:
All
three
regions
showed
similar
incubation
periods
and
progressive
shortening
of
the
onset-to-admission
interval
through
the
epidemic
.

Adjusted
for
sex
,
health
care
worker
status
and
nosocomial
setting
,
older
age
was
associated
with
a
higher
fatality
,
with
adjusted
odds
ratio
(
AOR
)
:
2.10
(
95

for

aged
51-60
;
AOR

(
95
%

interval
:
3.32
,
7.30
)
for
those
aged
above
60
compared
to
those
aged
41-50
years
.

Presence
of
pre-existing
comorbid
conditions
was
also
associated
with
greater
mortality
(
AOR
:
1.74
;
95
%
confidence
interval
:

,

)
.

The
large
discrepancy
in
crude
fatality
ratios
across
the
three
regions
can
only
be
partly
explained
by
epidemiological
and
clinical
heterogeneities
.

Our
findings
underline
the
importance
of
a
common
data
collection
platform
,
especially
in
an
emerging
epidemic
,
in
order
to
identify
and
explain
consistencies
and
differences
in
the
eventual
clinical
and
public
health
outcomes
of
infectious
disease
outbreaks
,
which
is
becoming
increasingly
important
in
our
highly
interconnected
world
.

RNA
viruses
are
the
only
known
RNA-protein
(
RNP
)
entities
capable
of
autonomous
replication
(
albeit
within
a
permissive
host
environment
)
.

A
33.5
kilobase
(
kb
)
nidovirus
has
been
considered
close
to
the
upper
size
limit
for
such
entities
;
conversely
,
the
minimal
cellular
DNA
genome
is
in
the
100-300
kb
range
.

This
large
difference
presents
a
daunting
gap
for
the
transition
from
primordial
RNP
to
contemporary
DNA-RNP-based
life
.

Whether
or
not
RNA
viruses
represent
transitional
steps
towards
DNA-based
life
,
studies
of
larger
RNA
viruses
advance
our
understanding
of
the
size
constraints
on
RNP
entities
and
the
role
of
genome
size
in
virus
adaptation
.

For
example
,
emergence
of
the
largest
previously
known
RNA
genomes
(
20-34
kb
in
positive-stranded
nidoviruses
,
including
coronaviruses
)
is
associated
with
the
acquisition
of
a
proofreading
exoribonuclease
(
ExoN
)
encoded
in
the
open
reading
frame
1b
(
ORF1b
)
in
a
monophyletic
subset
of
nidoviruses
.

However
,
apparent
constraints
on
the
size
of
ORF1b
,
which
encodes
this
and
other
key
replicative
enzymes
,
have
been
hypothesized
to
limit
further
expansion
of
these
viral
RNA
genomes
.

Here
,
we
characterize
a
novel
nidovirus
(
planarian
secretory
cell
nidovirus
;
PSCNV
)
whose
disproportionately
large
ORF1b-like
region
including
unannotated
domains
,
and
overall
41.1-kb
genome
,
substantially
extend
the
presumed
limits
on
RNA
genome
size
.

This
genome
encodes
a
predicted
13,556-aa
polyprotein
in
an
unconventional
single
ORF
,
yet
retains
canonical
nidoviral
genome
organization
and
expression
,
as
well
as
key
replicative
domains
.

These
domains
may
include
functionally
relevant
substitutions
rarely
or
never
before
observed
in
highly
conserved
sites
of
RdRp
,
NiRAN
,
ExoN
and
3CLpro
.

Our
evolutionary
analysis
suggests
that
PSCNV
diverged
early
from
multi-ORF
nidoviruses
,
and
acquired
additional
genes
,
including
those
typical
of
large
DNA
viruses
or
hosts
,
e.g
.

Ankyrin
and
Fibronectin
type
II
,
which
might
modulate
virus-host
interactions
.

The
risk
of
bacteremia
is
considered
low
in

.

However
the
rate
of
occult
bacteremia
in
infants
with
RSV

is
not
well
established
.

The

factors
of

spread
to
several
other
countries
,
most
confirmed
cases
have
displayed
symptoms
of
severe
acute
respiratory
illness
and
many
of
these
patients
have
died
.

This
research
is
aimed
to
construct
a
mathematical
model
for
the
transmission
of
MERS-CoV
in
two
areas
by
separating
the
human
population
into
two
groups
;
susceptible
and
infectious
groups
.

The
dynamics
of
the
disease
is
studied
by
a
compartmental
model
involving
ordinary
differrential
equations
.

The
basic
reproductive
number
of
this
disease
is
discussed
to
control
the
outbreak
of
this
disease
.

Sensitivity
analysis
of
this
model
is
performed
to
determine
the
relative
importance
of
the

The
clinical
impact
of
viral
factors
(
types
and
viral
loads
)
during
respiratory
syncytial
virus
(
RSV
)
infection
is
still
controversial
,
especially
regarding
newly
described
genotypes
.

In
this
study
,
infants
with
RSV
bronchiolitis
were
recruited
to
describe
the
association
of
these
viral
factors
with
severity
of
infection
.

RSV
antigenic
types
,
genotypes
,
and
viral
loads
were
determined
from
hospitalized
patients
at
Hospital
Roberto
del
Río
,
Santiago
,
Chile
.

Cases
were
characterized
by
demographic
and
clinical
information
,
including
days
of
lower
respiratory
symptoms
and
severity
.

A
total
of
86
patients
were
included
:
49
moderate
and
37
severe
cases
.

During
2013
,
RSV-A
was
dominant
(
86
%
)
.

RSV-B
predominated
in
2014
(
92
%
)
.

Phylogenetic
analyses
revealed
circulation
of
GA2
,
Buenos
Aires
(
BA
)
,
and
Ontario
(
ON
)
genotypes
.

No
association
was
observed
between
severity
of
infection
and
RSV
group
(
p
=
0.69
)
or
genotype
(
p
=
0.87
)
.

After
a
clinical
categorization
of
duration
of
illness
,
higher
RSV
genomic
loads
were
detected
in
infants
evaluated
earlier
in
their
disease
(
p
<
0.001
)
and
also
in
infants
evaluated
later
,
but
coursing
a
more
severe
infection
(
p
=
0.04
)
.

Although
types
and
genotypes
did
not
associate
with
severity
in
our
children
,
higher
RSV
genomic
loads
and
delayed
viral
clearance
in
severe
patients
define
a
group
that
might
benefit
from
new
antiviral
therapies
.

New
Delhi
metallo-beta-lactamase
(
NDM-1
)
is
an
enzyme
that
makes
bacteria
resistant
to
a
broad
range
of
beta-lactam
antibiotic
drugs
.

This
is
because
it
can
inactivate
most
beta-lactam
antibiotic
drugs
by
hydrolyzing
them
.

For
in-depth
understanding
of
the
hydrolysis
mechanism
,
the
three-dimensional
structure
of
NDM-1
was
developed
.

With
such
a
structural
frame
,
two
enzyme-ligand
complexes
were
derived
by
respectively
docking
Imipenem
and
Meropenem
(
two
typical
betalactam
antibiotic
drugs
)
to
the
NDM-1
receptor
.

It
was
revealed
from
the
NDM-1/Imipenem
complex
that
the
antibiotic
drug
was
hydrolyzed
while
sitting
in
a
binding
pocket
of
NDM-1
formed
by
nine
residues
.

And
for
the
case
of
NDM-1/Meropenem
complex
,
the
antibiotic
drug
was
hydrolyzed
in
a
binding
pocket
formed
by
twelve
residues
.

All
these
constituent
residues
of
the
two
binding
pockets
were
explicitly
defined
and
graphically
labeled
.

It
is
anticipated
that
the
findings
reported
here
may
provide
useful
insights
for
developing
new
antibiotic
drugs
to
overcome
the
resistance
problem
.

The
A2MC2
serially
passaged
90
times
(
A2MC2-P90
)
retains
the
feature
of
interferon
induction
.

The
A2MC2-P90
replicates
faster
with
a
higher
virus
yield
than
wild
type
A2MC2
virus
.

Infection
of
primary
pulmonary
alveolar
macrophages
(
PAMs
)
also
induces
interferons
.

Sequence
analysis
showed
that
the
A2MC2-P90
has
genomic
nucleic
acid
identity
of
99.8
%
to
the
wild
type
but
has
a
deletion
of
543
nucleotides
in
nsp2
.

The
deletion
occurred
in
passage
60
.

The
A2MC2-P90
genome
has
a
total
of
35
nucleotide
variations
from
the
wild
type
,
leading
to
26
amino
acid
differences
.

Inoculation
of
three-week-old
piglets
showed
that
A2MC2-P90
is
avirulent
and
elicits
immune
response
.

Compared
with
Ingelvac
PRRS

strain
,
A2MC2-P90
elicits
higher
virus
neutralizing
antibodies
.

The
attenuated
IFN-inducing
A2MC2-P90
should
be
useful
for
development
of
an
improved
PRRSV

The
causative
agent
of
the

PRRSV
appears
to
inhibit

in
both
PAMs

are
critical
to
the

Presence
of
the
exogenous

Studies
have
shown
that
simultaneous
infection
of
the
respiratory
tract
with
at
least
two
viruses
is
common
in
hospitalized
patients
,
although
it
is
not
clear
whether
these
infections
are
more
or
less
severe
than
single
virus
infections
.

We
use
a
mathematical
model
to
study
the
dynamics
of
viral
coinfection
of
the
respiratory
tract
in
an
effort
to
understand
the
kinetics
of
these
infections
.

Specifically
,
we
use
our
model
to
investigate
coinfections
of
influenza
,
respiratory
syncytial
virus
,
rhinovirus
,
parainfluenza
virus
,
and
human
metapneumovirus
.

Our
study
shows
that
during
coinfections
,
one
virus
can
block
another
simply
by
being
the
first
to
infect
the
available
host
cells
;
there
is
no
need
for
viral
interference
through
immune
response
interactions
.

We
use
the
model
to
calculate
the
duration
of
detectable
coinfection
and
examine
how
it
varies
as
initial
viral
dose
and
time
of
infection
are
varied
.

We
find
that
rhinovirus
,
the
fastest-growing
virus
,
reduces
replication
of
the
remaining
viruses
during
a
coinfection
,
while
parainfluenza
virus
,
the
slowest-growing
virus
is
suppressed
in
the
presence
of
other
viruses

In
the
present

,
we
searched
for
new
M2
channel
inhibitors
through
a
combination
of
different
computational
methodologies
,
including
virtual
screening
with
docking
and
pharmacophore
modeling
.

Virtual
screening
was
performed
to
calculate
the
free
energies
of
binding
between
receptor
M2
channel
proteins
and
200
new

After
