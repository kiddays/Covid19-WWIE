Culture
and
genetics
rely
on
two
distinct
but
not
isolated
transmission
systems
.
.....
Cultural
processes
may
change
the
human
selective
environment
and
thereby
affect
which
individuals
survive
and
reproduce
.
.....
Here
,
we
evaluated
whether
the
modes
of
subsistence
in
Native
American
populations
and
the
frequencies
of
the
ABCA1*Arg230Cys
polymorphism
were
correlated
.
.....
Further
,
we
examined
whether
the
evolutionary
consequences
of
the
agriculturally
constructed
niche
in
Mesoamerica
could
be
considered
as
a
gene-culture
coevolution
model
.
.....
For
this
purpose
,
we
genotyped
229
individuals
affiliated
with
19
Native
American
populations
and
added
data
for
41
other
Native
American
groups
(
n
=
1905
)
to
the
analysis
.
.....
In
combination
with
the
SNP
cluster
of
a
neutral
region
,
this
dataset
was
then
used
to
unravel
the
scenario
involved
in
230Cys
evolutionary
history
.
.....
The
estimated
age
of
230Cys
is
compatible
with
its
origin
occurring
in
the
American
continent
.
.....
The
correlation
of
its
frequencies
with
the
archeological
data
on
Zea
pollen
in
Mesoamerica/Central
America
,
the
neutral
coalescent
simulations
,
and
the
F
ST
-based
natural
selection
analysis
suggest
that
maize
domestication
was
the
driving
force
in
the
increase
in
the
frequencies
of
230Cys
in
this
region
.
.....
These
results
may
represent
the
first
example
of
a
gene-culture
coevolution
involving
an
autochthonous
American
allele

Conclusion
:
T.

Herpes
simplex
virus
type
1
(
HSV1
)
,
when
present
in
brain
of
carriers
of
the
type
4
allele
of
the
apolipoprotein
E
gene
(
APOE
)
,
has
been
implicated
as
a
major
factor
in
Alzheimer
's
disease
(
AD
)
.
.....
It
is
proposed
that
virus
is
normally
latent
in
many
elderly
brains
but
reactivates
periodically
(
as
in
the
peripheral
nervous
system
)
under
certain
conditions
,
for
example
stress
,
immunosuppression
,
and
peripheral
infection
,
causing
cumulative
damage
and
eventually
development
of
AD
.
.....
Diverse
approaches
have
provided
data
that
explicitly
support
,
directly
or
indirectly
,
these
concepts
.
.....
Several
have
confirmed
HSV1
DNA
presence
in
human
brains
,
and
the
HSV1-APOE-ε4
association
in
AD
.
.....
Further
,
studies
on
HSV1-infected
APOE-transgenic
mice
have
shown
that
APOE-e4
animals
display
a
greater
potential
for
viral
damage
.
.....
Reactivated
HSV1
can
cause
direct
and
inflammatory
damage
,
probably
involving
increased
formation
of
beta
amyloid
(
Aβ
)
and
of
AD-like
tau
(
P-tau
)
-changes
found
to
occur
in
HSV1-infected
cell
cultures
.
.....
Implicating
HSV1
further
in
AD
is
the
discovery
that
HSV1
DNA
is
specifically
localized
in
amyloid
plaques
in
AD
.
.....
Other
relevant
,
harmful
effects
of
infection
include
the
following
:
dynamic
interactions
between
HSV1
and
amyloid
precursor
protein
(
APP
)
,
which
would
affect
both
viral
and
APP
transport
;
induction
of
toll-like
receptors
(
TLRs
)
in
HSV1-infected
astrocyte
cultures
,
which
has
been
linked
to
the
likely
effects
of
reactivation
of
the
virus
in
brain
.
.....
Several
epidemiological
studies
have
shown
,
using
serological
data
,
an
association
between
systemic
infections
and
cognitive
decline
,
with
HSV1
particularly
implicated
.
.....
Genetic
studies
too
have
linked
various
pathways
in
AD
with
those
occurring
on
HSV1
infection
.
.....
In
relation
to
the
potential
usage
of
antivirals
to
treat
AD
patients
,
acyclovir
(
ACV
)
is
effective
in
reducing
HSV1-induced
AD-like
changes
in
cell
cultures
,
and
valacyclovir
,
the
bioactive
form
of
ACV
,
might
be
most
effective
if
combined
with
an
antiviral
that
acts
by
a
different
mechanism
,
such
as
intravenous
immunoglobulin
(
IVIG
)
.
.....
Background
:
Porcine
parvovirus
(
PPV

Reactive
oxygen
species
(
ROS
)
,
a
mediator
of
cell
apoptosis
,
play
a
crucial
role
in
the
mitochondria
apoptotic
pathway
.
.....
However
,
whether
PPV
infection
induces
ST
cells
apoptosis
and
ROS
accumulation
is
still
unclear
.
.....
Methods
:
To
determine
the
effects
of
PPV
infection
on
the
apoptosis
,
we
detected
morphological
changes
,
DNA
ladder
,
activities
of
caspases
,
and
expression
of
PARP
in
PPV-infected
ST
cells
.
.....
Moreover
,
aiming
to
investigate
the
effect
of
PPV
infection
on
the
mitochondrial
apoptotic
pathway
and
ROS
accumulation
,
we
detected
the
Δψm
,
apoptosis-related
genes
,
and
ROS
.
.....
To
investigate
the
role
of
ROS
in
the
process
of
PPV-induced
apoptosis
,
the
ST
cells
were
infected
with
PPV
and
treated
with
the
ROS
antioxidants
.
.....
The
ROS
level
was
measured
using
Reactive
Oxygen
Species
Assay
Kit
and
the
Δψm
,
expression
level
of
Bcl-2
,
translocation
of
Bax
,
and
redistribution
of
mitochondria
cytochrome
c
were
tested
.
.....
In
this
study
,
we
demonstrated
that
PPV
infection
could
induce
apoptosis
that
was
characterized
by
morphological
changes
,
DNA
fragmentation
and
activation
of
caspases
.
.....
Moreover
,
PPV
infection
suppressed
Bcl-2
expression
,
enhanced
Bax
expression
and
translocation
to
mitochondria
,
decreased
the
mitochondrial
transmembrane
potential
,
and
triggered
the
release
of
cytochrome
c
,
which
caused
the
subsequent
activation
of
caspase-9
and
caspase-3
and
initiation
of
apoptosis
.
.....
However
,
during
the
process
of
PPV-induced
apoptosis
,
the
protein
levels
of
Fas
and
FasL
were
not
affected
.
.....
Further
studies
showed
that
PPV
infection
caused
ROS
accumulation
.
.....
Inhibition
of
ROS
could
reduce
mitochondrial
transmembrane
potential
and
could
significantly
block
ST
cells
apoptosis
via
suppressing
Bax
translocation
,
cytochrome
c
and
caspase-3
activation
.
.....
Conclusions
:
All
these
results
suggest
that
PPV-induced
ROS
accumulation
mediates
apoptosis
in
ST
cells
,
which
provided
theoretical
basis
for
the
molecular
pathogenesis
of
PPV
infection
.

The
rapid
advancement
of
molecular
tools

the
past
15
years
has
allowed
for
the
retrospective
discovery
of
several
new
respiratory
viruses
as
well
as
the
characterization
of
novel

.....
The
inability
to
characterize
the
etiological
origins
of
respiratory
conditions
,
particularly
in
children
,
led
several
researchers
to
pursue
the
discovery
of
the
underlying
etiology
of
disease
.
.....
In
2001
,
this
led
to
the
discovery
of
human
metapneumovirus

)
and
soon
following
that
the
outbreak

the
most
current
clinical
and
epidemiological
findings

Background
:
As
internet
and
social
media
use
have
skyrocketed
,
epidemiologists
have
begun
to
use
online
data
such
as
Google

and
Twitter
trends
to
track
the

In
China
,
Weibo

an
extremely
popular
microblogging

Capitalizing
on
the
wealth
of
public
opinion
data
contained
in
posts
on

,
this

the
Chinese
people
's
reactions
to
two
different
outbreaks
:
the
2012

outbreak
,
and
the
2013
outbreak
of
human
infection
of
avian
influenza

(
H7N9
)
in

Methods
:
Keyword

collected
by
The
University
of

Baseline
values
were
determined
for
each

and
reaction
values
per
million

in
the
days
after
outbreak
information
was
released
to
the
public
.
.....
Results
:
The
results
show
that
the
Chinese
people
reacted
significantly
to
both
outbreaks
online
,
where
their
social

reaction
was
two
orders
of
magnitude
stronger
to
the
H7N9
influenza
outbreak
that
happened
in
China
than
the
MERS-CoV
outbreak
that
was
far
away
from
China
.
.....
Conclusions
:
These
results
demonstrate
that
social

could
be
a
useful
measure
of
public
awareness
and
reaction
to

Background
:
Poisson
regression
modeling
has
been
widely
used
to
estimate
influenza-associated
disease
burden
,
as
it
has
the
advantage
of
adjusting
for
multiple
seasonal
confounders
.
.....
However
,
few
studies
have
discussed
how
to
judge
the
adequacy
of
confounding
adjustment
.
.....
This
study
aims
to
compare
the
performance
of
commonly
adopted
model
selection
criteria
in
terms
of
providing
a
reliable
and
valid
estimate
for
the
health
impact
of
influenza
.
.....
Methods
:
We
assessed
four
model
selection
criteria
:
quasi
Akaike
information
criterion
(
QAIC
)
,
quasi
Bayesian
information
criterion
(
QBIC
)
,
partial
autocorrelation
functions
of
residuals
(
PACF
)
,
and
generalized
cross-validation
(
GCV
)
,
by
separately
applying
them
to
select
the
Poisson
model
best
fitted
to
the
mortality
datasets
that
were
simulated
under
the
different
assumptions
of
seasonal
confounding
.
.....
The
performance
of
these
criteria
was
evaluated
by
the
bias
and
root-mean-square
error
(
RMSE
)
of
estimates
from
the
pre-determined
coefficients
of
influenza
proxy
variable
.
.....
These
four
criteria
were
subsequently
applied
to
an
empirical
hospitalization
dataset
to
confirm
the
findings
of
simulation
study
.
.....
Results
:
GCV
consistently
provided
smaller

periods
and
lag
weeks
showed
that
GCV
consistently
outperformed
the
other
criteria
.
.....
Similar
results
were
found
in
applying
these
selection
criteria
to
estimate
influenza-associated
hospitalization
.
.....
Conclusions
:
GCV
criterion
is
recommended
for
selection
of
Poisson
models
to
estimate
influenza-associated
mortality
and
morbidity
burden
with
proper
adjustment
for
confounding
.
.....
These
findings
shall
help
standardize
the
Poisson
modeling
approach
for
influenza
disease
burden
studies
.
.....
Here
,
using
mouse
squamous
cell
carcinoma
cells
,
we
report
a
completely
new
function
for
the
autophagy
protein
Ambra1
as
the
first
described
'spatial
rheostat
'
controlling
the
Src/FAK
pathway
.
.....
Ambra1
regulates
the
targeting
of
active
phospho-Src
away
from
focal
adhesions
into
autophagic
structures
that
cancer
cells
use
to
survive
adhesion
stress
.
.....
Ambra1
binds
to
both
FAK
and
Src
in
cancer
cells
.
.....
When
FAK
is
present
,
Ambra1
is
recruited
to
focal
adhesions
,
promoting
FAK-regulated
cancer
cell
direction-sensing
and
invasion
.
.....
However
,
when
Ambra1
can
not
bind
to
FAK
,
abnormally
high
levels
of
phospho-Src
and
phospho-FAK
accumulate
at
focal
adhesions
,
positively
regulating
adhesion
and
invasive
migration
.
.....
Spatial
control
of
active
Src
requires
the
trafficking
proteins
Dynactin
one
and
IFITM3
,
which
we
identified
as
Ambra1
binding
partners
by
interaction
proteomics
.
.....
We
conclude
that
Ambra1
is
a
core
component
of
an
intracellular
trafficking
network
linked
to
tight
spatial
control
of
active
Src
and
FAK
levels
,
and
so
crucially
regulates
their
cancer-associated
biological
outputs
.
.....
We
have
developed
a
high-resolution
genomic
mapping
technique
that
combines
transposon-mediated
insertional
mutagenesis
with
either
capillary
electrophoresis
or
massively
parallel
sequencing
to
identify
functionally
important
regions
of
the
Venezuelan
equine
encephalitis
virus
(
VEEV
)
genome
.
.....
We
initially
used
a
capillary
electrophoresis
method
to
gain
insight
into
the
role
of
the
VEEV
nonstructural
protein
3
(
nsP3
)
in
viral
replication
.
.....
We
identified
several
regions
in
nsP3
that
are
intolerant
to
small
(
15
bp
)
insertions
,
and
thus
are
presumably
functionally
important
.
.....
We
also
identified
nine
separate
regions
in
nsP3
that
will
tolerate
small
insertions
at
low
temperatures
(
30uC
)
,
but
not
at
higher
temperatures
(
37uC
,
and
40uC
)
.
.....
Because
we
found
this
method
to
be
extremely
effective
at
identifying
temperature
sensitive
(
ts
)
mutations
,
but
limited
by
capillary
electrophoresis
capacity
,
we
replaced
the
capillary
electrophoresis
with
massively
parallel
sequencing
and
used
the
improved
method
to
generate
a
functional
map
of
the
entire
VEEV
genome
.
.....
We
identified
several
hundred
potential
ts
mutations
throughout
the
genome
and
we
validated
several
of
the
mutations
in
nsP2
,
nsP3
,
E3
,
E2
,
E1
and
capsid
using
single-cycle
growth
curve
experiments
with
virus
generated
through
reverse
genetics
.
.....
We
further
demonstrated
that
two
of
the
nsP3
ts
mutants
were
attenuated
for
virulence
in
mice
but
could
elicit
protective
immunity
against
challenge
with
wild-type
VEEV
.
.....
The
recombinant
ts
mutants
will
be
valuable
tools
for
further
studies
of
VEEV
replication
and
virulence
.
.....
Moreover
,
the
method
that
we
developed
is
applicable
for
generating
such
tools
for
any
virus
with
a
robust
reverse
genetics
system
.

an
infectious
disease
that
causes
serious
economic
losses

.
.....
To
better
understand
the
pathogenesis
of
the
porcine
reproductive
and
respiratory
syndrome
virus
(
PRRSV
)
,
three
PRRSV
strains
with
different
molecular
markers
and
virulence
were
used
to
infect
MARC-145
cells
.
.....
A
total
of
1804
proteins
were
identified
,
and
233
altered
proteins
and
72
signaling
pathways
involved
in
the
proteomic
profiling
of
virus-infected
MARC-145
cells
increased
with
the
virulence
of
the
PRRSV
strain
.
.....
The
three
types
of
viral
strains
shared
a
common
pathway-the
electron
transport
reaction
in
mitochondria-in
the
infected-MARC-145
cells
.
.....
Moreover
,
the
antisense
pathway
was
the
most
variable
of
all
significant
signaling
pathways
for
the
highly
virulent
SX-1
strain
,
indicating
that
this
unique
pathway
may
be
connected
to
the
high
virulence
of
the
SX-1
strain
.
.....
Our
study
is
the
first
attempt
to
provide
a
proteome
profile
of
MARC-145
cells
infected
with
PRRSV
strains
with
different
virulence
,
and
these
findings
will
facilitate
a
deep
understanding
of
the
interactions
between
this
virus
and
its
host
.

The
porcine
reproductive
and

virus
(
PRRSV
)
,
the
causative
agent
of
porcine
reproductive
and
respiratory
syndrome
(
PRRS
)
,
is
an
important
pathogen
in
the
swine
industry
,
and
it
causes
reproductive
failure
in
pregnant
sows
and
respiratory
disorders
in
pigs
of
all
ages

.
.....
As
a
member
of
the
Arteriviridae
family
,
PRRSV
is
an
enveloped
,
linear
,
single
positive-stranded
RNA
virus
,
and
it
is
similar
to
the
equine
arteritis
virus
,
lactate
dehydrogenase-elevating
virus
,
and
simian
hemorrhagic
fever
virus
2
.
.....
PRRSV
can
be
classified
into
two
distinct
genotypes
:
type
1
(
European
type
)
and
type
2
(
North
American
type
)
3,4
.

In
vivo
,
this
virus
mainly
infects
pulmonary
alveolar
macrophages
(
PAMs
)
5-7
,
whereas
in

,
MARC-145
cells
are
a
good
platform
to

In
life
cycle
of
cells
,
there
are
some
natural
antisense
transcripts
(
NATs
)
,
which
are
reverse
complementarity
with
mRNAs
12
.
.....
These
NATs
,
also
named
antisense
RNAs
or
natural
regulatory
RNAs
,
are
small
molecules
and
non-coding
RNAs
,
mediating
regulation
and
generally
inhibiting
mRNA
transcription
and/or
translation
or
inducing
their
rapid
degradation

.
.....
Signals
regarding
antisense
RNA
transcription
and
regulation
were
named
the
antisense
pathway
,
in
which
PSF
(
Polypyrimidine
tract-binding
protein-associated-splicing
factor
)
,
P54
(
Non-POU
domain-containing
octamer-binding
protein
)
and
MATR3
(
matrin-3
)
are
major
proteins
15-17
.
.....
PSF
is
a
DNA-and
RNA-binding
protein
,
involved
in
regulation
of
signal-induced
alternative
splicing
and
homologous
DNA
pairing
18
.
.....
The
PSF-P54
heterodimer
associated
with
MATR3
may
play
a
role
in
nuclear
retention
of
defective
RNAs

PSF
also
binds
to

The
New
Delhi
Metallo-b-lactamase
(
NDM-1
)
was
first
reported
in
2009
in
a
Swedish
patient
.
.....
A
recent
study
reported
that
Klebsiella
pneumonia
NDM-1
positive
strain
or
Escherichia
coli
NDM-1
positive
strain
was
highly
resistant
to
all
antibiotics
tested
except
tigecycline
and
colistin
.
.....
These
can
no
longer
be
relied
on
to
treat
infections
and
therefore
,
NDM-1
now
becomes
potentially
a
major
global
health
threat
.
.....
In
this
study
,
we
performed
modeling
studies
to
obtain
its
3D
structure
and
NDM-1/antibiotics
complex
.
.....
It
revealed
that
the
hydrolytic
mechanisms
are
highly
conserved
.
.....
In
addition
,
the
detailed
analysis
indicates
that
the
more
flexible
and
hydrophobic
loop1
,
together
with
the
evolution
of
more
positive-charged
loop2
leads
to
NDM-1
positive
strain
more
potent
and
extensive
in
antibiotics
resistance
compared
with
other
MBLs
.
.....
Furthermore
,
through
biological
experiments
,
we
revealed
the
molecular
basis
for
antibiotics
catalysis
of
NDM-1
on
the
enzymatic
level
.
.....
We
found
that
NDM-1
enzyme
was
highly
potent
to
degrade
carbapenem
antibiotics
,
while
mostly
susceptible
to
tigecycline
,
which
had
the
ability
to
slow
down
the
hydrolysis
velocity
of
meropenem
by
NDM-1
.
.....
Meanwhile
,
the
mutagenesis
experiments
,
including
D124A
,
C208A
,
K211A
and
K211E
,
which
displayed
down-regulation
on
meropenem
catalysis
,
proved
the
accuracy
of
our
model
.
.....
At
present
,
there
are
no
effective
antibiotics
against
NDM-1
positive
pathogen
.
.....
Our
study
will
provide
clues
to
investigate
the
molecular
basis
of
extended
antibiotics
resistance
of
NDM-1
and
then
accelerate
the
search
for
new
antibiotics
against
NDM-1
positive
strain
in
clinical
studies

Citation
classics
represent
the
highest
impact
work
in
a
given
field
.
.....
We
aim
to
identify
and
analyze
the
most
frequently
cited
papers
on
brucellosis
.
.....
We
used
the
databases
Scopus
and
Web
of
Science
to
determine
the
most
frequently
cited
papers
.
.....
The
most
cited
fifty
papers
in
each
database
were
identified
.
.....
We
then
ranked
the
papers
according
to
the
highest
citation
count
recorded
from
any
of
the
two
databases
.
.....
The
most
frequently
cited
paper
received
964
citations
and
was
by
DelVecchio
VG
et
al
.
.....
reporting
the
complete
genomic
sequencing
of
Brucella
melitensis
.
.....
The
papers
were
published
in
30
journals
led
by
the
``
Infection
and
Immunity
''
journal
and
the
``
Veterinary
Microbiology
''
journal
(
each
had
7
papers
)
.
.....
Citation
classics
in
brucellosis
were
all
in
English
except
one
in
French
and
were
mostly
of
basic
science
type
.
.....
In
addition
,
we
noticed
that
12
articles
that
were
identified
among
the
highest
fifty
articles
in
one
database
were
missed
by
the
other
database
and
vice
versa
.
.....
Therefore
,
we
suggest
that
searching
in
more
than
one
database
would
detect
additional
citation
classics
.

Background
:
In
the
United
States
(
US
)
,
Medical
Examiners
and
Coroners
(
ME/Cs
)
have
the
legal
authority
for
the
management
of
mass
fatality
incidents
(
MFI
)
.
.....
Yet
,
preparedness
and
operational
capabilities
in
this
sector
remain
largely
unknown
.
.....
The
purpose
of
this
study
was
twofold
;
first
,
to
identify
appropriate
measures
of
preparedness
,
and
second
,
to
assess
preparedness
levels
and
factors
significantly
associated
with
preparedness
.
.....
Methods
:
Three
separate
checklists
were
developed
to
measure
different
aspects
of
preparedness
:
MFI
Plan
Elements
,
Operational
Capabilities
,
and
Pre-existing
Resource
Networks
.
.....
Using
a
cross-sectional
study
design
,
data
on
these
and
other
variables
of
interest
were
collected
in
2014
from
a
national
convenience
sample
of
ME/C
using
an
internet-based
,
anonymous
survey
.
.....
Preparedness
levels
were
determined
and
compared
across
Federal
Regions
and
in
relation
to
the
number
of
Presidential
Disaster
Declarations
,
also
by
Federal
Region
.
.....
Bivariate
logistic
and
multivariable
models
estimated
the
associations
between
organizational
characteristics
and
relative
preparedness
.
.....
Results
:
A
large
proportion
(
42
%
)
of
respondents
reported
that
less
than
25
additional
fatalities
over
a
48-hour
period
would
exceed
their
response
capacities
.
.....
The
preparedness
constructs
measured
three
related
,
yet
distinct
,
aspects
of
preparedness
,
with
scores
highly
variable
and
generally
suboptimal
.
.....
Median
scores
for
the
three
preparedness
measures
also
varied
across
Federal
Regions
and
as
compared
to
the
number
of
Presidential
Declared
Disasters
,
also
by
Federal
Region
.
.....
Capacity
was
especially
limited
for
activating
missing
persons
call
centers
,
launching
public
communications
,
especially
via
social
media
,
and
identifying
temporary
interment
sites
.
.....
The
provision
of
staff
training
was
the
only
factor
studied
that
was
significantly
(
positively
)
associated
(
p
<
.05
)
with
all
three
preparedness
measures
.
.....
Although
ME/Cs
ranked
local
partners
,
such
as
Offices
of
Emergency
Management
,
first
responders
,
and
funeral
homes
,
as
the
most
important
sources
of
assistance
,
a
sizeable
proportion
(
72
%
)
expected
federal
assistance
.
.....
The
three
measures
of
MFI
preparedness
allowed
for
a
broad
and
comprehensive
assessment
of
preparedness
.
.....
In
the
future
,
these
measures
can
serve
as
useful
benchmarks
or
criteria
for
assessing
ME/Cs
preparedness
.
.....
The
study
findings
suggest
multiple
opportunities
for
improvement
,
including
the
development
and
implementation
of
national
strategies
to
ensure
uniform
standards
for
MFI
management
across
all
jurisdictions

Feline
coronavirus

is
a
complex

that

,
commonly
known
as

(
FIP
)
.
.....
It
is
recognized
that
FCoV
can
occur
in
two
different
serotypes
.
.....
However
,
differences
in
the
S
protein
are
much
more
than
serological
or
antigenic
variants
,
resulting
in
the
effective
presence
of
two
distinct
viruses
.
.....
Here
,
we
review
the
distinct
differences
in
the
S
proteins
of
these
viruses
,
which
are
likely
to
translate
into
distinct
biological
outcomes
.
.....
We
introduce
a
new
concept
related
to
the
non-taxonomical
classification
and
differentiation
among
FCoVs
by
analyzing
and
comparing
the
genetic
,
structural
,
and
functional
characteristics
of
FCoV
and
the
FCoV
S
protein
among
the
two
serotypes
and
FCoV
biotypes
.
.....
Based
on
our
analysis
,
we
suggest
that
our
understanding
of
FIP
needs
to
consider
whether
the
presence
of
these
two
distinct
viruses
has
implications
in
clinical
settings
.

Phosphatidylinositol-3-phosphate
5-kinase
(
PIKfyve
)
is
a
lipid
kinase
involved
in
endosome
maturation
that
emerged
from
a
haploid
genetic
screen
as
being
required
for
Ebola
virus
(
EBOV
)
infection
.
.....
Here
we
analyzed
the
effects
of
apilimod
,
a
PIKfyve
inhibitor
that
was
reported
to
be
well
tolerated
in
humans
in
phase
2
clinical
trials
,
for
its
effects
on
entry
and
infection
of
EBOV
and
Marburg
virus
(
MARV
)
.
.....
We
first
found
that
apilimod
blocks
infections
by
EBOV
and
MARV
in
Huh
7
,
Vero
E6
and
primary
human
macrophage
cells
,
with
notable
potency
in
the
macrophages
(
IC
50
,
10
nM
)
.
.....
We
next
observed
that
similar
doses
of
apilimod
block
EBOV-glycoprotein-virus
like
particle
(
VLP
)
entry
and
transcription-replication
competent
VLP
infection
,
suggesting
that
the
primary
mode
of
action
of
apilimod
is
as
an
entry
inhibitor
,
preventing
release
of
the
viral
genome
into
the
cytoplasm
to
initiate
replication
.
.....
After
providing
evidence
that
the
anti-EBOV
action
of
apilimod
is
via
PIKfyve
,
we
showed
that
it
blocks
trafficking
of
EBOV
VLPs
to
endolysosomes
containing
Niemann-Pick
C1
(
NPC1
)
,
the
intracellular
receptor
for
EBOV
.
.....
Concurrently
apilimod
caused
VLPs
to
accumulate
in
early
endosome
antigen
1-positive
endosomes
.
.....
We
did
not
detect
any
effects
of
apilimod
on
bulk
endosome
acidification
,
on
the
activity
of
cathepsins
B
and
L
,
or
on
cholesterol
export
from
endolysosomes
.
.....
Hence
by
antagonizing
PIKfyve
,
apilimod
appears
to
block
EBOV
trafficking
to
its
site
of
fusion
and
entry
into
the
cytoplasm
.
.....
Given
the
drug
's
observed
anti-filoviral
activity
,
relatively
unexplored
mechanism
of
entry
inhibition
,
and
reported
tolerability
in
humans
,
we
propose
that
apilimod
be
further
explored
as
part
of
a
therapeutic
regimen
to
treat
filoviral
infections

work
shows
that
apilimod
blocks
the
entry
of
EBOV
particles

that
it
does
so

of
entry
,
in
Niemann-Pick
C1-positive
endolysosomes

Our
findings
are
consistent
with
the
identity
of
phosphatidylinositol-3-phosphate
5kinase
as
the
molecular
target
of
apilimod
,

phosphatidylinositol

are
required
for
the
proper
maturation
of

.

Hence
we
propose
that
apilimod
be
further
explored

repositioning
as

of
a
therapeutic
regimen

pandemic
has
allowed
a
refocusing
on
the
global
burden
of
influenza
and
the
importance
of
co-ordinated
international
surveillance

Background
:
The
etiology
of
severe
pneumonia
is
frequently
not
identified
by
routine
disease
surveillance
in
Thailand
.
.....
Since
2010
,
the
Thailand
Ministry
of
Public
Health
(
MOPH
)
and
US
CDC
have
conducted
surveillance
to
detect
known
and
new
etiologies
of
severe
pneumonia
.
.....
Methods
:
Surveillance
for
severe
community-acquired
pneumonia
was
initiated
in
December
2010
among
30
hospitals
in
17
provinces
covering
all
regions
of
Thailand
.

components
of
the

were
created
with
specialized
guidelines
for
each
to
aid
case
investigation
and
notification
.
.....
Severe
pneumonia
was
defined
as
chest-radiograph

pneumonia
of
unknown
etiology
in
a
patient
hospitalized
≤48
h

Conclusions
:
Enhanced
surveillance
improved
the
understanding
of
the

Exhaustion
of
CD8
+
T
cells
and
increased
IL-10
production
is
well-known
in
chronic
viral
infections
but
mechanisms
leading
to
loss
of
their
cytotoxic
capabilities
and
consequent
exhaustion
remain
unclear
.
.....
Exhausted
CD8
+
T
cells
also
called
T
suppressors
are
highly
immune
suppressive
with
altered
T
cell
receptor
signaling
characteristics
that
mark
it
exclusively
from
their
cytotoxic
counterparts
.

Our
study
found
that
iCa
2+
flux
is
reduced
following
T
cell
receptor
activation
in
T
suppressor
cells
when
compared
to
their
effector
counterpart
.
.....
Importantly
chronic
activation
of
murine
cytotoxic
CD8
+
T
cells
lead
to
reduced
iCa
2+
influx
,
decreased
IFN-γ
and
enhanced
IL-10
production
and
this
profile
is
mimicked
in
Tc1
cells
upon
reduction
of
iCa
2+
flux
by
extracellular
calcium
channel
inhibitors
.
.....
Further
reduced
iCa
2+
flux
induced
ROS
which
lead
to
IFN-γ
reduction
and
increased
IL-10
producing
T
suppressors
through
the
STAT3-STAT5
axis
.
.....
The
above
findings
were
substantiated
by
our
human
data
where
reduced
iCa
2+
flux
in
chronic
Hepatitis
infections
displayed
CD8
+
T
cells
with
low
IFN-γ
and
increased
IL-10
production
.
.....
Importantly
treatment
with
an
antioxidant
led
to
increased
IFN-γ
and
reduced
IL-10
production
in
human
chronic
Hep-B/C
samples
suggesting
overall
a
proximal
regulatory
role
for
iCa
2+
influx
,
ROS
,
and
IL-10
in
determining
the
effector/
suppressive
axis
of
CD8

Estimation

crucial
for

In
our
previous
study
,
an
approach
for
estimating
the
basic
reproduction
number
in
real
time
was
developed
.
.....
This
approach
uses
case

the

to
accurately
estimate

available
at
the

Background
:
Severe
fever
with
thrombocytopenia
syndrome
(
SFTS
)
was
an
emerging
hemorrhagic
fever
that
was
caused
by
a
tick-borne
bunyavirus
,
SFTSV
.
.....
Although
SFTSV
nonstructural
protein
can
inhibit
type
I
interferon
(
IFN-I
)
production
Ex
Vivo
and
IFN-I
played
key
role
in
resistance
SFTSV
infection
in
animal
model
,
the
role
of
IFN-I
in
patients
is
not
investigated
.
.....
Methods
:
We
have
assayed
the
concentration
of
IFN-α
,
a
subtype
of
IFN-I
as
well
as
other
cytokines
in
the
sera
of
SFTS
patients
and
the
healthy
population
with
CBA
(
Cytometric
bead
array
)
assay
.
.....
The
results
showed
that
IFN-α
,

(
TNF-α
)
,
granulocyte
colony-stimulating
factor
(

were
significantly
higher
in

patients
than
in
healthy
persons
(

)
;
the
concentrations
of
IFN-α
,
IFN-γ
,
G-CSF
,
MIP-1α
,
IL-6
,
and

were
significant
higher
in
severe
SFTS
patients
than
in
mild
SFTS
patients
(

Conclusion
:
The
concentration
of
IFN-α
as
well
as
other
cytokines
(
IFN-γ
,
G-CSF
,
MIP-1α
,
IL-6
,
and
IP-10
)
is
correlated
with
the
severity
of
SFTS
,
suggesting
that
type
I
interferon
may
not
be
significant
in
resistance

infection
in
humans
and
it
may
play
an
import

Here
,
we
show
that
m336

almost
germline

that
its
IGHV1-69-derived
heavy
chain
provides
more
than
85
%
binding
surface
and
that
its
epitope
almost
completely
overlaps
with
the
receptor-binding
site
.
.....
Analysis
of

an
important
role
of
the

antigen
presenting
cells
(

in
the

thymus
that

with

causing
an
acute

of
T

produces

in
the

cell
repertoire
allowing
for
poor
recognition

.
.....
The

may
be
the
result
of
random
elimination
of

T
cells

the
generation

Since
hypergammaglobulinemia
has
not
been
reported
in
PRRSV-infected
conventionally-reared
piglets
,
we
hypothesize
that
this
is
due

the
down-regulatory
effect

Lack

the

Syndromic
surveillance
uses
health-related
data
that
precedes
diagnosis
.
.....
Although
data
of
this
kind
are
less
specific
than
data
from
confirmed
diagnoses
they
are
typically
more
timely
,
which
is
an
important
consideration
for
real-time
or
near-real-time
analysis
and
interpretation

.
.....
In
veterinary
medicine
the
development
of
systems
for
early
health-event
detection
has
followed
a
similar
path
to
that
previously
taken
in
public
health
5
.
.....
A
recent
inventory
of
current
and
planned
European
veterinary
syndromic
surveillance
systems
showed
wide
interest
in
European
countries
for
syndromic
surveillance
,
but
also
highlighted
the
novelty
of
this
field
6
.
.....
Small
companion
animal
populations
largely
lack
co-ordinated
national
and
international
disease
surveillance
.
.....
This
has
produced
a
deficit
in
our
understanding
of
the
dynamics
and
burden
of
the
full
range
of
endemic/
emerging
diseases
in
companion
animals
and
leaves
these
populations
susceptible
to
the
emergence
of
health
threats
.
.....
Lack
of
disease
surveillance
also
has
implications
for
human
health
,
as
approximately
75
percent
of
new
and
emerging
diseases
are
zoonotic
7
.
.....
However
,
as
health
records
become
digitised
in
veterinary
practices
they
become
more
available
for
research
8
,
providing
an
opportunity
to
improve
companion
animal
syndromic
surveillance
in
clinical
settings
and
the
possibility
of
linking
this
with
human
syndromic
surveillance

Oral

)
has
been
considered
a
promising
approach
for
food
allergies
(
FAs
)
.
.....
However
,
the
current
OIT
strategy
is
limited
in
terms
of
the
long-term
efficacy
and
safety
.
.....
We
have
previously
demonstrated
that
kakkonto
,
a
traditional
Japanese
herbal
medicine
,
suppresses
the
occurrence
of
allergic
symptoms
in
a
murine
model
of
ovalbumin
(
OVA
)
-induced
FA
,
which
is
attributed
to
the
induction
of
the
Foxp3
+
CD4
+
regulatory
T
cells
.
.....
In
this
study
,
we
established
an
OIT
model
using
the
FA
mice
with
already
established
allergic
symptoms
and
determined
whether
kakkonto
could
improve
the
efficacy
of
OIT
.
.....
The
OIT
method
consisted
of
initially
administrating
a
very
small
amount
of
OVA
and
slowly
increasing
the
amount
.
.....
Allergic
symptoms
decreased
in
the
OIT-treated
FA
mice
.
.....
OIT
significantly
downregulated
Th2
immune
response-related
gene
expression
in
the
FA
mouse
colon
,
and
decreased
the
level
of
mouse
mast
cell
protease-1
,
a
marker
of
mast
cell
degranulation
in
the
FA
mouse
plasma
.
.....
Moreover
,
the
concomitant
use
of
kakkonto
significantly
enhanced
the
effectiveness
of
OIT
on
the
allergic
symptoms
,
and
the
combination
therapy
further
suppressed
the
Th2
immune
responses
and
the
mast
cell
degranulation
.
.....
In
addition
,
OIT
significantly
increased
the
population
of
Foxp3
+
CD4
+
regulatory
T
cells
in
the
FA
mouse
colon
,
and
this
population
was
further
increased
by
OIT
in
combination
with
kakkonto
.
.....
Furthermore
,
the
combined
therapy
with
kakkonto
reduced
the
expression
of
RAdegrading
enzyme
CYP26B1
mRNA
in
the
FA
mouse
colon
.
.....
These
findings
indicated
that
the
combination
of
OIT
with
kakkonto
represents
a
promising
approach
for
FA
treatment

Background

documented
in
Hong
Kong
,
and
more
recently
in
Vietnam
,
Thailand

Cambodia
.
.....
We
previously
demonstrated
that
patients
with
H5N1
disease
had
unusually
high
serum
levels
of
IP-10
(
interferon-gamma-inducible
protein-10
)
.
.....
Furthermore
,
when
compared
with
human
influenza
virus
subtype
H1N1
,
the
H5N1
viruses
in
1997
(
A/Hong

)
(
H5N1/97

were
more
potent

)
from
primary

macrophages
in

,
which
suggests
that
cytokines
dysregulation
may
play
a
role
in
pathogenesis
of
H5N1
disease
.
.....
Since
respiratory
epithelial
cells
are
the
primary
target
cell
for
replication
of
influenza

,
it
is
pertinent
to
investigate
the
cytokine
induction
profile
of
H5N1
viruses
in
these
cells
.

We
used
quantitative
RT-PCR

that
in
comparison
to
human
H1N1
viruses
,
H5N1/97

viruses
were
more
potent
inducers

.
.....
Recent
H5N1
viruses
from
Vietnam
(
H5N1/04

appeared
to
be
even
more
potent
at
inducing

The
frequent
occurrence

rabies
cases

To
determine

actually
contribute

rabies
cases
,
and
the
possible
origin
of
the
ferret
badger-associated
rabies
in
the
region
,
an
active
rabies
survey
was
conducted
to
determine
the
frequency
of
rabies
infection
and
seroprevalence
in
dogs
and
ferret
badgers
.
.....
Methods
:
A
retrospective
survey
on
rabies
epidemics
was
performed
in
Zhejiang
,
Jiangxi
and
Anhui
provinces
in
southeast
China
.
.....
The
brain
tissues
from
ferret
badgers
and
dogs
were
assayed
by
fluorescent
antibody
test
.
.....
Rabies
virus
was
isolated
and
sequenced
for
phylogenetic
analysis
.
.....
The
sera
from
ferret
badgers
and
dogs
were
titrated
using
rabies
virus
neutralizing
antibodies
(
VNA
)
test
.
.....
The
ferret
badgers
presented
a
higher
percentage
of
rabies
seroconversion
than
dogs
did
in
the
endemic
region
,
reaching
a
maximum
of
95
%
in
the
collected
samples
.
.....
Nine
ferret
badger-associated
rabies
viruses
were
isolated
,
sequenced
,
and
were
phylogenetically
clustered
as
a
separate
group
.
.....
Nucleotide
sequence
revealed
99.4-99.8
%
homology
within
the
ferret
badger
isolates
,
and
83-89
%
homology
to
the
dog
isolates
in
the
nucleoprotein
and
glycoprotein
genes
in
the
same
rabies
endemic
regions
.
.....
Conclusions
:
Our
data
suggest
ferret
badger-associated
rabies
has
likely
formed
as
an
independent
enzootic
originating
from
dogs
during
the
long-term
rabies
infestation
in
southeast
China
.

The
eventual
role
of
FB
rabies
in
public
health
remains
unclear
.

However
,
management
of
ferret
badger
bites
,
rabies
awareness
and
control
in
the
related
regions
should
be
an
immediate

broad
inhibitory
activity
against

an
important
and

The
effective

Summary
:
In
this
manuscript
,
the
authors
use
transcriptomics
and
lipidomics
of
MERS-CoV
infected
cells
to
identify
alterations
in
cellular
lipid
metabolism
.
.....
They
then
screen
a
bioactive
lipid
library
and
identify
a
lipid
(
AM850
)
that
has
broad
spectrum
antiviral
activity
in
vitro
and
in
vivo
.
.....
Characterization
of
this
compound
suggests
that
it
targets
nSREBP
,
a
common
node
of
viral
infection
.
.....
Docking
and
binding
studies
lend
support
for
the
AM850-SREBP
interaction
.
.....
This
impacts
lipid
biosynthesis
,
and
they
show
a
role
for
inhibition
of
fatty
acid
synthesis
(
FAS
)
in
particular
.
.....
I
am
generally
supportive
of
this
manuscript
.

Although
the
SREBP/FAS
pathways
have
been
implicated
as
both
virally
manipulated
and
a
broad-spectrum
drug
target
in
previous
studies
,
the
identification
of
a
bioactive
lipid
inhibitor
with
efficacy
in
vitro
and
in
vivo
plus
a
good
selectivity
index
is
quite
interesting
.

Some
experiments
lack
controls
and
many
are
over-interpreted

needs

As
mentioned
above
,
many
studies
have
identified
SREBP/FAS
as
virally
manipulated
and
that
inhibiting
them
inhibits
viral
replication
(
including
some
of
the
viruses
in
this
study
such
as
IAV
and
flaviviruses
)

should
be

Remarks
to
the
Author
)
:
.....
Glycans
are
multi-branched
sugars
that
are
displayed
from
lipids
and
proteins
.
.....
Through
their
diverse
polysaccharide
structures
they
can
potentiate
a
myriad
of
cellular
signaling
pathways
involved
in
development
,
growth
,
immuno-communication
and
survival
.
.....
Not
surprisingly
,
disruption
of
glycan
synthesis
is
fundamental
to
various
human
diseases
;
including
cancer
,
where
aberrant
glycosylation
drives
malignancy
.
.....
Here
,
we
report
the
discovery
of
a
novel
mannose-binding
lectin
,
ML6
,
which
selectively
recognizes
and
binds
to
these
irregular
tumor-specific
glycans
to
elicit
potent
and
rapid
cancer
cell
death
.
.....
This
lectin
was
engineered
from
gene
models
identified
in
a
tropical
rainforest
tree
root
transcriptome
and
is
unusual
in
its
six
canonical
mannose
binding
domains
(
QxDxNxVxY
)
,
each
with
a
unique
amino
acid
sequence
.
.....
Remarkably
,
ML6
displays
antitumor
activity
that
is
>
10
5
times
more
potent
than
standard
chemotherapeutics
,
while
being
almost
completely
inactive
towards
non-transformed
,
healthy
cells
.
.....
This
activity
,
in
combination
with
results
from
glycan
binding
studies
,
suggests
ML6
differentiates
healthy
and
malignant
cells
by
exploiting
divergent
glycosylation
pathways
that
yield
naïve
and
incomplete
cell
surface
glycans
in
tumors
.
.....
Thus
,
ML6
and
other
high-valence
lectins
may
serve
as
novel
biochemical
tools
to
elucidate
the
glycomic
signature
of
different
human
tumors
and
aid
in
the
rational
design
of
carbohydratedirected
therapies
.
.....
Further
,
understanding
how
nature
evolves
proteins
,
like
ML6
,
to
combat
the
changing
defenses
of
competing
microorganisms
may
allow
for
fundamental
advances
in
the
way
we
approach
combinatorial
therapies
to
fight
therapeutic
resistance
in
cancer

In
this

,
using
next-generation

,
an
NDV
was
identified
and
isolated
from
Vero
cells
inoculated
with
the
nasal
swab
of
an
aborted
dromedary
fetus
in
Dubai
,
during
the
time
when
an
NDV
outbreak
occurred
in
a
pigeon
farm
located
in
close
proximity
to
the
dairy
camel
farm
where
the
mother
of
the
aborted
dromedary
fetus
resided
,
and
there
were
a
lot
of
pigeons
in
the
camel
farm
.
.....
Genome
analysis
revealed
that
the
structurally
and
functionally
important
features
of
other
NDVs
were
also
present
in
this
dromedary
NDV
genome
.

that
the

belonged

is
most
closely

The

is
the
first
that
demonstrated
isolation
of
NDV
in

Background
:
Multiplex
real-time
polymerase
chain
reaction
assays
have
improved
diagnostic
sensitivity
for
a
wide
range
of
pathogens
.
.....
However
,
co-detection
of
multiple
agents
and
bacterial
colonization
make
it
difficult
to
distinguish
between
asymptomatic
infection
or
illness
aetiology
.
.....
We
assessed
whether
semi-quantitative
microbial
load
data
can
differentiate
between
symptomatic
and
asymptomatic
states
for
common
respiratory
pathogens
.
.....
Methods
:
We
obtained
throat
and
nasal
swab
samples
from
military
trainees
at
two
Thai
Army
barracks
.
.....
Specimens
were
collected
at
the
start
and
end
of
10-week
training
periods
(
non-acute
samples
)
,
and
from
individuals
who
developed
upper
respiratory
tract
infection
during
training
(
acute
samples
)
.

We
analysed
the
samples
using
a
commercial
multiplex
respiratory
panel
comprising
33
bacterial
,
viral
and
fungal
targets

We
used

We
analysed

145
acute

Haemophilus

was
the
most
commonly

(
77.4
%
of

In
acute
samples
,
nine
specific
microbe
pairs
were
detected
more
frequently
than
expected
by
chance
.

Regression
models
indicated
significantly
lower
microbial
load
in

relative
to
acute
samples
for
H.
influenzae
non-type
B
,
Streptococcus

,
although
it
was
not
possible
to
identify
a
Ct-value
threshold
indicating
causal
etiology
for
any
of
these
organisms
.

Conclusions
:
Semi-quantitative
measures
of
microbial
concentration
did
not
reliably
differentiate
between
illness
and
asymptomatic
colonization
,
suggesting
that
clinical
symptoms
may
not
always
be
directly
related
to
microbial
load
for
common
respiratory
infections
.

Background
:
In
many
studies
,
some
information
might
not
be
available
for
the
whole
cohort
,
some
covariates
,
or
even
the
outcome
,
might
be
ascertained
in

These

are
part
of
a
broad
category
termed
two-phase

.

Common
examples
include
the
nested

and
the

.

For
two-phase
studies
,
appropriate
weighted

estimates
have
been
derived
;
however
,
no
estimator
of
cumulative
incidence
accounting
for
competing
events
has
been
proposed
.

This
is
relevant
in
the

of
multiple
types
of
events
,
where
estimation
of

type
specific
quantities
are
needed
for
evaluating

Methods
:
We
develop
a

estimator
of
the
cumulative
incidence
function
of
events
accounting
for
possible

It
handles
a

The
proposed
method
shows
good
performance

It
is
applied
to

the

in
a

of
nearly
2000

,
where
death
due
to
toxicity
acted
as
a
competing
event
.

In
a
second
example
the
aim
was
to
estimate
engagement
in
care
of
a
cohort
of
HIV
patients
in
resource
limited
setting
,
where
for
some
patients
the
outcome
itself
was
missing
due
to
lost

A
sampling
based
approach
was
used
to
identify
outcome
in
a

of
lost
patients
and
to
obtain
a
valid
estimate
of

Conclusions
:
A
valid
estimator
for

Background
:
The
outcome
of
a
viral
infection
is
regulated
by
complex
interactions
of
viral
and
host
factors
.
.....
SARS
coronavirus
(
SARS-CoV
)
engages
and
regulates
several
innate
immune
response
pathways
during
infection
.
.....
We
have
previously
shown
that
the
SARS-CoV
Papain-like
Protease
(
PLpro
)
inhibits
type
I
interferon
(
IFN
)
by
inhibiting
IRF3
phosphorylation
thereby
blocking
downstream
Interferon
induction
.
.....
This
finding
prompted
us
to
identify
other
potential
mechanisms
of
inhibition
of
PLpro
on
IFN
induction
.
.....
Methods
:
We
have
used
plasmids
expressing
PLpro
and
IRF3
including
an
IRF3
mutant
that
is
constitutively
active
,
called
IRF3
(
5D
)
.
.....
In
these
experiments
we
utilize
transfections
,
chromatin
immunoprecipitation
,
Electro-mobility
Shift
Assays
(
EMSA
)
and
protein
localization
to
identify
where
IRF3
and
IRF3
(
5D
)
are
inhibited
by
PLpro
.
.....
Results
:
Here
we
show
that
PLpro
also
inhibits
IRF3
activation
at
a
step
after
phosphorylation
and
that
this
inhibition
is
dependent
on
the
de-ubiquitination
(
DUB
)
activity
of
PLpro
.
.....
We
found
that
PLpro
is
able
to
block
the
type
I
IFN
induction
of
a
constitutively
active
IRF3
,
but
does
not
inhibit
IRF3
dimerization
,
nuclear
localization
or
DNA
binding
.
.....
However
,
inhibition
of
PLpro
's
DUB
activity
by
mutagenesis
blocked
the
IRF3
inhibition
activity
of
PLpro
,
suggesting
a
role
for
IRF3
ubiquitination
in
induction
of
a
type
I
IFN
innate
immune
response
.
.....
Conclusion
:
These
results
demonstrate
an
additional
mechanism
that
PLpro
is
able
to
inhibit
IRF3
signaling
.
.....
These
data
suggest
novel
innate
immune
antagonism
activities
of
PLpro
that
may
contribute
to
SARS-CoV
pathogenesis

in
both
weanling
mice
and
rhesus
monkeys
.
.....
Following
intraperitoneal
inoculation
of
mice
,
LACV
replicated
in
various
organs
before
reaching
the
CNS
where
it
replicates
to
high
titer
causing
death
from
neurological
disease
.
.....
The
peripheral
site
where
LACV
replicates
to
highest
titer
is
the
nasal
turbinates
,
and
,
presumably
,
LACV
can
enter
the
CNS
via
the
olfactory
neurons
from
nasal
olfactory
epithelium
.
.....
The
mouse
infectious
dose
50
and
lethal
dose
50
was
similar
for
LACV
administered
either
intranasally
or
intraperitoneally
.
.....
LACV
was
highly
infectious
for
rhesus
monkeys
and
infected
100
%
of
the
animals
at
10
PFU
.
.....
However
,
the
infection
was
asymptomatic
,
and
the
monkeys
developed
a
strong
neutralizing
antibody
response
.
.....
In
mice
,
LACV
likely
gains
access
to
the
CNS
via
the
blood
stream
or
via
olfactory
neurons
.
.....
The
ability
to
efficiently
infect
mice
intranasally
raises
the
possibility
that
LACV
might
use
this
route
to
infect
its
natural
hosts
.
.....
Rhesus
monkeys
are
susceptible
to
LACV
infection
and
develop
strong
neutralizing
antibody
responses
after
inoculation
with
as
little
as
10
PFU
.
.....
Mice
and
rhesus
monkeys
are
useful
animal
models
for
LACV
vaccine
immunologic
testing
although
the
rhesus
monkey
model
is
not
optimal
.

Background
:
HIV/AIDS
is
one
of
the
most
stigmatized
medical
conditions
across
the
world
.
.....
Self-stigma
is
prevalent
among
people
living
with
HIV
(
PLHIV
)
and
a
major
obstacle
to
HIV
prevention
and
care
.
.....
Objective
:
This
study
aimed
to
describe
the
experiences
of
stigmatization
and
explore
the
possible
factors
that
might
be
associated
with
stigmatization
among
PLHIV
in
Hong
Kong
.
.....
Design
:
Qualitative
in-depth
interviews
were
conducted
.
.....
Setting
and
participants
:
15
PLHIV
were
recruited
from
two
local
non-governmental
organizations
on
HIV
prevention
.
.....
Participants
were
interviewed
about
their
views
and
feelings
towards
oneself
as
a
PLHIV
and
contributing
factors
,
experiences
of
discriminations
,
stigmatizing
behaviours
,
issues
about
disclosure
,
social
relationships
and
potential
impact
of
HIV
.
.....
Thematic
analyses
revealed
three
levels
of
factors
which
might
be
associated
with
stigmatization
:
(
i
)
intrapersonal
level
(
misconceptions
about
HIV
,
attribution
of
self-responsibility
,
severe
state
of
illness
,
side-effects
of
medication
)
,
(
ii
)
interpersonal
level
(
discrimination
,
social
rejection
)
and
(
iii
)
social
level
(
mass
media
,
public
stereotypes
)
.
.....
Findings
provide
important
insights

Background
:
Influenza
is
a
major
public
health
issue
worldwide
.
.....
It
is
characterized
by
episodes
of
infection
that
involve
hundreds
of
millions
of
people
each
year
.

Since
that
in
the
seasons
2010-2011
and
2011-2012
the
circulation
of
FLUB
was
decreasing
we
evaluated
the
clinical
presentation
,
demographic
characteristics
,
admitting
department
,
and
length
of
stay
in
children
who
contracted
influenza
admitted
to
Bambino
Gesù
Children
's
Hospital
,
during
the
2012-2013
influenza
season
,
with
the
aim
to
establish
if
the
recover
of
FLUB
was
associated
to
a
clinical
worsening
,
in
comparison
with
those
due
to
FLUA
.
.....
Methods
:
A
total
of
133
respiratory
specimens
,
collected
from
patients
with
symptoms
of
respiratory
tract
infections
,
positive
for
the
Influenza
A
and
B
viruses
(
FLUA
and
B
)
were
subtyped
.
.....
Comparisons
between
the
FLUA
and
FLUB
groups
were
performed
with
the
one-way
ANOVA
for
continuous
parametric
variables
,
the
Mann-Whitney
test
for
non-parametric
variables
,
or
the
Chi-Square
test
or
Fisher
's
exact
test
(
if
cells
<
5
)
for
categorical
variables
.
.....
Results
:
87.09
%
of
the
FLUA
isolates
were
the
H1N1
subtype
and
12.90
%
were
H3N2
.
.....
Among
the
FLUB
isolates
,
91.54
%
were
the
B/Yamagata/16/88
lineage
and
8.45
%
were
the
B/Victoria/02/87
lineage
.
.....
The
largest
number
of
FLUA/H1N1
cases
was
observed
in
children
less
than
1
years
old
,
while
the
B/Yamagata/16/88
lineage
was
most
prevalent
in
children
3-6
years
old
.
.....
Fever
was
a
common
symptom
for
both
FLUA
and
B
affected
patients
.
.....
However
,
respiratory
symptoms
were
more
prevalent
in
patients
affected
by
FLUA
.
.....
The
median
length
of
stay
in
the
hospital
was
5
days
for
FLUA
and
3
days
for
FLUB
.
.....
Conclusions
:
The
clinical
features
correlated
to
different
Influenza
viruses
,
and
relevant
subtypes
,
were
evaluated
concluding
that
the
increasing
of
FLUB
in
the
season
2012-2013
was
without
any
dramatic
change
in
clinical
manifestation
.
.....
Our
findings
suggest
,
finally
,
that
a
stronger
commitment
to
managing
patients
affected
by
FLUA
is
required
,
as
the
disease
is
more
severe
than
FLUB
.

Metagenomics
is
currently
the
only
generic
method
for
pathogen
detection
.

Starting
from

allows
the
assessment
of
the
whole

Here
we
present
our
modular
concerted
protocol
for
sample
processing
for
diagnostic
metagenomics
analysis
of
human
,
animal
,
and

samples
.

The
workflow
does
not
rely
on
dedicated
amplification
steps
at
any
stage
in
the
process
and
,
in
contrast
to
published
methods
,
libraries
prepared
accordingly
will
yield
only
minute
amounts
of
unclassifiable
reads
.
.....
We
confirmed
the
performance
of
the
approach
using
a
spectrum
of
pathogen/
matrix-combinations
showing
it
has
the
potential
to
become
a
commonly
usable
analytical
framework
.
.....
Diagnostic
metagenomics
with
high-throughput
sequencing
(

techniques
continuously
gains
importance
for
broad
and
swift
identification
of
pathogens
in
human
,
animal
,
and
food
samples
1
.
.....
While
for
known
pathogens
,
highly
sensitive
and
specific
diagnostic
methods
like
real-time
quantitative
PCR
(
qPCR
)
are
in
routine
use
and
deliver
reliable
results
,
the
identification
of
unrecognized
pathogens
,
meaning
unexpected
or
newly
emerging
pathogens
or
pathogens
that
are
only
distantly
related
with
known
ones
,
can
be
very
difficult
.
.....
In
this
respect
,
metagenomics
using
HTS
are
much
more
promising
than
routine
diagnostics
.
.....
Unrecognized
pathogens
,
especially
newly
emerging
zoonoses
,
may
cause
serious
infectious
diseases
,
and
a
delay
of
medical
treatment
or
development
of
vaccines
might
have
fatal
consequences
for
the
affected
patients
and
animal
stocks
.
.....
Such
delays
can
be
caused
by
performing
numerous
laborious
screening
tests
until
the
potential
pathogen
is
found
instead
of
a
single
comprehensive
screening
test
.
.....
Prominent
cases
of
emerging
infectious
diseases
caused
by
novel
or
varying
viruses
for
instance
are
the
discovery
of
the
Middle
East
respiratory
syndrome
(
MERS
)
coronavirus
in
2012
2
,
the
tremendous
Ebola
outbreak
in
2014
3
,
the
report
on
a
novel
zoonotic
bornavirus

,
or
the
detection
of
the
new
Schmallenberg
virus
5
affecting
domestic
and
wild
ruminants
.
.....
However
,
infectious
diseases
with
clinical
signs
like
high
fever
,
diarrhoea
,
or
encephalitis
−
often
life-threatening
−
can
be
caused
by
very
different
infectious
agents
6,7
,
not
only
viruses
.
.....
In
such
puzzling
cases
,
a
generic
approach
that
works
likewise
successful
and
efficient
for
all
pathogen
groups
,
as
sketched
in
Fig
.
.....
1
,
is
essential
.
.....
In
a
number
of
review
articles
1,8-12
,
valuable
considerations
for
this
approach
have
been
summarized
.
.....
In
addition
to
the
overall
workflow
outlined
in
Fig
.
.....
1
,
after
metagenomic
analysis
,
it
is
desirable
to
confirm
the
initial
sequencing-based
suspicion
by
other
methods
and
in
the
ideal
case
by
fulfilling
the
Henle-Loeffler-Koch
postulates
13
as
for
example
done
in
case
of
the
Schmallenberg
virus

.
.....
Metagenomics
for
generic
pathogen
detection
,
so-called
diagnostic
metagenomics
,
in
its
pure
form
is
a
broad
and
undirected
approach
to
find
gene
sequences
or
sequence
fragments
of
infectious
agents
within
sequence
data
sets
of
the
whole
community
of
a
sample
generated
by
high-throughput
sequencing
.
.....
A
crucial
point
when
handling
diagnostic
sequencing
approaches
is
to
explicitly
distinguish
between
i
)
high-throughput
well-standardisable
routine
diagnostics
for
expected
known
pathogens
and
ii
)
diagnostic
metagenomics
for
all
including
unrecognized
pathogens
.
.....
The
first
approach
is
easier
to
design
based
on
the
spectrum
of
known
sequences
,
testing
with
specific
oligonucleotide
primers
for
pathogens
of
known
identity
14,15
,
known
tropism
,
and
maybe
also
of
a
known
proportion
within
a
sample
.
.....
The
latter
one
−
used
for
unrecognized
pathogens
like
in
the
case
of
Schmallenberg
virus
5
−
should
be
a
generic
approach
that
can
ideally
be
applied
to
all
samples
and
pathogens
.
.....
This
approach
can
indeed
be
developed
and
tested
using
samples
of
known
origin
and
pathogen
content
.
.....
In
case
of
an
emergency
,
however
,
there
might
be
no
information
about
nature
and
proportion
of
the
pathogen
and
only
clinical
data
could
be
available
,
and
the
sample
is
a
closed
book

The
outbreaks
of
the
severe
acute

epidemic
in
2003
resulted
in
unprecedented
impacts
on
people
's
daily
life
.
.....
One
of
the
most
significant
impacts
to
people
is
the
fear
of
contacting
the
SARS
virus
while
engaging
daily
routine
activity
.
.....
Here
we
use
data
from
daily
underground
ridership
in
Taipei
City
and
daily
reported
new
SARS
cases
in
Taiwan
to
model
the
dynamics
of
the
public
fear
of
the
SARS
virus
during
the
wax
and
wane
of
the
SARS
period
.
.....
We
found
that
for
each
reported
new
SARS
case
there
is
an
immediate
loss
of
about
1200
underground
ridership
(
the
fresh
fear
)
.
.....
These
daily
loss
rates
dissipate
to
the
following
days
with
an
e-folding
time
of
about
28
days
,
reflecting
the
public
perception
on
the
risk
of
contacting
SARS
virus
when
traveling
with
the
underground
system
(
the
residual
fear
)
.
.....
About
50
%
of
daily
ridership
was
lost
during
the
peak
of
the
2003
SARS
period
,
compared
with
the
loss
of
80
%
daily
ridership
during
the
closure
of
the
underground
system
after
Typhoon
Nari
,
the
loss
of
50-70
%
ridership
due
to
the
closure
of
the
governmental
offices

Despite
flaviviruses
remaining
the
leading
cause
of
systemic
human
infections
worldwide
,
ocular
manifestations
of
these
mosquito-transmitted
viruses
are
considered
relatively
uncommon
in
part
due
to
under-reporting
.
.....
However
,
recent
outbreaks
of
Zika
virus
(
ZIKV
)
implicated
in
causing
multiple
ocular
abnormalities
,
such
as
conjunctivitis
,
retinal
hemorrhages
,
chorioretinal
atrophy
,
posterior
uveitis
,
optic
neuritis
,
and
maculopathies
,
has
rejuvenated
a
significant
interest
in
understanding
the
pathogenesis
of
flaviviruses
,
including
ZIKV
,
in
the
eye
.
.....
In
this
review
,
first
,
we
summarize
the
current
knowledge
of
the
major
flaviviruses
(
Dengue
,
West
Nile
,
Yellow
Fever
,
and
Japanese
Encephalitis
)
reported
to
cause
ocular
manifestations
in
humans
with
emphasis
on
recent
ZIKV
outbreaks
.
.....
Second
,
being
an
immune
privilege
organ
,
the
eye
is
protected
from
systemic
infections
by
the
presence
of
blood-retinal
barriers
(
BRB
)
.
.....
Hence
,
we
discuss
how
flaviviruses
modulate
retinal
innate
response
and
breach
the
protective
BRB
to
cause
ocular
or
retinal
pathology
.
.....
Finally
,
we
describe
recently
identified
infection
signatures
of
ZIKV
and
discuss
whether
these
system
biology-predicted
genes
or
signaling
pathways
(
e.g.
,
cellular
metabolism
)
could
contribute
to
the
pathogenesis
of
ocular
manifestations
and
assist
in
the
development
of
ocular
antiviral
therapies
against
ZIKV
and
other
flaviviruses
.

In
recent
years
,
there
has
been
an
increasing
appreciation
of

is
a
highly
abundant
intermediate
filament
protein
,
and
its
intracellular
functions
have
been
investigated
in
a
large
number
of
studies
.
.....
Recently
,
however
,
vimentin
has
been
shown
to
take
part
in
significant
processes
outside
the
cell
.
.....
Our
understanding
of
the
functions
of
extracellular
vimentin
is
,
however
,
limited
.
.....
In
this
study
we
demonstrate
that
a
vimentin
specific
antibody
,
obtained
by
phage
antibody
technology
,
promotes
tube
formation
of
endothelial
cells
in
a
2D
matrigel
assay
.
.....
By
binding
vimentin
,
the
antibody
increases
the
tube
formation
by
21
%
after
5
hours
of
incubation
.
.....
Addition
of
the
antibody
directly
to
cultured
endothelial
cells
does
not
influence
endothelial
cell
migration
or
proliferation
.
.....
The
enhanced
tube
formation
can
be
seen
for
up
to
10
hours
where
after
the
effect
decreases
.
.....
It
is
shown
that
the
antibody-binding
site
is
located
on
the
coil
2
domain
of
vimentin
.
.....
To
our
knowledge
this
is
the
first
study
that
demonstrates
an
enhanced
tube
formation
by
binding
vimentin
in
a
2D
matrigel
assay
under
normoxic
conditions
.
.....
The
intermediate
filament
protein
vimentin
exert
important
intracellular
functions
,
regulating
processes
like
cell
migration
and
sustaining
cell
integrity
.
.....
The
importance
of
vimentin-mediated
processes
was
underestimated
for
years
,
mainly
because
vimentin
deficient
(
vim
−/−
)
mice
initially
were
described
as
displaying
virtually
normal
phenotypes
and
no
apparent
physiological
defects
were
observed
1
.
.....
Eventually
,
more
detailed
studies
on
vim
−/−
mice
revealed
that
vimentin
has
key
functions
in
events
of
cell
signalling
,
migration
and
adhesion
2
,
3
.
.....
The
57
kDa
type
III
intermediate
filament
protein
,
consists
of
a
head-
,
rod-and
tail
domain
and
can
be
post-translationally
modified
.
.....
A
large
number
of
phosphorylation
sites
have
been
characterised
,
especially
on
the
head
domain
where
the
phosphorylation
status
regulate
filament
assembly
4
,
5
.
.....
Deamination
of
arginine
residues
in
the
head
domain
leads
to
citrullination
,
which
may
be
important
in
inflammatory
diseases
such
as
rheumatoid
arthritis
6
.
.....
Vimentin
may
be
further
modified
by
addition
of
N-Acetylglucosamine
or
act
as
a
specific
target
for
glycation
7-9
.
.....
In
addition
,
proteolytic
cleavage
by
specific
caspases
and
calpain
further
modify
vimentin
10
,
11
.
.....
Apart
from
the
influence
of
post-translational
modification
on
filament
assembly
,
the
functional
effects
of
modification
still
remain
largely
unknown
.
.....
Possibly
due
to
the
high
intracellular
abundance
of
vimentin
,
the
extracellular
localisation
and
possible
functions
has
only
been
described
in
the
last
15
years
.
.....
Initially
,
vimentin
was
found
on
the
surface
of
activated
macrophages
,
but
more
recently
it
has
been
found
on
the
surface
of
more
cells
including
circulating
tumour
cells
12-14
.
.....
How
the
vimentin-mediated
processes
are
regulated
remains
elusive
,
and
it
seems
that
vimentin
is
a
highly
dynamic
molecule
with
tissue
specific
functions
15-17
.
.....
Vimentin
has
been
shown
to
take
part
in
viral
and
bacterial
infections
and
may
be
a
key
partner
in
neuronal
regeneration
[

[
19
]
[
20
]
[
21
]
.
.....
It
has
been
suggested
that
vimentin
may
serve
as
a
potential
anti-angiogenic
target
,
however
,
results
are
contradicting
22-24
.
.....
As
angiogenesis
is
an
essential
part
of
sustaining
oxygen
supply
in
health
as
well
as
in
disease
,
potential
anti-angiogenic
targets
have
to
be
carefully
evaluated
to
avoid
severe
adverse
effects
by
the
anti-angiogenic
treatment

.

The
ability
to
form
new
blood
vessels
is
diminished
with
age
.
.....
To
increase
our
cellular
and
biochemical
understanding
of
this
age
related
decline
in
angiogenesis
,
we
have
previously
established
long-term

of
endothelial

We
established

,
indicating
that
the
CDI
animal
model
was
established
in
hamster
.
.....
Of
the
3
immunization
groups
,
secreted-protein
and
membrane-anchored
plasmid
groups
had
significantly
lower
mortalities
,
body

,
and
pathological
scores
,
with
higher
survival
rate/time

The
tilter
of
IgG
antibody
directed
against

was
significantly
higher
in
serum

while
the
corresponding
titer
of

had
no
substantial
differences
(

.
.....
The
anti-TcdA
serum
of
membrane-anchored

neutralized
the

The
incidences
of
TcdA-induced
death
and
apoptosis
of
intestinal

were
significantly
reduced
by
cell
pre-incubation

treatment
with
anti-TcdA
serum
of

were
the
lowest
in

compared
to
the

Conclusion
:
Recombinant
L.
lactis
live
vaccine
is
effective
for
preventing
CDI
in
the
hamster
model
,
thus
providing

The
choice
of
an
appropriate
housekeeping
gene
for
normalisation
purposes
has
now
become
an
essential
requirement
when
designing
QPCR
experiments
.
.....
This
is
of
particular
importance
when
using
QPCR
to
measure
viral
and
cellular
gene
transcription
levels
in
the
context
of
viral
infections
as
viruses
can
significantly
interfere
with
host
cell
pathways
,
the
components
of
which
traditional
housekeeping
genes
often
encode
.
.....
In
this
study
we
have
determined
the
reliability
of
10
housekeeping
genes
in
context
of
four
heavily
studied
viral
infections
;
human

varicella
zoster
virus
infections
using
a
variety
of
cell
types
and
virus
strains
.
.....
This
provides
researchers
of
these
viruses
with
a
shortlist
of
potential
housekeeping
genes
to
use
as
normalisers
for
QPCR
experiments
.

The
large

operations
and
dense

emerging
viruses
.

Background
:
Salmonid
fishes
are
among
the
most
widely
studied
model
fish
species
but
reports
on
systematic
evaluation
of
reference
genes
in
qRT-PCR
studies
is
lacking
.
.....
The
stability
of
six
potential
reference
genes
was
examined
in
eight
tissues
of
Atlantic
salmon
(
Salmo
salar
)
,
to
determine
the
most
suitable
genes
to
be
used
in
quantitative
real-time
RT-PCR
analyses
.

The

two
paralog
genes
encoding
elongation

,
in
addition
to
a
group
of
individuals
that
went
through
smoltification
.

Based
on
calculations
performed
with
the
geNorm
VBA
applet
,
which
determines
the
most
stable
genes
from
a
set
of
tested

in
a
given
cDNA
sample
,
the
ranking
of
the
examined

When
the
same
calculations
were
done
on
a
total
of
24
individuals
from
four
stages
in
the
smoltification
process
(
presmolt
,
smolt
,
smoltified

,
the

>
EF1A
A
>
S20
>
β-actin
>
18S
rRNA
>
GAPDH
.
.....
Overall
,
this
work
suggests
that
the
EF1A
A
and
EF1A
B
genes
can
be
useful
as
reference
genes
in
qRT-PCR
examination
of
gene
expression
in
the

Background
:
Estimates
of
parameters
for
disease
transmission
in
large-scale
infectious
disease
outbreaks
are
often
obtained
to
represent
large
groups
of
people
,
providing
an
average
over
a
potentially
very
diverse
area
.
.....
For
control
measures
to
be
more
effective
,
a
measure
of
the
heterogeneity
of
the
parameters
is
desirable
.
.....
Methods
:
We
propose
a
novel
extension
of
a
network-based
approach
to
estimating
the
reproductive
number
.
.....
With
this
we
can
incorporate
spatial
and/or
demographic
information
through
a
similarity
matrix
.
.....
We
apply
this
to
the
2009
Influenza
pandemic
in
South
Africa
to
understand
the
spatial
variability
across
provinces
.
.....
We
explore
the
use
of
five
similarity
matrices
to
illustrate
their
impact
on
the
subsequent
epidemic
parameter
estimates
.
.....
Results
:
When
treating
South
Africa
as
a
single
entity
with
homogeneous
transmission
characteristics
across
the
country
,
the
basic
reproductive
number
,
R
0
,
(
and
imputation
range
)
is
1.33
(
1.31
,
1.36
)
.
.....
When
fitting
a
new
model
for
each
province
with
no
inter-province
connections
this
estimate
varies
little
(
1.23-1.37
)
.
.....
Using
the
proposed
method
with
any
of
the
four
similarity
measures
yields
an
overall
R
0
that
varies
little
across
the
four
new
models
(
1.33
to
1.34
)
.
.....
However
,
when
allowed
to
vary
across
provinces
,
the
estimated
R
0
is
greater
than
one
consistently
in
only
two
of
the
nine
provinces
,
the
most
densely
populated
provinces
of
Gauteng
and
Western
Cape
.
.....
Conclusions
:
Our
results
suggest
that
the
spatial
heterogeneity
of
influenza
transmission
was
compelling
in
South
Africa
during
the
2009
pandemic
.
.....
This
variability
makes
a
qualitative
difference
in
our
understanding
of
the
epidemic
.
.....
While
the
cause
of
this
fluctuation
might
be
partially
due
to
reporting
differences
,
there
is
substantial
evidence
to
warrant
further
investigation
.
.....
As
a
leading
global
city
with
a
high
population
density
,
Singapore
is
at
risk
for
the
introduction
of
novel
biological
threats
.
.....
This
risk
has
been
recently
reinforced
by
human
epidemics
in
Singapore
of
SARS
coronavirus
,
2009
pandemic
H1N1
influenza
A
virus
,

Other
major
threats
to
Singapore
include
MERS-coronavirus
and
various
avian
and
swine
influenza
viruses
.
.....
The
ability
to
quickly
identify
and
robustly
track
such
threats
to
initiate
an
early
emergency
response
remains
a
significant
challenge
.

In
an
effort

The
Hom-1
vesivirus
was
reported
in

calicivirus
San
Miguel
sea
lion
virus
to
a
human
host
in
a
laboratory
.

We
characterized
the
Hom-1
strain
and
investigated
the
mechanism
by
which
human
cells
could
be
infected
.
.....
An
expression
library
of
3,559
human
plasma
membrane
proteins
was
screened
for
reactivity
with
Hom-1

a
single
interacting
protein
,
human
junctional
adhesion
molecule

,
was
identified

conferred
susceptibility
to
Hom-1
infection
on
nonpermissive
Chinese
hamster
ovary
(

Virus
infection
was
markedly
inhibited
when
CHO
cells
stably
expressing
hJAM
were
pretreated
with
anti-hJAM1
monoclonal
antibodies
.

Cell
lines
of
human
origin
were
tested
for
growth
of
Hom-1

efficient
replication
was
observed
in
HepG2

The
three
cell
lines
(
of
hepatic

intestinal
origin
)
were
confirmed
to
express
hJAM1
on

clustered
regularly
interspaced
short
palindromic
repeats/Cas9-mediated
knockout
of
the
hJAM1
gene
in

Taken
together
,
our
data
indicate
that
entry
of
the
Hom-1
vesivirus
into
these
permissive
human

We
introduce
here
a
mathematical
procedure
for
the
structural
classification
of
a
specific
class
of
self-assembling
protein
nanoparticles
(
SAPNs
)
that
are
used
as
a
platform
for
repetitive
antigen
display
systems
.
.....
These
SAPNs
have
distinctive
geometries
as
a
consequence
of
the
fact
that
their
peptide
building
blocks
are
formed
from
two
linked
coiled
coils
that
are
designed
to
assemble
into
trimeric
and
pentameric
clusters
.
.....
This
allows
a
mathematical
description
of
particle
architectures
in
terms
of
bipartite
(
3,5
)
-regular
graphs
.
.....
Exploiting
the
relation
with
fullerene
graphs
,
we
provide
a
complete
atlas
of
SAPN
morphologies
.
.....
The
classification
enables
a
detailed
understanding
of
the
spectrum
of
possible
particle
geometries
that
can
arise
in
the
self-assembly
process
.
.....
Moreover
,
it
provides
a
toolkit
for
a

We

unbiased
sequencing
methods
for

in
shorebird

from
the
Delaware

Findings
:
Analysis
of
shorebird
fecal
samples
indicated
the
presence
of
a
novel

A

turnstone
sample
yielded

Conclusions
:
Our
findings
highlight
shorebirds
as

Glycyrrhizin
is
known
to
exert
antiviral
and
anti-inflammatory
effects
.
.....
Here
,
the
effects
of
an
approved
parenteral
glycyrrhizin
preparation
(
Stronger
Neo-Minophafen
C
)
were
investigated
on
highly
pathogenic
influenza
A
H5N1
virus
replication
,
H5N1-induced
apoptosis
,
and
H5N1-induced
pro-inflammatory
responses
in
lung
epithelial
(
A549
)
cells
.
.....
Therapeutic
glycyrrhizin
concentrations
substantially
inhibited
H5N1-induced
expression
of
the
pro-inflammatory
molecules
CXCL10
,
interleukin
6
,
CCL2
,
and
CCL5
(
effective
glycyrrhizin
concentrations
25
to
50
mg/ml
)
but
interfered
with
H5N1
replication
and
H5N1-induced
apoptosis
to
a
lesser
extent
(
effective
glycyrrhizin
concentrations
100
mg/ml
or
higher
)
.
.....
Glycyrrhizin
also
diminished
monocyte
migration
towards
supernatants
of
H5N1-infected
A549
cells
.
.....
The
mechanism
by
which
glycyrrhizin
interferes
with
H5N1
replication
and
H5N1-induced
pro-inflammatory
gene
expression
includes
inhibition
of
H5N1-induced
formation
of
reactive
oxygen
species
and
(
in
turn
)
reduced
activation
of
NFkB
,
JNK
,
and
p38
,
redoxsensitive
signalling
events
known
to
be
relevant
for
influenza
A
virus
replication
.
.....
Therefore
,
glycyrrhizin
may
complement
the
arsenal
of
potential
drugs
for
the
treatment
of
H5N1

Ranavirus
cross-species
infections

the
viral
proteins
involved
in
the

have
not
yet
been
identified
.
.....
Here
,
viral
cell-binding
proteins
and
their
cognate
cellular

were
investigated
using
two
ranaviruses
,
Andrias
davidianus
ranavirus
(

The
heparan
sulfate
(
HS
)
analog
heparin
inhibited
plaque
formation
of
ADRV
and
RGV
in
the
two
cell
lines
by
more
than
80
%
at
a
concentration
of
5
µg/mL
.
.....
In
addition
,
enzymatic
removal
of
cell
surface
HS
by
heparinase
I
markedly
reduced
plaque
formation
by
both
viruses
and
competition
with
heparin
reduced
virus-cell
binding
.
.....
These
results
indicate
that
cell
surface
HS
is
involved
in
ADRV
and
RGV
cell
binding
and
infection
.

Furthermore
,
recombinant
viral
envelope
proteins
ADRV-58L
and
RGV-53R
bound
heparin-Sepharose
beads
implying
the
potential
that
cell
surface
HS
is
involved
in
the
initial
interaction
between
ranaviruses
and
susceptible
host
cells
.
.....
To
our
knowledge
,
this
is
the
first
report
identifying
cell
surface
HS
as
ranavirus
binding
factor
and
furthers
understanding
of
interactions
between
ranaviruses
and

of
the

Mononegavirales
.
.....
There
is
now
compelling
evidence
that
enveloped
virions
released
from
infected
cells
carry
numerous
host
(
cellular
)
proteins
some
of
which
may
play
an
important
role
in
viral

Although
several
cellular
proteins
have
been
previously
shown
to
be
incorporated
into
VSV

Here
we
used
a
proteomics
approach

identify
cellular

purified
VSV

thereby
creating
a

We
have
successfully
confirmed
the
presence
of
several
previously-identified
cellular
proteins
within
VSV
virions
and
identified
a
number
of
additional
proteins
likely
to
also
be
present
within
the
virions
.

In
total
,
sixty-four
cellular
proteins
were
identified
,
of
which
nine
were
found
in
multiple
preparations
.

A
combination

Conclusion
:
This

Histopathological

revealed
that

The

0.95
,
standard
techniques
yield
few
rules
for
sendout
tests

several
for
in-house
tests
,
mostly
for

the
complete

Most
rules
were
clinically

several
seemed
clinically
useful
for
informing
pre-test

Conclusion
:
S.

Several

Susceptibility

encode
for

homologous
to
those
of
the

while
the
autoantigens
are

to
pathogens

,
suggesting
that
the
risk-promoting
effects
of

are
conditional

Many
such

are
immunogenic
suggesting
that
antibody
mediated
knockdown
of
multiple
schizophrenia

products
could
contribute
to
the

,
explaining
the
immune
activation

the
preponderance

An

Our
results
support
the
hypothesis
that

are
a

that

The
recent
outbreak
of
coronavirus
disease
caused

To
develop
specific
anti-coronavirus
therapeutics

prophylactics
,
the
molecular
mechanism
that
underlies
viral
infection
must
first
be
defined
.

Therefore
,
we
herein
established
a
SARS-CoV-2
spike
(
S
)
protein-mediated
cell-cell
fusion
assay
and
found
that
SARS-CoV-2
showed
a
superior
plasma
membrane
fusion
capacity
compared
to
that
of
SARS-CoV

the

in
the

,
revealing
that
several
mutated
amino
acid

may
be
associated
with
enhanced

.....
We
previously
developed
a
pan-coronavirus
fusion
inhibitor
,
EK1

targeted
the
HR1
domain
and
could
inhibit
infection
by
divergent
human
coronaviruses
tested
,
including
SARS-CoV
and

.
.....
Here
we
generated
a
series
of
lipopeptides
derived
from
EK1

found
that
EK1C4
was
the
most
potent

against
SARS-CoV-2

Contaminated
feed

been
suggested
as
a
vehicle
of

The
objective
of
this

was
to
compare
thermal
and
electron
beam
processing
,
and
the
inclusion
of
feed
additives
on
the
inactivation
of
PEDV
in

Feed
samples
were
spiked
with
PEDV
and
then
heated
to
120-145°C

up
to
30
min

up
to
21
days
.
.....
At
the
end
of
incubation
,
the
virus
titers
were
determined
by
inoculation
of
Vero-81
cells
and
the
virus
inactivation
kinetics
were
modeled
using
the
Weibull
distribution
model
.

The
Weibull
kinetic
parameter
delta
represented
the
time
or
eBeam
dose
required
to
reduce
virus
concentration
by
1
log
.
.....
For
thermal
processing
,
delta
values
ranged
from
16.52
min
at
120°C
to
1.30
min
at
145°C
.
.....
For
eBeam
processing
,
a
target
dose
of
50
kGy
reduced
PEDV
concentration
by
3
log
.
.....
All
additives
tested
were
effective
in
reducing
the
survival
of
PEDV
when
compared
with
the
control
sample
(
delta
=
17.23
days
)
.
.....
Activate
DA
(
0.81
)
and
KEM-GEST
(
3.28
)
produced
the
fastest
inactivation
.
.....
In
conclusion
,
heating
swine
feed
at
temperatures
over
130°C
or
eBeam
processing
of
feed
with
a
dose
over
50
kGy
are
effective
processing
steps
to
reduce
PEDV
survival
.

Additionally
,
the
inclusion
of
selected
additives
can
decrease

During

,
excessive

High
MCP-1
serum
levels
are
detected
during
the
viremic
phase
of
CHIKV
infection
and
correlate
with
the
virus
titre
.
.....
In
vitro
CHIKV
infection
was
also
shown
to
stimulate
MCP-1
production
in
whole
blood
;
yet
the
role
and
the
mechanism
of
MCP-1
production
upon
infection
of
human
peripheral
blood
mononuclear
cells
remain
unknown
.
.....
Here
we
found
that
active
CHIKV
infection
stimulated
production
of
MCP-1
in
monocytes
.
.....
Importantly
however
,
we
found
that
communication
with
other
leukocytes
is
crucial
to
yield
MCP-1
by
monocytes
upon
CHIKV
infection
.
.....
Indeed
,
blocking
interferon-α/β
receptor
or
the
JAK1/JAK2
signalling
downstream
of
the
receptor
abolished
CHIKV-mediated
MCP-1
production
.
.....
Additionally
,
we
show
that
despite
the
apparent
correlation
between
IFN
type
I
,
CHIKV
replication
and
MCP-1
,
modulating
the
levels
of
the
chemokine
did
not
influence
CHIKV
infection
.
.....
In
summary
,
our
data
disclose
the
complexity
of
MCP-1
regulation
upon
CHIKV
infection
and
point
to
a
crucial
role
of
IFNβ
in
the
chemokine
secretion
.
.....
We
propose
that
balance
between
these
soluble
factors
is
imperative
for
an
appropriate
host
response
to
CHIKV
infection

CAP
)
is
a
significant
problem
in
developing
countries
,
and
confirmation
of
microbial
etiology
is
important
for
individual
,
as
well
as
public
health
.
.....
However
,
there
is
paucity
of
data
from
a
large
cohort
,
examining
multiple
biological
specimens
for
diverse
pathogens

Almost
half
of
known
plant
viral
species
rely
on
proteolytic
cleavages
as
key
coand
post-translational
modifications
throughout
their
infection
cycle
.
.....
Most
of
these
viruses
encode
their
own
endopeptidases
,
proteases
with
high
substrate
specificity
that
internally
cleave
large
polyprotein
precursors
for
the
release
of
functional
subunits
.
.....
Processing
of
the
polyprotein
,
however
,
is
not
an
all-or-nothing
process
in
which
endopeptidases
act
as
simple
peptide
cutters
.
.....
On
the
contrary
,
spatial-temporal
modulation
of
these
polyprotein
cleavage
events
is
crucial
for
a
successful
viral
infection
.
.....
In
this
way
,
the
processing
of
the
polyprotein
coordinates
viral
replication
,
assembly
and
movement
,
and
has
significant
impact
on
pathogen
fitness
and
virulence
.
.....
In
this
minireview
,
we
give
an
overview
of
plant
viral
proteases
emphasizing
their
importance
during
viral
infections
and
the
varied
functionalities
that
result
from
their
proteolytic
activities
.

Background
:
With
the
emergence
of
influenza
H1N1v
the
world
is
facing
its
first
21
st
century
global
pandemic
.
.....
Severe
Acute
Respiratory
Syndrome
(
SARS
)
and
avian
influenza
H5N1
prompted
development
of
pandemic
preparedness
plans
.
.....
National
systems
of
public
health
law
are
essential
for
public
health
stewardship
and
for
the
implementation
of
public
health
policy
[

]
.
.....
International
coherence
will
contribute
to
effective
regional
and
global
responses
.
.....
However
little
research
has
been
undertaken
on
how
law
works
as
a
tool
for
disease
control
in
Europe
.
.....
With
co-funding
from
the
European
Union
,
we
investigated
the
extent
to
which
laws
across
Europe
support
or
constrain
pandemic
preparedness
planning
,
and
whether
national
differences
are
likely
to
constrain
control
efforts
.
.....
We
undertook
a
survey
of
national
public
health
laws
across
32
European
states
using
a
questionnaire
designed
around
a
disease
scenario
based
on
pandemic
influenza
.
.....
Questionnaire
results
were
reviewed
in
workshops
,
analysing
how
differences
between
national
laws
might
support
or
hinder
regional
responses
to
pandemic
influenza
.
.....
Respondents
examined
the
impact
of
national
laws
on
the
movements
of
information
,
goods
,
services
and
people
across
borders
in
a
time
of
pandemic
,
the
capacity
for
surveillance
,

,
the
deployment
of

Results
:
Results
of
this
study
show
differences
across
Europe
in
the
extent
to
which
national
pandemic
policy
and
pandemic
plans
have
been
integrated
with
public
health
laws
.
.....
We
found
significant
differences
in
legislation
and
in
the
legitimacy
of
strategic
plans
.
.....
States
differ
in
the
range
and
the
nature
of
intervention
measures
authorized
by
law
,
the
extent
to
which
borders
could
be
closed
to
movement
of
persons
and
goods
during
a
pandemic
,
and
access
to
healthcare
of
non-resident
persons
.
.....
Some
states
propose
use
of
emergency
powers
that
might
potentially
override
human
rights
protections
while
other
states
propose
to
limit
interventions
to
those
authorized
by
public
health
laws
.
.....
Conclusion
:
These
differences
could
create
problems
for
European
strategies
if
an
evolving
influenza
pandemic
results
in
more
serious
public
health
challenges
or
,
indeed
,
if
a
novel
disease
other
than
influenza
emerges
with
pandemic
potential
.
.....
There
is
insufficient
understanding
across
Europe
of
the
role
and
importance
of
law
in
pandemic
planning
.
.....
States
need
to
build
capacity
in
public
health
law
to
support
disease
prevention
and
control
policies
.
.....
Our
research
suggests
that
states
would
welcome
further
guidance
from
the
EU
on
management
of
a
pandemic
,
and
guidance
to
assist
in
greater
commonality
of
legal
approaches
across

Methods
:
From
February

,
we
actively
identified
and
enrolled
patients
in
two
hospitals
with
acute
respiratory

,
collected
throat

Most
commonly

Conclusions
:
Most
clinicians
have
limited
awareness
of
and
are
not
reporting
to
the
PUE
system
.
.....
Exposures
related
to
respiratory
infections
are
rarely
documented
in

'
awareness
of
the

Exosomes
are
extracellular
vesicles
released
upon
fusion
of
multivesicular
bodies
(
MVBs
)
with
the
cellular
plasma
membrane
.
.....
They
originate
as
intraluminal
vesicles
(
ILVs
)
during
the
process
of
MVB
formation
.
.....
Exosomes
were
shown
to
contain
selectively
sorted
functional
proteins
,
lipids
,
and
RNAs
,
mediating
cell-to-cell
communications
and
hence
playing
a
role
in
the
physiology
of
the
healthy
and
diseased
organism
.
.....
Challenges
in
the
field
include
the
identification
of
mechanisms
sustaining
packaging
of
membrane-bound
and
soluble
material
to
these
vesicles
and
the
understanding
of
the
underlying
processes
directing
MVBs
for
degradation
or
fusion
with
the
plasma
membrane
.
.....
The
investigation
into
the
formation
and
roles
of
exosomes
in
viral
infection
is
in
its
early
years
.
.....
Although
still
controversial
,
exosomes
can
,
in
principle
,
incorporate
any
functional
factor
,
provided
they
have
an
appropriate
sorting
signal
,
and
thus
are
prone
to
viral
exploitation
.
.....
This
review
initially
focuses
on
the
composition
and
biogenesis
of
exosomes
.
.....
It
then
explores
the
regulatory
mechanisms
underlying
their
biogenesis
.
.....
Exosomes
are
part
of
the
endocytic
system
,
which
is
tightly
regulated
and
able
to
respond
to
several
stimuli
that
lead
to
alterations
in
the
composition
of
its
sub-compartments
.
.....
We
discuss
the
current
knowledge
of
how
these
changes
affect
exosomal
release
.
.....
We
then
summarize
how
different
viruses
exploit
specific
proteins
of
endocytic
sub-compartments
and
speculate
that
it
could
interfere
with
exosome
function
,
although
no
direct
link
between
viral
usage
of
the
endocytic
system
and
exosome
release
has
yet
been
reported
.
.....
Many
recent
reports
have
ascribed
functions
to
exosomes
released
from
cells
infected
with
a
variety
of
animal
viruses
,
including
viral
spread
,
host
immunity
,
and
manipulation
of
the
microenvironment
,
which
are
discussed
.
.....
Given
the
ever-growing
roles
and
importance
of
exosomes
in
viral
infections
,
understanding
what
regulates
their
composition
and
levels
,
and
defining
their
functions
will
ultimately
provide
additional
insights
into
the
virulence
and
persistence
of
infections
.
.....
The
primary
function
of
the
respiratory
system
of
gas
exchange
renders
it
vulnerable
to
environmental
pathogens
that
circulate
in
the
air
.
.....
Physical
and
cellular
barriers
of
the
respiratory
tract
mucosal
surface
utilize
a
variety
of
strategies
to
obstruct
microbe
entry
.
.....
Physical
barrier
defenses
including
the
surface
fluid
replete
with
antimicrobials
,
neutralizing
immunoglobulins
,
mucus
,
and
the
epithelial
cell
layer
with
rapidly
beating
cilia
form
a
near
impenetrable
wall
that
separates
the
external
environment
from
the
internal
soft
tissue
of
the
host
.
.....
Resident
leukocytes
,
primarily
of
the
innate
immune
branch
,
also
maintain
airway
integrity
by
constant
surveillance
and
the
maintenance
of
homeostasis
through
the
release
of
cytokines
and
growth
factors
.
.....
Unfortunately
,
pathogens
such
as
influenza
virus
and
Streptococcus
pneumoniae
require
hosts
for
their
replication
and
dissemination
,
and
prey
on
the
respiratory
tract
as
an
ideal
environment
causing
severe
damage
to
the
host
during
their
invasion
.
.....
In
this
review
,
we
outline
the
host-pathogen
interactions
during
influenza
and
post-influenza
bacterial
pneumonia
with
a
focus
on
interand
intra-cellular
crosstalk
important
in
pulmonary
immune
responses

MS2
phage-like
particles
(
MS2
PLP

are
artificially
constructed
pseudo-viral
particles
derived

They
are
able
to
carry
a
specific
single

RNA
(
ssRNA
)
sequence
of
choice
inside
their
capsid
,
thus
protecting
it
against
the
effects
of
ubiquitous
nucleases
.
.....
Such
particles
are
able
to
mimic
ssRNA
viruses
and
,
thus
,
may
serve
as
the
process
control
for
molecular
detection
and
quantification
of
such
agents
in
several
kinds
of
matrices

,
there
are
several
different

In
order
to
combine
all
the
advantages

the
available

a
unique
fusion
insertional
mutation
enabling
purification
of
particles
using
His-tag
affinity
.
.....
Using
this
new
production
system
,
highly
pure
MS2
PLP
can
be
quickly
produced
and
purified
by
a
fast
performance
liquid
chromatography
(
FPLC
)
approach
.
.....
The
system
can
be
easily
adapted
to
produce
other
MS2
PLP
with
different
properties
.
.....
MS2
phage-like
particles
(
MS2
PLP
)
are
artificial
pseudo-viral
particles
whose
production
is
based
on
knowledge
of
the
familiar
bacteriophage
MS2
(
+ssRNA
,
Leviviridae
)
1
and
the
ability
of
its
coat
protein
dimers
to
pack
specific
single-stranded
RNA
(
ssRNA
)
molecules
2-4
.
.....
The
packaging
is
driven
by
dimerization
of
coat
proteins
followed
by
a
specific
interaction
of
dimers
with
a
stem-loop
structure
(
called
the
``
pac
''
site
)
in
ssRNA
resulting
in
spontaneous
formation
of
MS2
PLP
.
.....
These
particles
are
small
in
size
(
about
27
nm
)
,
non-enveloped
,
non-infectious
,
non-replicative
,
stable
pseudo-viral
particles
with
the
ability
to
protect
encapsidated
ssRNA
molecules
against
the
effects
of
ubiquitous
nucleases
.
.....
Due
to
these
properties
and
their
morphological
and
physicochemical
characteristics
,
MS2
PLP
carrying
specific
ssRNA
molecules
can
serve
as
suitable
process
control
virus
(
PCV
)
for
the
detection
and
quantification
of
ssRNA
viruses
within
a
wide
range
of
samples
;
for
example
,
human
norovirus
(
NoV
)
,
human
enterovirus
(
EV
)
,
hepatitis
A
virus
(
HAV
)
,
hepatitis
E
virus
(
HEV
)
,
hepatitis
C
virus
(
HCV
)
,
and

virus
type

Perspectives
on
the
practical
use
of
MS2
PLP
as
RNA
vaccines
and
vaccine
candidates
,
drug
delivery
systems
,
and
systems
for
the
display
of
immunologically
active
peptides
or
nanomachines
are
discussed
in
a
recent
review
9
.
.....
Since
the
first
study
at
the
beginning
of
the
1990s
in
which
non-bacteriophage
RNA
was
encapsulated
by
MS2
coat
protein
dimers
,
many
different
methods
for
the
production
of
MS2
PLP
have
been
developed
4
.
.....
Currently
,
the
production
of
MS2
PLP
is
based
on
various
in
vivo
plasmid-driven
packaging
systems
,
which
exploit
the
spontaneous
assembly
of
MS2
coat
protein
dimers
in
the
presence
of
the
pac
site
inside
Escherichia
coli
(
E.
coli
)
10
.
.....
However
,
while
each
of
these
systems
have
their
advantages
,
they
are
also
characterized
by
various
drawbacks
,
e.g.
,
limited
capacity
for
packaging
of
control
ssRNA
,
lower
efficiency
of
packaging
,
complicated
system
construction
,
or
complicated
and
time-consuming
purification
of
produced
MS2
PLP
.
.....
The
newest
and
most
advanced
plasmid-driven
packaging
system
,
the
so-called
one-plasmid
double-expression
packaging
system
,
allows
construction
of
MS2
PLP
with
high
efficiency
and
packaging
specificity
,
and
allows
a
maximum
length
of
encapsidated
ssRNA
of
up
to
3,600
nucleotides
(
nt
)
11
.
.....
Recently
,
this
packaging
system
was
even
used
for
the
construction
of
MS2
PLP
carrying
a
4,942-nt-long
control
sequence
for
Zika
virus
12
.
.....
However
,
this
system
still
does
not
address
a
major
drawback
of
current
MS2
PLP
preparations
:
the
purification
procedure
.
.....
Therefore
,
produced
MS2
PLP
must
be
purified
in
a
time-consuming
and
laborious
ultracentrifugation
step
,
which
does
not
isolate
MS2
PLP
in
the
required
purity
4
,
8
,
10
,
11
,
13
.
.....
The
problem
of
purification
can
be
solved
by
the
introduction
of
an
affinity
tag
(
e.g.
,
polyhistidine-tag
;
His-tag
)
to
the
structure
of
MS2
PLP
allowing
their
purification
using
the
Co
2+
affinity
chromatography
method
13,14
.
.....
This
approach
enables
easy
and
fast
purification
of
huge
amounts
of
pure
MS2
PLP
.
.....
As
the
one-plasmid
double-expression
packaging
system
had
not
yet
been
developed
at
that
time
,
Cheng
et
al
.
.....
used
a
so-called
one-plasmid
expression
system
for
production
of
MS2
PLP
.
.....
The
system
has
limited
capacity
for
packaging
of
control
sequences
(
up
to
2,000
nt
)
,
and
the
particles
contain
undesirable
sequences
from
bacteriophage
MS2
10,13
.
.....
Based
on
this
knowledge
,
none
of
the
previously
used
plasmid-driven
systems
for
production
of
MS2
PLP
is
ideal
.
.....
The
novelty
of
the
present
study
lies
not
only
in
combination
of
all
the
experience
acquired
so
far
with
the
different
methods
of
MS2
PLP
construction
for
developing
a
new
plasmid-driven
construction
system
,
which
integrates
all
the
advantages
and
benefits
of
the
previously
described
systems
.
.....
This
is
also
the
first
report
about
the
construction
of
single-chain
version
of
the
coat
protein
dimer
containing
the
His-tag
capable
to
successfully
form
intact
His-tagged
MS2
PLP
that
can
be
purified
in
less
than
one
hour
by
FPLC
.
.....
Moreover
,
presented
approach
solves
the
previous
problem
of
introduction
of
His-tag
to
structure
of
the
coat
protein
in
parallel
with
formation
of
whole
intact
MS2
PLP

Background
:
Growing
number
of
confirmed
and
deaths
cases
from
the
coronavirus
worldwide
,
particularly
in
Italy
,
Iran
and
South
Korea
,
has
resulted
concerns
about
the
future
of
these
countries
and
their
deterioration
.
.....
Also
the
European
region
is
likely
to
face
more
casualties
due
to
the
delay
in
the
virus
reaching
most
of
its
regions
and
,
of
course
,
as
the
trend
continues
.
.....
Methods
:
We
conducted
a
simulation
in
both
current
and
ideal
situation
for
the
next
month
to
predict
the
death
rate
and
examine
the
reason
for
the
difference
in
Italy
,
Iran
and
South
Korea
individually
.
.....
If
we
assume
the
cultural
and
political
factors
and
age
pyramids
distribution
are
similar
across
regions
,
the
differences
are
mainly
due
either
to
the
heavier
health-care
burden
owing
to
the
larger
population
or
to
the
medical
facilities
diversities
.
.....
Results
:
Our
results
for
Italy
showed
higher
death
number
,
but
the
rate
would
be
more
for
Iran
.
.....
South
Korea
is
also
expected
to
have
a
smaller
increase
in
the
number
of
confirmed
cases
and
deaths
compared
to
Iran
and
Italy
by
the
next
month
.

Conclusion
:
Given
the
prevailing
conditions
around
the
world
and
the
increasing
number
of
casualties
,
it
is
essential
that
all
countries
,
especially
those
with
fewer
days
of
involvement
,
shall
do
their
best
to
avoid
major
losses
and
damages

There
are
four
human
coronaviruses
(
HCoVs
)
,
distributed
worldwide
,
that
are
associated
with
a
range
of
respiratory
symptoms
.
.....
The
discovery
of
severe
acute
respiratory
syndrome
(
SARS
)
-CoV
and
Middle
East
respiratory
syndrome
(
MERS
)
-CoV
shows
that
HCoVs
pose
a
significant
threat
to
human
health
.
.....
Our
work
aims
to
develop
a
sensitive
method
(
mCoV-MS
)
which
can
not
only
identify
known
HCoVs
accurately
,
but
also
have
the
ability
to
provide
clues
for
the
emerging
HCoVs
.
.....
The
method
was
performed
using
a
MassARRAY
matrix-assisted
laser
desorption/ionization
time-of-flight
mass
spectrometry
(
MALDI-TOF
MS
)
system
.
.....
We
developed
a
17-plex
analysis
to
detect
six
HCoVs
in
Panel
A
and
another
17-plex
analysis
to
detect
Alphacoronavirus
and
Betacoronavirus
in
Panel
B
.
.....
All
tested
primers
and
probes
for
the
mCoV-MS
method
were
effective
,
with
no
cross-reactivity
observed
with
other
common
respiratory
viruses
.
.....
To
confirm
the
usefulness
of
the
mCoV-MS
method
we
screened
384
pharyngeal
and/or
anal
swab
samples
collected
from
bats/rodents
,
and
131
nasal
and
throat
swabs
from
human
patients
.
.....
The
results
showed
good
concordance
with
the
results
of
metagenomic
analysis
or
PCR-sequencing
.
.....
The
validation
test
showed
mCoV-MS
method
can
detect
potentially
pathogenic
CoVs
in
Alphacoronavirus
and
Betacoronavirus
and
provide
convincingly
phylogenetic
evidences
about
unknown
CoVs
.
.....
The
mCoV-MS
method
is
a
sensitive
assay
that
is
relatively
simple
to
carry
out
.
.....
We
propose
that
this
method
be
used
to
complement
next
generation
sequencing
technology
for
large-scale
screening
studies

PED
virus
(
PEDV
)
spreads
by
fecal-oral
contact
and
can
be
prevented
by
oral
immunization
.
.....
Therefore
,
it
is
necessary
to
develop
an
effective
oral
vaccine
against
PEDV
infection
.
.....
Currently
,
Bacillus

as
recombinant
vaccine
carrier
has
been
used
for
antigen
delivery
and
proved
well
in
immune
effect
and
safety
.

The
present
study
evaluated
the
immunogenicity
of
recombinant
Bacillus
subtilis
(
B.
subtilis-RC
)
in
piglets
via
oral
administration
.
.....
After
oral
immunization
in
piglets
,
B.
subtilis-RC
significantly
increased
the
local
mucosal
immune
responses
.
.....
Oral
administration
with
B.
subtilis-RC
significantly
improved
the
level
of
specific
mucosal
immunoglobulin
A
(
IgA
)
antibodies
against
PEDV
infection
,
through
enlarging
the
area
of
Peyer
's
patches
(
PPs
)
and
increasing
the
number
of
ileum
IgA
+
secreting
(
SIgA
)
cells
.
.....
In
the
meantime
,
B.
subtilis-RC
remarkably
increased
the
number
of
intraepithelial
lymphocytes
(
IELs
)
.
.....
We
also
observed
that
oral
administration
of
B.
subtilis-RC
significantly
increased
CD3
+
T
lymphocytes
'
numbers
and
up-regulated
the
ratio
of
CD4
+
/CD8
+
T
cells
.
.....
Furthermore
,
high
titers
of
specific
serum
immunoglobulin
G
(
IgG
)
revealed
satisfactory
systemic
immune
response
against
PEDV
infection
.
.....
In
summary
,
our
study
demonstrated
that
oral
administration
of
B.
subtilis-RC
could
trigger
a
high
level
of
local
and
systemic
immune
responses
and
would
be
a
promising
candidate
vaccine
against
PEDV
infection
in
piglets
.

South
Korea
is
one
of
the
countries
most
affected
by
COVID-19
from
the
very
early
stages
of
this
pandemic
.
.....
Explosive
outbreaks
occurred
across
South
Korea
in
the
first
two
months
,
and
efforts
to
control
this
new

have
involved
everyone
across
the
country
.
.....
To
curb
the
transmission
of
the
virus
,
health-care
professionals
,
committees
,
and
governments
have
combined
many
approaches
,
such
as
extensive
COVID-19
screening
,
effective
patient
triage
,
the
transparent
provision
of
information
,
and
the
use
of

technology
.

This
experience

provide
some
valuable

Transmissible
gastroenteritis
virus
(
TGEV
)
is
an
infective
coronavirus
(
CoV
)
that
causes
diarrhea-related
morbidity
and
mortality
in
piglets
.
.....
For
the
first
time
,
a
natural
recombination
strain
of
a
TGEV
Anhui
Hefei
(
AHHF
)
virus
between
the
Purdue
and
the
Miller
clusters
was
isolated
from
the
small
intestine
content
of
piglets
in
China
.
.....
A
phylogenetic
tree
based
on
a
complete
genome
sequence
placed
the
TGEV
AHHF
strain
between
the
Purdue
and
the
Miller
clusters
.
.....
The
results
of
a
computational
analysis
of
recombination
showed
that
the
TGEV
AHHF
strain
is
a
natural
recombinant
strain
between
these
clusters
.
.....
Two
breakpoints
located
in
the
open
reading
frame
1a
(
ORF1a
)
and
spike
(
S
)
genes
were
identified
.
.....
The
pathogenicity
of
the
TGEV
AHHF
strain
was
evaluated
in
piglets
,
and
the
results
show
that
TGEV
AHHF
is
an
enteric
pathogenic
strain
.
.....
These
results
provide
valuable
information
about
the
recombination
and
evolution
of
CoVs
and
will
facilitate
future
investigations
of
the
molecular
pathogenesis
of
TGEV
.

Background
:
The
advancements
in
DNA
sequencing
technologies
have
allowed
researchers
to
progress
from
the
analyses
of
a
single
organism
towards
the
deep
sequencing
of
a
sample
of
organisms
.
.....
With
sufficient
sequencing
depth
,
it
is
now
possible
to
detect
subtle
variations
between
members
of
the
same
species
,
or
between
mixed
species
with
shared
biomarkers
,
such
as
the
16S
rRNA
gene
.
.....
However
,
traditional
sequencing
analyses
of
samples
from
largely
homogeneous
populations
are
often
still
based
on
multiple
sequence
alignments
(
MSA
)
,
where
each
sequence
is
placed
along
a
separate
row
and
similarities
between
aligned
bases
can
be
followed
down
each
column
.
.....
While
this
visual
format
is
intuitive
for
a
small
set
of
aligned
sequences
,
the
representation
quickly
becomes
cumbersome
as
sequencing
depths
cover
loci
hundreds
or
thousands
of
reads
deep
.
.....
We
have
developed
ANDES
,
a
software
library
and
a
suite
of
applications
,
written
in
Perl
and
R
,
for
the
statistical
ANalyses
of
DEep
Sequencing
.
.....
The
fundamental
data
structure
underlying
ANDES
is
the
position
profile
,
which
contains
the
nucleotide
distributions
for
each
genomic
position
resultant
from
a
multiple
sequence
alignment
(
MSA
)
.
.....
Tools
include
the
root
mean
square
deviation
(
RMSD
)
plot
,
which
allows
for
the
visual
comparison
of
multiple
samples
on
a
position-by-position
basis
,
and
the
computation
of
base
conversion
frequencies
(
transition/transversion
rates
)
,
variation
(
Shannon
entropy
)
,
inter-sample
clustering
and

(
dendrogram

multidimensional
scaling

)
plot
)
,
threshold-driven
consensus
sequence
generation
and
polymorphism
detection
,
and
the
estimation
of
empirically
determined
sequencing
quality
values
.
.....
As
new
sequencing
technologies
evolve
,
deep
sequencing
will
become
increasingly
cost-efficient
and
the
inter
and
intra-sample
comparisons
of
largely
homogeneous
sequences
will
become
more
common
.
.....
We
have
provided
a

Much
attention
has
been
given
to
the
administration
of
antiviral
drugs
,
but
contact
reduction
can
also
be
an
effective
part
of
mitigation
strategies
and
has
the
advantage
to
be
not
limited
per
se
.
.....
The
effectiveness
of
these
interventions
depends
on
various
factors
which
must
be
explored
by
sensitivity
analyses
,
based
on
mathematical
models
.
.....
We
use
the
freely
available
planning
tool
InfluSim
to
investigate
how
pharmaceutical
and
non-pharmaceutical
interventions
can
mitigate
an
influenza
pandemic
.
.....
In
particular
,
we
examine
how
intervention
schedules
,
restricted
stockpiles
and
contact
reduction
(
social
distancing
measures
and
isolation
of
cases
)
determine
the
course
of
a
pandemic
wave
and
the
success
of
interventions
.
.....
Results
:
A
timely
application
of
antiviral
drugs
combined
with
a
quick
implementation
of
contact
reduction
measures
is
required
to
substantially
protract
the
peak
of
the
epidemic
and
reduce
its
height
.
.....
Delays
in
the
initiation
of
antiviral
treatment
(
e.g
.
.....
because
of
parsimonious
use
of
a
limited
stockpile
)
result
in
much
more
pessimistic
outcomes
and
can
even
lead
to
the
paradoxical
effect
that
the
stockpile
is
depleted
earlier
compared
to
early
distribution
of
antiviral
drugs
.
.....
Pharmaceutical
and
non-pharmaceutical
measures
should
not
be
used
exclusively
.
.....
The
protraction
of
the
pandemic
wave
is
essential
to
win
time
while
waiting
for
vaccine
development
and
production
.
.....
However
,
it
is
the
height
of
the
peak
of
an
epidemic
which
can
easily
overtax
general
practitioners
,
hospitals
or
even
whole
public
health

During
the
last
4
years
,
corona
viruses
have
become
the
most
important
viruses
worldwide
because
of
the
occurrence
of
several
recent
deaths

;
however
,
most
cases
of
mortality
have
occurred
in

Owing
to
the
predominance
of

,
the
virus
was
renamed

In

Studies
of
the

To
date
,
no
antiviral
or
vaccine
is
available
for
this
common
viral
infection
.

Immunomodulators
could
represent
an
interesting
strategy
for
the

Recently
,
the
role
of
protease-activated
receptors
(
PAR
)
in
inflammation
,
coagulation
and
infection
processes
has
been
of
growing
interest
.
.....
Herein
,
the
effects
of
a
PAR1
agonist
and
a
PAR1
antagonist
on
hMPV
infection
were
investigated
in
BALB/c
mice
.
.....
Intranasal
administration
of
the
PAR1
agonist
resulted
in
increased
weight
loss
and
mortality
of
infected
mice
.
.....
Conversely
,
the
PAR1
antagonist
was
beneficial
to
hMPV
infection
by
decreasing
weight
loss
and
clinical
signs
and
by
significantly
reducing
pulmonary
inflammation
,
pro-inflammatory
cytokine
levels
(
including
IL-6
,
KC
and
MCP-1
)
and
recruitment
of
immune
cells
to
the
lungs
.
.....
In
addition
,
a
significant
reduction
in
pulmonary
viral
titers
was
also
observed
in
the
lungs
of
PAR1
antagonist-treated
mice
.
.....
Despite
no
apparent
direct
effect
on
virus
replication
during
in
vitro
experiments
,
an
important
role
for
PAR1
in
the
regulation
of
furin
expression
in
the
lungs
was
shown
for
the
first
time
.
.....
Further
experiments
indicated
that
the
hMPV
fusion
protein
can
be
cleaved
by
furin
thus
suggesting
that
PAR1
could
have
an
effect
on
viral
infectivity
in
addition
to
its
immunomodulatory
properties
.
.....
Thus
,
inhibition
of
PAR1
by
selected
antagonists
could
represent
an
interesting
strategy
for
decreasing
the
severity
of
paramyxovirus
infections
.

The
genus
Orthopoxvirus
contains
several
species
of
related
viruses
,
including
the
causative
agent
of
smallpox
(
Variola
virus
)
.
.....
In
addition
to
smallpox
,
several
other
members
of
the
genus
are
capable
of
causing
human
infection
,
including
monkeypox
,
cowpox
,
and
other
zoonotic
rodent-borne
poxviruses
.
.....
Therefore
,
a
single
assay
that
can
accurately
identify
all
orthopoxviruses
could
provide
a
valuable
tool
for
rapid
broad
orthopovirus
identification
.
.....
We
have
developed
a
pan-Orthopoxvirus
assay
for
identification
of
all
members
of
the
genus
based
on
four
PCR
reactions
targeting
Orthopoxvirus
DNA
and
RNA
helicase
and
polymerase
genes

.....
We
demonstrate
that
the
assay
can
detect
and
identify
a
diverse
collection
of
orthopoxviruses
,
provide
sub-species
information

Particularly
when

Mannose-binding
lectin
(
MBL
)
is
a
serum
protein
that
recognizes
a
wide
range
of
pathogenic
microorganisms
and
activates
complement
cascade
via
the
antibody-independent
pathway
.

More
than
30
%
of
humans
harbor
mutations
in
MBL
gene
(
MBL2
)
resulting
in
reduced
plasmatic
levels
and
activity
.
.....
Increased
risk
of
infection
acquisition
has
been
largely
documented
in
MBL-deficient
patients
,
but
the
real
impact
of
this
form
of
innate
immunosuppression
upon
clinical
outcome
is
not
clear
.
.....
In
critically
ill
patients
higher
incidence
and
worse
prognosis
of
severe
sepsis/septic
shock
appear
to
be
associated
with
low-producers
haplotypes
.
.....
However
an
excess
of
MBL
activation
might
be
also
harmful
due
to
the
possibility
of
an
unbalanced
proinflammatory
response

an
additional

Our

The

However
,
several

Influenza
A
virus
nucleoprotein

a
major
virion

has
been
predicted
to
interact
with
negative-strand
viral
RNA

NP
encapsulates
the
viral
genome
for
RNA
transcription
,
replication
,
virus
packaging
,
and
intracellular

as
a
key
adapter
molecule
between

.
.....
NP
has
been
shown
to
cooperatively
interact
with
RNA
.
.....
In
addition
,
NP
interacts
with
a
wide
variety
of
viral
and
cellular
macromolecules
,
including
two
subunits

According
to
protein
sequence
alignment
,
the
498-aa
NP
is
highly
conserved
among
influenza
viruses
.
.....
The
multifunctional
capabilities
of
NP
in
the
viral
life
cycle
makes
this
protein
an
attractive
target
for
drug
development

A
substantial
quantity
of

with
a
stoichiometric
ratio
of
20
nucleotides
of
RNA

The
NP

reveals
that

However
,
understanding
structural
and
mechanistic
information
regarding
influenza
A
virus
NP
and
its
interactions
with
RNA
should
facilitate
the
discovery
of
agents
that
specifically
block
the
formation
of
ribonucleoprotein
(
RNP
)
during
viral
genome
replication
.
.....
Accordingly
,
we
proposed
that
the
surface
of
the
groove
,
which
contains
numerous
conserved
residues
(
including
Y148

)
is
able
to
interact
with
the
RNA
residue
(

)
.
.....
In
this
study
,
we
performed
a
series
of
site-directed
mutagenesis
to
explore
the
mechanism
by
which
the
NP
binds
RNA
,
followed
by
surface
plasmon
resonance
(
SPR
)
to
monitor
the
binding
between
various
mutants
and
RNA
.
.....
Furthermore
,
a
role
of
Y148
in
the
protein
stability
of
NP
and
the
binding
of
NP
to
RNA
was
evaluated
.
.....
An
aromatic
residue
,
Y148
was
also
found
to
stack
its
benzene
ring
with
a
nucleotide
base
.
.....
By
targeting
Y148
,
we
identified
an
influenza
virus
NP
inhibitor
,
H7
[
(
E
,
E
)
-1,7-bis
(
4-hydroxy-3-me

-1,6-heptadiene-3,5-dione
]
,
which
reduced
the
NP
's
RNA-binding
affinity
and
hindered
viral
replication
.
.....
Finally
,
we
present
a
structural
model
of
the
influenza
NP
in
complex
with
RNA
,
which
clearly
illustrates
the
critical
role
of
Y148
.
.....
Influenza
infection
and
pneumonia
are
known
to
cause
much
of
their
mortality
by
inducing
acute
respiratory
distress
syndrome
(
ARDS
)
,
which
is
the
most
severe
form
of
acute
lung
injury
(
ALI
)
.
.....
Angiotensin-converting
enzyme
2
(
ACE2
)
,
which
is
a
negative
regulator
of
angiotensin
II
in
the
renin-angiotensin
system
,
has
been
reported
to
have
a
crucial
role
in
ALI
.
.....
Downregulation
of
ACE2
is
always
associated
with
the
ALI
or
ARDS
induced
by
avian
influenza
virus
,
severe
acute
respiratory
syndrome-coronavirus
,
respiratory
syncytial
virus
and
sepsis
.
.....
However
,
the
molecular
mechanism
of
the
decreased
expression
of
ACE2
in
ALI
is
unclear
.
.....
Here
we
show
that
avian
influenza
virus
H5N1
induced
the
upregulation
of
miR-200c-3p
,
which
was
then
demonstrated
to
target
the
3′-untranslated
region
of
ACE2
.
.....
Then
,
we
found
that
nonstructural
protein
1
and
viral
RNA
of
H5N1
contributed
to
the
induction
of
miR-200c-3p
during
viral
infection
.
.....
Additionally
,
the
synthetic
analog
of
viral
double-stranded
RNA
(
poly
(
I
:
C
)
)
,
bacterial
lipopolysaccharide
and
lipoteichoic
acid
can
all
markedly
increase
the
expression
of
miR-200c-3p
in
a
nuclear
factor-κB-dependent
manner
.
.....
Furthermore
,
markedly
elevated
plasma
levels
of
miR-200c-3p
were
observed
in
severe
pneumonia
patients
.
.....
The
inhibition
of
miR-200c-3p
ameliorated
the
ALI
induced
by
H5N1
virus
infection
in
vivo
,
indicating
a
potential
therapeutic
target
.
.....
Therefore
,
we
identify
a
shared
mechanism
of
viral
and
bacterial
lung
infection-induced
ALI/ARDS
via
nuclear
factor-κB-dependent
upregulation
of
miR-200c-3p
to
reduce
ACE2
levels
,
which
leads
increased
angiotensin
II
levels
and
subsequently
causes
lung
injury

The

on
both
the

in

However
,
distinguishing
between
these

properties
typically
requires
detailed
serological
studies
,
which
are
rarely

the

Using
a
simple
transmission
model
that
incorporates
age-stratified
social
mixing
patterns
,
we
present
a
novel
method
for
characterizing
the

potential
of
subcritical
infections
,
which
have
effective
reproduction

readily
available

We
show
that
the
model
can
identify
the
extent
to
which
outbreaks
are
driven
by
inherent
pathogen
transmissibility
and
pre-existing
population
immunity
,
and
can
generate
unbiased
estimates
of
the
effective
reproduction
number
.
.....
Applying
the
method
to
real-life
infections
,
we
obtained
accurate
estimates
for
the
degree
of
age-specific
immunity
against
monkeypox
,
influenza
A
(
H5N1

and
A

,
and
refined
existing
estimates
of
the
reproduction
number
.
.....
Our
results
also
suggest
minimal
pre-existing
immunity
to
MERS-CoV
in
humans
.
.....
The
approach
we
describe
can
therefore
provide
crucial
information
about
novel
infections
before
serological
surveys
and
other
detailed
analyses
are
available
.

The
methods
would
also
be
applicable
to
data
stratified
by
factors
such
as
profession
or
location
,
which
would
make
it
possible
to
measure
the
transmission
potential
of
emerging
infections
in
a
wide
range
of
settings
.

The
transmission
potential
of
a
new
infection
depends
on
both
the
transmissibility
of
the
pathogen
and
the
level
of
immunity
in
the
host
population
.

However
,
it
can
be
difficult
to
measure
these
properties
if
there
are
limited
experimental
studies
of
population
immunity
.
.....
By
incorporating
social
contact
patterns
into
a
mathematical
model
of
disease
transmission
,
we
show
that
it

Controlling
viral
infections
by
disrupting
viral
entry
is
advantageous
for
antibody-mediated
neutralization
by
the
host
's
immune
system
and
as
a
preventive
and
therapeutic
antiviral
strategy
.
.....
Recently
,
several
plant-derived
carbohydrate-binding
proteins
(
lectins
)
have
emerged
as
a
new
class
of
antiviral
biologics
by
taking
advantage
of
a
unique
glycosylation
pattern
only
found
on
the
surface
of
viruses
.
.....
In
particular
,
a
red
algae-derived
griffithsin
(
GRFT
)
protein
has
demonstrated
superior
in
vitro
and
in
vivo
antiviral
activity
with
minimum
host
toxicity
against
a
variety
of
clinically
relevant
,
enveloped
viruses
.
.....
This
review
examines
the
structural
characteristics
of
GRFT
,
focusing
on
its
carbohydrate-binding
capability
.
.....
Its
in
vitro
antiviral
profiles
against
human
immunodeficiency
virus
(
HIV
)
are
also
discussed
followed
by
a
description
of
the
results
from
a
combination
study
using
anti-HIV
drugs
.
.....
The
results
of
several
studies
regarding
its
novel
antiviral
mechanism
of
action
are
provided
in
conjunction
with
an
explanation
of
viral
resistance
profiles
to
GRFT
.
.....
In
addition
,
its
in
vitro
and
in
vivo
host
toxicity
profiles
are
summarized
with
its
pharmacokinetic
behavior
using
in
vivo
efficacy
study
results
.
.....
Also
,
a
large-scale
production
and
formulation
strategy
,
as
well
as
a
drug
delivery
strategy
,
for
GRFT
as
a
new
class
of
broad-spectrum
microbicides
is
discussed
.
.....
Finally
,
results
from
two
ongoing
clinical
studies
examining
GRFT
's
effects
on
viruses
are
presented
.
.....
Background
:
Porcine
β-defensin
2
(
PBD-2
)
,
produced
by
host
cells
,
is
an
antimicrobial
cysteine-rich
cationic
peptide
with
multi-functions
.
.....
Previous
studies
have
demonstrated
that
PBD-2
can
kill
various
bacteria
,
regulate
host
immune
responses
and
promote
growth
of
piglets
.
.....
However
,
the
antiviral
role
of
PBD-2
is
rarely
investigated
.
.....
This
study
aimed
to
reveal
the
antiviral
ability
of
PBD-2
against
pseudorabies
virus
(
PRV
)
,
the
causative
pathogen
of
Aujeszky
's
disease
,
in
PK-15
cells
and
in
a
PBD-2
expressing
transgenic
(
TG
)
mouse
model
.
.....
Methods
:
In
this
study
,
the
cytotoxicity
of
PBD-2
on
PK-15
cells
was
measured
by
CCK-8
assay
.
.....
PK-15
cells
were
incubated
with
PRV
pre-treated
with
different
concentrations
of
PBD-2
and
PRV
titers
in
cell
culture
supernatants
were
determined
by
real-time
quantitative
PCR
(
RT-qPCR
)
.
.....
TG
mice
and
wild-type
(
WT
)
mice
were
intraperitoneally
injected
with
PRV
and
the
survival
rate
was
recorded
for
10
days
.
.....
Meanwhile
,
tissue
lesions
in
brain
,
spleen
and
liver
of
infected
mice
were
observed
and
the
viral
loads
of
PRV
in
brain
,
liver
and
lung
were
analyzed
by
RT-qPCR
.
.....
Results
:
PBD-2
at
a
maximum
concentration
of
80
μg/mL
displayed
no
significant
cytotoxicity
on
PK-15
cells
.
.....
A
threshold
concentration
of
PBD-2
at
40
μg/mL
was
required
to
inhibit
PRV
proliferation
in
PK-15
cells
.
.....
The
survival
rate
in
PBD-2
TG
mice
was
50
%
higher
than
that
of
WT
mice
.
.....
In
addition
,
TG
mice
showed
alleviated
tissue
lesions
in
brain
,
spleen
and
liver
compared
with
their
WT
littermates
after
PRV
challenge
,
while
viral
loads
of
PRV
in
brain
,
liver
and
lung
of
TG
mice
were
significantly
lower
than
that
of
WT
mice
.
.....
Conclusions
:
PBD-2
could
inhibit
PRV
proliferation
in
PK-15
cells
and
protect
mice
from
PRV
infection
,
which
confirmed
the
antiviral
ability
of
PBD-2
both
in
vitro
and
in
vivo
.
.....
The
application
of
PBD-2
in
developing
anti-viral
drugs
or
disease-resistant
animals
can
be
further
investigated
.
.....
Background
:
Fuelled
by
the
advent
and
subsequent
development
of
next
generation
sequencing
technologies
,
metagenomics
became
a
powerful
tool
for
the
analysis
of
microbial
communities
both
scientifically
and
diagnostically
.
.....
The
biggest
challenge
is
the
extraction
of
relevant
information
from
the
huge
sequence
datasets
generated
for
metagenomics
studies
.
.....
Although
a
plethora
of
tools
are
available
,
data
analysis
is
still
a
bottleneck
.
.....
Results
:
To
overcome
the
bottleneck
of
data
analysis
,
we
developed
an
automated
computational
workflow
called
RIEMS
-Reliable
Information
Extraction
from
Metagenomic
Sequence
datasets
.
.....
RIEMS
assigns
every
individual
read
sequence
within
a
dataset
taxonomically
by
cascading
different
sequence
analyses
with
decreasing
stringency
of
the
assignments
using
various
software
applications
.
.....
After
completion
of
the
analyses
,
the
results
are
summarised
in
a
clearly
structured
result
protocol
organised
taxonomically
.
.....
The
high
accuracy
and
performance
of
RIEMS
analyses
were
proven
in
comparison
with
other
tools
for
metagenomics
data
analysis
using
simulated
sequencing
read
datasets
.
.....
Conclusions
:
RIEMS
has
the
potential
to
fill
the
gap
that
still
exists
with
regard
to
data
analysis
for
metagenomics
studies
.
.....
The
usefulness
and
power
of
RIEMS
for
the
analysis
of
genuine
sequencing
datasets
was
demonstrated
with
an
early
version
of
RIEMS
in
2011
when
it
was
used
to
detect
the
orthobunyavirus
sequences
leading
to
the
discovery
of
Schmallenberg
virus
.

However
,
the

Mouse
hepatitis
virus
type
1
(
MHV-1
)
is
a
group
2
coronavirus
capable
of
causing
severe
morbidity
and
mortality
in
highly
susceptible
C3H/HeJ
mice
.
.....
We
have
previously
shown
that
both
CD4
and
CD8
T
cells
play
a
critical
role
in
mediating
MHV-1-induced
disease
.
.....
Here
we
evaluated
the
role
of
alveolar
macrophages
(
AM
)
in
modulating
the
adaptive
immune
response
and
subsequent
disease
.
.....
Depletion
of
AM
using
clodronate
liposomes
administered
prior
to
MHV-1
infection
was
associated
with
a
significant
amelioration
of
MHV-1induced
morbidity
and
mortality
.
.....
AM
depletion
resulted
in
a
decreased
number
of
virus-specific
CD4
T
cells
in
the
lung
airways
.
.....
In
addition
,
a
significant
increase
in
the
frequency
and
total
number
of
Tregs
in
the
lung
tissue
and
lung
airways
was
observed
following
MHV-1
infection
in
mice
depleted
of
AM
.
.....
Our
results
indicate
that
AM
play
a
critical
role
in
modulating
MHV-1-induced
morbidity
and
mortality
.
